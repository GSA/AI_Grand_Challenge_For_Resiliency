      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part contains the basic policies and procedures of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for adoption of rules. These policies and procedures incorporate those provisions of section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) which FEMA will follow. This part and internal FEMA Manuals implement Executive Order 12291.</P>
              <P>(b) Rules which must be published are described in section 3(a) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a). FEMA implementation of paragraph (a) is contained in 44 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(c) This part contains policies and procedures for implementation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act which took effect January 1, 1981.</P>

              <P>(d) A FEMA Manual No. 1140.1, “The Formulation, Drafting, Clearance, and Publication of <E T="04">Federal Register</E> Documents” has been issued describing the internal procedures including policy level oversight of FEMA for:</P>
              <P>(1) Publishing the semiannual agenda of significant regulations under development and review;</P>
              <P>(2) Making initial determinations with respect to significance of proposed rulemaking;</P>
              <P>(3) Determining the need for regulatory analyses; and</P>
              <P>(4) Reviewing existing regulations, including the reviews required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
              <P>(e) As the FEMA Manual deals with internal management it is not subject to the requirements either of 5 U.S.C. 552 or 553. Its provisions are not part of this rule and reference to it is informative only.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part prescribes general rulemaking procedures for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of rules in which participation by interested persons is required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or other statutes, by Executive Order 12291, by FEMA policy, or by § 1.4 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Any delegation by the Administrator of authority to issue rules may not be further redelegated, unless expressly provided for in the delegation.</P>
              <P>(c) This part does not apply to rules issued in accordance with the formal rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556, 557).</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Policy and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In promulgating new regulations, reviewing existing regulations, and developing legislative proposals concerning regulation, FEMA, to the extent permitted by law, shall adhere to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Administrative decisions shall be based on adequate information concerning the need for and consequences of proposed government action;</P>
              <P>(2) Regulatory action shall not be undertaken unless the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society;</P>
              <P>(3) Regulatory objectives shall be chosen to maximize the net benefits to society;</P>
              <P>(4) Among alternative approaches to any given regulatory objective, the alternative involving the least net cost to society shall be chosen; and</P>
              <P>(5) FEMA shall set regulatory priorities with the aim of maximizing the aggregate net benefits to society, taking into account the condition of the particular entities affected by regulations, the condition of the national economy, and other regulatory actions contemplated for the future.</P>
              <P>(b) It is the policy of FEMA to provide for public participation in rulemaking regarding its programs and functions, including matters that relate to public property, loans, grants, or benefits, or contracts, even though these matters are not subject to a requirement for notice and public comment rulemaking by law.</P>

              <P>(c) FEMA will publish notices of proposed rulemaking in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and will give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views, and arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.</P>
              <P>(d) In order to give the public, including small entities and consumer groups, an early and meaningful opportunity to participate in the development of rules, for a number of regulations the Administrator will employ additional methods of inviting public participation. These methods include, but are not limited to, publishing advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), which can include a statement with respect to the impact of the proposed rule on small entities; holding open conferences; convening public forums or panels, sending notices of proposed regulations to publications likely to be read by those affected and soliciting comment from interested parties by such means as direct mail. An ANPR should be used to solicit public comment early in the rulemaking process for significant rules.</P>

              <P>(e) It is the policy of FEMA that its notices of proposed rulemaking are to afford the public at least sixty days for <PRTPAGE P="9"/>submission of comments unless the Administrator makes an exception and sets forth the reasons for the exception in the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking. This period shall also include any period of review required by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.</P>
              <P>(f) Unless required by statute or Executive Order, notice and public procedure may be omitted if the Administrator, for good cause, determines in a particular case or class of cases that notice and public procedure is impractical, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest and sets forth the reason for the determination in the rulemaking document or, for a class of cases, in a published rule or statement of policy. In a particular case, the reasons for the determination will be stated in the rulemaking document. Notice and public procedure may also be omitted with respect to statements of policy, interpretative rules, rules governing FEMA's organization or its own internal practices or procedures, or if a statute expressly authorizes omission.</P>
              <P>(g) A final substantive rule will be published not less than 30 days before its effective date unless it grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction or unless the rulemaking document states good cause for its taking effect less than 30 days after publication.

              <P>(a) FEMA shall, in connection with any major rule, prepare and consider a Regulatory Impact Analysis. Such analysis may be combined with the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis described in §§ 1.12(f) and 1.16(c) of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) FEMA shall initially determine whether a rule it intends to propose or to issue is a major rule and, if a major rule, shall prepare Regulatory Impact Analyses and transmit them, along with all notices of proposed rulemaking and all final rules, to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If no notice of proposed rulemaking is to be published for a proposed major rule that is not an emergency rule, the agency shall prepare only a final Regulatory Impact Analysis, which shall be transmitted, along with the proposed rule, to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, at least 60 days prior to the publication of the major rule as a final rule;</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to all other major rules, FEMA shall prepare a preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis, which shall be transmitted, along with a notice of proposed rulemaking, to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, at least 60 days prior to the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, and a final Regulatory Impact Analysis, which shall be transmitted along with the final rule at least 30 days prior to the publication of the major rule as a final rule;</P>

              <P>(3) For all rules other than major rules, FEMA shall, unless an exemption has been granted, submit to the Director, Office of Management and <PRTPAGE P="11"/>Budget, at least 10 days prior to publication, every notice of proposed rulemaking and final rule.</P>
              <P>(c) To permit each major rule to be analyzed in light of the requirements stated in section 2 of Executive Order 12291, each preliminary and final Regulatory Impact Analysis shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of the potential benefits of the rule, including any beneficial effects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the potential costs of the rule, including any adverse effects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to bear the costs;</P>
              <P>(3) A determination of the potential net benefits of the rule, including an evaluation of effects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms;</P>
              <P>(4) A description of alternative approaches that could substantially achieve the same regulatory goal at lower cost, together with an analysis of this potential benefit and costs and a brief explanation of the legal reasons why such alternatives, if proposed, could not be adopted; and</P>
              <P>(5) Unless covered by the description required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an explanation of any legal reasons why the rule cannot be based on the requirements set forth in section 2 of Executive Order 12291.</P>

If the Administrator finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Administrator may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.</P>

            <P>(b) The Administrator provides notice to directly affected State, areawide, regional, and local entities in a State of proposed Federal financial assistance or direct Federal development if:</P>
            <P>(1) The State has not adopted a process under the Order; or</P>
            <P>(2) The assistance or development involves a program or activity not selected for the State process.</P>

            <P>(2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation for a program selected under § 4.6.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from State, areawide, regional or local officials and entities where there is no state process recommendation.</P>
            <P>(2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.</P>

            <P>(e) The Administrator considers comments which do not constitute a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which the Administrator is not required to apply the procedures of § 4.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single point of contact, by the applicant or directly to FEMA by a commenting party.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does the Administrator make efforts to accommodate intergovernmental concerns?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If a state process provides a state process recommendation to FEMA through its single point of contact, the Administrator either:</P>
            <P>(1) Accepts the recommendation;</P>
            <P>(2) Reaches a mutually agreeable solution with the state process; or</P>
            <P>(3) Provides the single point of contact with such written explanation of the decision, as the Administrator in his or her discretion deems appropriate. The Administrator may also supplement the written explanation by providing the explanation to the single point of contact by telephone, other telecommunication, or other means.</P>
            <P>(b) In any explanation under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Administrator informs the single point of contact that:</P>
            <P>(1) FEMA will not implement its decision for at least ten days after the single point of contact receives the explanation; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator has reviewed the decision and determined that, because of unusual circumstances, the waiting period of at least ten days is not feasible.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of computing the waiting period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a single point of contact is presumed to have received written notification 5 days after the date of mailing of such notification.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 4.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What are the Administrator's obligations in interstate situations?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Administrator is responsible for:</P>
            <P>(1) Identifying proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development that have an impact on interstate areas;</P>
            <P>(2) Notifying appropriate officials and entities in states which have adopted a process and which select FEMA's program or activity;</P>
            <P>(3) Making efforts to identify and notify the affected State, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities in those States that have not adopted a process under the Order or do not select FEMA's program or activity;</P>
            <P>(4) Responding pursuant to § 4.10 of this part if the Administrator receives a recommendation from a designated areawide agency transmitted by a single point of contact, in cases in which the review, coordination, and communication with FEMA have been delegated.</P>

            <P>(b) The Administrator uses the procedures in § 4.10 if a state process provides a state process recommendation <PRTPAGE P="17"/>to FEMA through a single point of contact.</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Substitute</E> means that a State may use a plan or other document that it has developed for its own purposes to meet Federal requirements.</P>
            <P>(b) If not inconsistent with law, a State may decide to try to simplify, consolidate, or substitute federally required state plans without prior approval by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(c) The Administrator reviews each state plan that a State has simplified, consolidated, or substituted and accepts the plan only if its contents meet Federal requirements.</P>

              <P>(c) This subpart does not apply to Congressional requests or subpoenas for testimony or documents, or to an employee making an appearance solely in his or her private capacity in judicial or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the Agency (such as cases arising out of traffic accidents, domestic relations, etc.).</P>
              <P>(d) The Department of Homeland Security's regulations, 6 CFR 5.41 through 5.49, apply to any subject matter not already covered by this subpart, including but not limited to demands or requests directed to current or former FEMA contractors.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Statement of policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is the policy of FEMA to make its records available to private litigants to the same extent and in the same manner as such records are made available to members of the general public, except where protected from disclosure by litigation procedural authority (e.g., Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) or other applicable law.</P>
              <P>(b) It is FEMA's policy and responsibility to preserve its human resources for performance of the official functions of the Agency and to maintain strict impartiality with respect to private litigants. Participation by FEMA employees in private litigation in their official capacities is generally contrary to this policy.</P>

              <P>(c) The Chief Counsel, after consultation with other appropriate officials as deemed necessary, shall promptly determine whether to disclose the material or documents identified in the subpoena or other demand. Generally, authorization to furnish the requested material or documents shall not be withheld unless their disclosure is prohibited by relevant law or for other compelling reasons.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever a subpoena or demand commanding the production of any record is served upon any Agency employee other than as provided in § 5.83 of this subpart, or the response to a demand is required before the receipt of instructions from the Chief Counsel, such employee shall appear in response thereto, respectfully decline to produce the record(s) on the ground that it is prohibited by this section and state that the demand has been referred for the prompt consideration of the Chief Counsel.</P>

              <P>(e) Where the release of documents in response to a subpoena duces tecum is authorized by the Chief Counsel, the official having custody of the requested records will furnish, upon the request of the party seeking disclosure, authenticated copies of the documents. <PRTPAGE P="19"/>No official or employee of FEMA shall respond in strict compliance with the terms of a subpoena duces tecum unless specifically authorized by the Chief Counsel.</P>

              <P>(b) Whenever a demand is made upon a FEMA employee, for the disclosure of information described in paragraph (a) of this section, that employee shall immediately notify the Office of Chief Counsel. The Chief Counsel, upon receipt of such notice and absent waiver of the general prohibition against employee testimony at his or her discretion, shall arrange with the appropriate United States Attorney the taking of such steps as are necessary to quash the subpoena or seek a protective order.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event that an immediate demand for testimony or disclosure is made in circumstances which would preclude prior notice to and consultation with the Chief Counsel, the employee shall respectfully request from the demanding authority a stay in the proceedings to allow sufficient time to obtain advice of counsel.</P>

              <P>(d) If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section pending consultation with counsel, or if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions not to testify or disclose the information sought, the employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing these regulations and <E T="03">United States ex rel.

In <PRTPAGE P="20"/>granting such waiver, the Chief Counsel shall attach to the waiver such reasonable conditions and limitations as are deemed appropriate in order that a response in strict compliance with the terms of a subpoena duces tecum or the providing of testimony will not interfere with the duties of the employee and will otherwise conform to the policies of this part. The Administrator may, in his or her discretion, review any decision to authorize a waiver of any policy or procedure prescribed by this subpart.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasons for exemptions.</E> (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would give individuals an opportunity to learn whether <PRTPAGE P="31"/>they are of record either as suspects or as subjects of a criminal investigation; this would compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to complete investigations and identify or detect violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Individuals would be able (A) to take steps to avoid detection, (B) to inform co-conspirators of the fact that an investigation is being conducted, (C) to learn the nature of the investigation to which they are being subjected, (D) to learn the type of surveillance being utilized, (E) to learn whether they are only suspects or identified law violators, (F) to continue to resume their illegal conduct without fear of detection upon learning that they are not in a particular system of records, and (G) to destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.</P>
              <P>(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would compromise its ability to complete or continue criminal investigations and to detect or identify violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed system of records would provide individuals with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, and this could enable them to avoid detection or apprehension in the following ways:</P>
              <P>(A) By discovering the collection of facts which would form the basis for their arrest, (B) by enabling them to destroy evidence of criminal conduct which would form the basis for their arrest, and (C) by learning that the criminal investigators had reason to believe that a crime was about to be committed, they could delay the commission of the crime or change the scene of the crime to a location which might not be under surveillance. Granting access to ongoing or closed investigative files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the knowledge of which could enable individuals planning criminal activity to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing law enforcement officers' established investigative tools and procedures. Further, granting access to investigative files and records could disclose the identity of confidential sources and other informers and the nature of the information which they supplied, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those sources of information by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided information relating to the criminal activities of those individuals who are the subjects of the investigative files and records; confidential sources and other informers might refuse to provide criminal investigators with valuable information if they could not be secure in the knowledge that their identities would not be revealed through disclosure of either their names or the nature of the information they supplied, and this would seriously impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mandate to enforce criminal and related laws. Additionally, providing access to records contained in the above-listed system of records could reveal the identities of undercover law enforcement personnel who compiled information regarding individual's criminal activities, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those undercover personnel or their families by exposing them to possible reprisals.</P>

              <P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4), which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph and, accordingly, those <PRTPAGE P="32"/>reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</P>
              <P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of other law enforcement agencies to make effective use of information provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the investigation, detection and apprehension of violators of the criminal laws enforced by those other law enforcement agencies. Making accountings of disclosure available to violators or possible violators would alert those individuals to the fact that another agency is conducting an investigation into their criminal activities, and this could reveal the geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other geographic areas or by destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for their arrest. In addition, providing violators with accountings of disclosure would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has information regarding their criminal activities and could inform those individuals of the general nature of that information; this, in turn, would afford those individuals a better opportunity to take appropriate steps to avoid detection or apprehension for violations of criminal and related laws.</P>
              <P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires that an agency inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. Since this provision is dependent on an individual's having been provided an opportunity to contest (seek amendment to) records pertaining to him/her, and since the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt from those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to amendments of records as indicated in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that this provision should not be applicable to the above system of records.</P>

              <P>(vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires that an agency publish a public notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a system of records. The categories of sources of this system of records have been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</P>

              <P>(vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The term <E T="03">maintain</E> as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes “collect” and “disseminate.” At the time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there is often insufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages of an investigation, and in many cases, information which <PRTPAGE P="33"/>initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation, prove to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law discovered during a criminal investigation fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the conduct of a lawful FEMA investigation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, therefore, believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).</P>
              <P>(viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires that an agency collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct investigations and to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(A) Most information collected about an individual under criminal investigations is obtained from third parties such as witnesses and informers, and it is usually not feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for information regarding his/her criminal activities, (B) an attempt to obtain information from the subject of a criminal investigation will often alert that individual to the existence of an investigation, thereby affording the individual an opportunity to attempt to conceal his/her criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension, (C) in certain instances, the subject of a criminal investigation is not required to supply information to criminal investigators as a matter of legal duty, and (D) during criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound investigative procedures to obtain information from a variety of sources in order to verify information already obtained.</P>

              <P>(ix) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires that an agency inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, either on the form which the agency uses to collect the information or on a separate form which can be retained by the individual, with the following information: The authority which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; the routine uses which may be made of the information; and the effects on the individual of not providing all or part of the requested information. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision in order to avoid adverse effects on its ability to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws. In many cases, information is obtained by confidential sources, other informers or undercover law enforcement officers under circumstances where it is necessary that the true purpose of their actions be kept secret so as to avoid alerting the subject of the investigation or his/her associates that a criminal investigation is in process. Further, if it became known that the undercover officer was assisting in a criminal investigation, that officer's life or physical safety could be endangered through reprisal, and, under such circumstances it may not be possible to continue to utilize that officer in the investigation. In many cases, individuals, for personal reasons, would feel inhibited in talking to a person representing a criminal law enforcement agency but would be willing to talk to a confidential source or undercover officer who they believe is not involved in law enforcement activities. <PRTPAGE P="34"/>In addition, providing a source of information with written evidence that he was a source, as required by this provision, could increase the likelihood that the source of information would be the subject of retaliatory action by the subject of the investigation. Further, application of this provision could result in an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the subject of the criminal investigation, particularly where further investigation would result in a finding that the subject was not involved in any criminal activity.</P>
              <P>(x) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires that an agency maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines “maintain” to include “collect” and “disseminate,” application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would hinder the initial collection of any information which could not, at the moment of collection, be determined to be accurate, relevant, timely and complete. Similarly, application of this provision would seriously restrict the necessary flow of information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to other law enforcement agencies when a FEMA investigation revealed information pertaining to a violation of law which was under investigative jurisdiction of another agency. In collecting information during the course of a criminal investigation, it is not possible or feasible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to collection of the information; in disseminating information to other law enforcement agencies it is often not possible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to dissemination because the disseminating agency may not have the expertise with which to make such determinations. Further, information which may initially appear to be inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or incomplete may, when gathered, grouped, and evaluated with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses. In addition, application of this provision could seriously impede criminal investigators and intelligence analysts in the exercise of their judgment in reporting on results obtained during criminal investigations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5).</P>
              <P>(xi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires that an agency make reasonable effort to serve notice on an individual when any record on the individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempt from this provision in order to avoid revealing investigative techniques and procedures outlined in those records and in order to prevent revelation of the existence on an on-going investigation where there is a need to keep the existence of the investigation secret.</P>

              <P>(xii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides civil remedies to an individual for an agency's refusal to amend a record or to make a review of a request for amendment; for an agency's refusal to grant access to a record; for an agency's failure to maintain accurate, relevant, timely and complete records which are used to make a determination which is adverse to the individual; and for an agency's failure to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision to the extent that the civil remedies provided therein may relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt. Since the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a enumerated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section are proposed to be inapplicable to the above-listed systems of records for the reasons stated therein, there should be no corresponding civil remedies for failure to comply with the requirements of those provisions to which the exemption is proposed to apply. Further, the <PRTPAGE P="35"/>Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would adversely affect its ability to conduct criminal investigations by exposing to civil court action every stage of the criminal investigative process in which information is compiled or used in order to identify, detect, or otherwise investigate persons suspected or known to be engaged in criminal conduct.</P>
              <P>(xiii) Individuals may not have access to another agency's records, which are contained in files maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when that other agency's regulations provide that such records are subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records are within a request for access, FEMA will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasons for exemptions.</E> (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of FEMA to successfully complete investigations and inquiries of suspected violators of civil and criminal laws and regulations under its jurisdiction. In many cases investigations and inquiries into violations of civil and criminal laws and regulations involve complex and continuing patterns of behavior. Individuals, if informed, that they have been identified as suspected violators of civil or criminal laws and regulations, would have an opportunity to take measures to prevent detection of illegal action so as to avoid prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. They would also be able to learn the nature and location of the investigation or inquiry, the type of surveillance being utilized, and they would be able to transmit this knowledge to co-conspirators. Finally, violators might be given the opportunity to destroy evidence needed to prove the violation under investigation or inquiry.</P>

              <P>(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair its ability to complete or continue civil or <PRTPAGE P="36"/>criminal investigations and inquiries and to detect violators of civil or criminal laws. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed systems of records would provide violators with significant information concerning the nature of the civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. Knowledge of the facts developed during an investigation or inquiry would enable violators of criminal and civil laws and regulations to learn the extent to which the investigation or inquiry has progressed, and this could provide them with an opportunity to destroy evidence that would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. In addition, knowledge gained through access to investigatory material could alert a violator to the need to temporarily postpone commission of the violation or to change the intended point where the violation is to be committed so as to avoid detection or apprehension. Further, access to investigatory material would disclose investigative techniques and procedures which, if known, could enable violators to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing investigators' established and effective investigative tools and procedures. In addition, investigatory material may contain the identity of a confidential source of information or other informer who would not want his/her identity to be disclosed for reasons of personal privacy or for fear of reprisal at the hands of the individual about whom he/she supplied information. In some cases mere disclosure of the information provided by an informer would reveal the identity of the informer either through the process of elimination or by virtue of the nature of the information supplied. If informers cannot be assured that their identities (as sources for information) will remain confidential, they would be very reluctant in the future to provide information pertaining to violations of criminal and civil laws and regulations, and this would seriously compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mission. Further, application of 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) to the above-listed systems of records would make available attorney's work product and other documents which contain evaluations, recommendations, and discussions of on-going civil and criminal legal proceedings; the availability of such documents could have a chilling effect on the free flow of information and ideas within the Federal Emergency Management Agency which is vital to the agency's predecisional deliberative process, could seriously prejudice the agency's or the Government's position in a civil or criminal litigation, and could result in the disclosure of investigatory material which should not be disclosed for the reasons stated above. It is the belief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that, in both civil actions and criminal prosecutions, due process will assure that individuals have a reasonable opportunity to learn of the existence of, and to challenge, investigatory records and related materials which are to be used in legal proceedings.</P>
              <P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4) which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph, and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</P>

              <P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of the Federal <PRTPAGE P="37"/>Emergency Management Agency and other law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations and inquiries into civil and criminal violations under their respective jurisdictions. Making accountings available to violators would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or another law enforcement authority is conducting an investigation or inquiry into their activities, and such accountings could reveal the geographic location of the investigation or inquiry, the nature and purpose of the investigation or inquiry and the nature of the information disclosed, and the date on which that investigation or inquiry was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, transferring their activities to other locations or destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions.</P>

              <P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The term <E T="03">maintain</E> as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes “collect” and “disseminate.” At the time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency there is often insufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages of investigation or inquiry, and in many cases information which initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation or inquiry, prove to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law uncovered during a Federal Emergency Management Agency inquiry fall within the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the conduct of a lawful FEMAs civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. The Federal Emergency Management Agency therefore believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed systems of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasons for exemptions.</E> All information about individuals in these records that meet the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosure available to the subject and access to and amendment of records. These exemptions are claimed because the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC-1, Security Management Information System, contains investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for access to classified <PRTPAGE P="38"/>information or classified Federal contracts, but only to the extent that the disclosure would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. During the litigation process and investigations, it is possible that certain records from the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC-1, Security Management System may be necessary and relevant to the litigation or investigation and included in these systems of records. To the extent that this occurs, the Administrator, FEMA, has determined that the records would also be exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) to protect such records. A determination will be made at the time of the request for a record concerning whether specific information would reveal the identity of a source. This exemption is required in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of information compiled for the purpose of determining access to classified information. This confidentiality helps maintain the Government's continued access to information from persons who would otherwise refuse to give it.</P>

This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and section 12(c) of this regulation and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the National Headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible agency official unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the agency requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible agency official or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the agency shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the agency and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</P>

              <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this regulation, but rules or <PRTPAGE P="45"/>principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this regulation with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this regulation applies, or noncompliance with this regulation and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this regulation. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with section 14.</P>

However, for good cause showing, FEMA may extend this time limit.</P>

                <P>(b) FEMA will consider the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient to be processed. A complaint is deemed “sufficient” when it contains particulars (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone numbers of parties involved; date(s) of alleged discrimination; kind(s) of alleged discrimination) upon which to begin an investigation.<PRTPAGE P="51"/>

The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to FEMA. FEMA will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.</P>
                <P>(d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.</P>
                <P>(e) The mediation will proceed for a maximum of 60 days after a complaint is filed with FEMA. Mediation ends if:</P>
                <P>(1) Sixty days elapse from the time the complaint is filed; or</P>
                <P>(2) Prior to the end of that 60 day period, an agreement is reached; or</P>
                <P>(3) Prior to the end of that 60 day period, the mediator determines that an agreement cannot be reached. This 60 day period may be extended by the mediator, with the concurrence of FEMA, for not more than 30 days if the mediator determines agreement will likely be reached during such extended period.</P>

                <P>(2) As part of the initial investigation, FEMA will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussion with the complainant and recipient, to establish the facts and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. FEMA may seek the assistance of any involved state agency.</P>
                <P>(3) FEMA will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official at FEMA.</P>
                <P>(4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of FEMA, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.</P>

                <P>(3) FEMA will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity FEMA finds in violation of this regulation.

              <E T="03">Coastal High Hazard Area</E> means the areas subject to high velocity waters including but not limited to hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. On a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), this appears as zone V1-30, VE or V.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Critical Action</E> means an action for which even a slight chance of flooding is too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical actions is the 500-year floodplain, i.e., critical action floodplain. Critical actions include, but are not limited to, those which create or extend the useful life of structures or facilities:</P>
            <P>(a) Such as those which produce, use or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic or water-reactive materials;</P>
            <P>(b) Such as hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) These regulations apply to all Agency actions which have the potential to affect floodplains or wetlands or their occupants, or which are subject to potential harm by location in floodplains or wetlands.</P>
            <P>(2) The basic test of the potential of an action to affect floodplains or wetlands is the action's potential (both by itself and when viewed cumulatively with other proposed actions) to result in the long- or short-term adverse impacts associated with:</P>
            <P>(i) The occupancy or modification of floodplains, and the direct and indirect support of floodplain development; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The destruction or modification of wetlands and the direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands.</P>
            <P>(3) This regulation applies to actions that were, on the effective date of the Orders (May 24, 1977), ongoing, in the planning and/or development stages, or undergoing implementation, and are incomplete as of the effective date of these regulations. The regulation also applies to proposed (new) actions. The Agency shall:</P>

            <P>(i) Determine the applicable provisions of the Orders by analyzing whether the action in question has progressed beyond critical stages in the floodplain management and wetlands protection decision-making process, as <PRTPAGE P="58"/>set out below in § 9.6. This determination need only be made at the time that followup actions are being taken to complete or implement the action in question; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Apply the provisions of the Orders and of this regulation to all such actions to the fullest extent practicable.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limited exemption of ongoing actions involving wetlands located outside the floodplains.</E> (1) Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, contains a limited exemption not found in Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management. Therefore, this exemption applies only to actions affecting wetlands which are located outside the floodplains, and which have no potential to result in harm to or within floodplains or to support floodplain development.</P>
            <P>(2) The following proposed actions that impact wetlands located outside of floodplains are exempt from this regulation:</P>
            <P>(i) Agency-assisted or permitted projects which were under construction before May 24, 1977; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Projects for which the Agency has proposed a draft of a final environmental impact statement (EIS) which adequately analyzes the action and which was filed before October 1, 1977. Proposed actions that impact wetlands outside of floodplains are not exempt if the EIS:</P>
            <P>(A) Only generally covers the proposed action;</P>
            <P>(B) Is devoted largely to related activities; or</P>
            <P>(C) Treats the project area or program without an adequate and specific analysis of the floodplain and wetland implications of the proposed action.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Decision-making involving certain categories of actions.</E> The provisions set forth in this regulation are <E T="03">not applicable</E> to the actions enumerated below except that the Regional Administrators shall comply with the spirit of the Order to the extent practicable. For any action which is excluded from the actions enumerated below, the full 8-step process applies (see § 9.6) (except as indicated at paragraphs (d), (f) and (g) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusions). The provisions of these regulations do not apply to the following (all references are to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-288, as amended, except as noted):</P>
            <P>(1) Assistance provided for emergency work essential to save lives and protect property and public health and safety performed pursuant to sections 305 and 306;</P>

            <P>(14) Placement of families in existing resources and Temporary Relocation Assistance provided to those families so placed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, Public Law 96-510.</P>

            <P>(d) For each action enumerated below, the Regional Administrator <E T="03">shall apply steps 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8</E> of the decision-making process (§§ 9.7, 9.8, 9.10 and 9.11, see § 9.6). Steps 3 and 6 (§ 9.9) shall be carried out except that alternative sites outside the floodplain or wetland need not be considered. After assessing impacts of the proposed action on the floodplain or wetlands and of the site on the proposed action, alternative actions to the proposed action, if any, and the “no action” alternative shall be considered. The Regional Administrator may also require certain other portions of the decision-making process to be carried out for individual actions as is deemed necessary. For any action which is excluded from the actions listed below. (except as indicated in paragraphs (c), (f) and (g) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion), the full 8-step process applies (see § 9.6).

            <P>(ii) The action is located in a floodway or coastal high hazard area, or</P>
            <P>(iii) The facility or structure is one which has previously sustained structural damage from flooding due to a major disaster or emergency or on which a flood insurance claim has been paid, or</P>
            <P>(iv) The action is a critical action.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Other categories of actions.</E> Based upon the completion of the 8-step decision-making process (§ 9.6), the Director may find that a specific category of actions either offers no potential for carrying out the purposes of the Orders and shall be treated as those actions listed in § 9.5(c), or has no practicable alternative sites and shall be treated as those actions listed in § 9.5(d), or has no practicable alternative actions or sites and shall be treated as those actions listed in § 9.5(g). This finding will be made in consultation with the Federal Insurance Administration and the Council on Environmental Quality as provided in section 2(d) of E.O. 11988. Public notice of each of these determinations shall include publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and a 30-day comment period.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</E> (1) Most of what is done by FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, in administering the National Flood Insurance Program is performed on a program-wide basis. For all regulations, procedures or other issuances making or amending program policy, FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, shall apply the 8-step decision-making process to that program-wide action. The action to which the 8-step process must be applied is the establishment of programmatic standards or criteria, not the application of programmatic standards or criteria to specific situations. Thus, for example, FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, would apply the 8-step process to a programmatic determination of categories of structures to be insured, but not to whether to insure each individual structure. The two prime examples of where FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, does take site specific actions which would require individual application of the 8-step process are property acquisition under section 1362 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, and the issuance of an exception to <PRTPAGE P="60"/>a community under 44 CFR 60.6(b). (See also § 9.9(e)(6) and § 9.11(e).)</P>
            <P>(2) The provisions set forth in this regulation are not applicable to the actions enumerated below except that the Federal Insurance Administrator or the Assistant Administrator for Mitigation, as appropriate shall comply with the spirit of the Orders to the extent practicable:</P>
            <P>(i) The issuance of individual flood insurance policies and policy interpretations;</P>
            <P>(ii) The adjustment of claims made under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy;</P>
            <P>(iii) The hiring of independent contractors to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program;</P>
            <P>(iv) The issuance of individual flood insurance maps, Map Information Facility map determinations, and map amendments; and</P>
            <P>(v) The conferring of eligibility for emergency or regular program (NFIP) benefits upon communities.</P>

            <P>(g) For the action listed below, the Regional Administrator <E T="03">shall apply steps 1, 4, 5 and 8</E> of the decision-making process (§§ 9.7, 9.10 and 9.11). For any action which is excluded from the actions listed below, (except as indicated in paragraphs (c), (d) and (f) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion), the full 8-step process applies (See § 9.6). The Regional Administrator may also require certain other portions of the decision-making process to be carried out for individual actions as is deemed necessary. The references are to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, Public Law 93-288. The above requirements apply to repairs, under section 402, between $5,000 and $25,000 to damaged structures of facilities except for:</P>
            <P>(1) Actions in a floodway or coastal high hazard area; or</P>
            <P>(2) New or substantially improved structures or facilities; or</P>
            <P>(3) Facilities or structures which have previously sustained structural damage from flooding due to a major disaster or emergency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Decision-making process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this section is to set out the floodplain management and wetlands protection decision-making process to be followed by the Agency in applying the Orders to its actions. While the decision-making process was initially designed to address the floodplain Order's requirements, the process will also satisfy the wetlands Order's provisions due to the close similarity of the two directives. The numbering of Steps 1 through 8 does not firmly require that the steps be followed sequentially. As information is gathered throughout the decision-making process and as additional information is needed, reevaluation of lower numbered steps may be necessary.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as otherwise provided in § 9.5 (c), (d), (f), and (g) regarding categories of partial or total exclusion when proposing an action, the Agency shall apply the 8-step decision-making process. FEMA shall:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Determine whether the proposed action is located in a wetland and/or the 100-year floodplain (500-year floodplain for critical actions); and whether it has the potential to affect or be affected by a floodplain or wetland (see § 9.7);</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Notify the public at the earliest possible time of the intent to carry out an action in a floodplain or wetland, and involve the affected and interested public in the decision-making process (see § 9.8);</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to locating the proposed action in a floodplain or wetland (including alternative sites, actions and the “no action” option) (see § 9.9). If a practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland FEMA must locate the action at the alternative site.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 4.</E> Identify the potential direct and indirect impacts associated with the occupancy or modification of floodplains and wetlands and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action (see § 9.10);</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 5.</E> Minimize the potential adverse impacts and support to or within <PRTPAGE P="61"/>floodplains and wetlands to be identified under Step 4, restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains, and preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values served by wetlands (see § 9.11);</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 6.</E> Reevaluate the proposed action to determine first, if it is still practicable in light of its exposure to flood hazards, the extent to which it will aggravate the hazards to others, and its potential to disrupt floodplain and wetland values and second, if alternatives preliminarily rejected at Step 3 are practicable in light of the information gained in Steps 4 and 5. FEMA shall not act in a floodplain or wetland unless it is the only practicable location (see § 9.9);</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 7.</E> Prepare and provide the public with a finding and public explanation of any final decision that the floodplain or wetland is the only practicable alternative (see § 9.12); and</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Step 8.</E> Review the implementation and post-implementation phases of the proposed action to ensure that the requirements stated in § 9.11 are fully implemented. Oversight responsibility shall be integrated into existing processes.</P>

            <P>(a) The purpose of this section is to establish Agency procedures for determining whether any action as proposed is located in or affects (1) the base floodplain (the Agency shall substitute the 500-year floodplain for the base floodplain where the action being proposed involves a critical action), or (2) a wetland.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Information needed.</E> The Agency shall obtain enough information so that it can fulfill the requirements of the Orders to (1) avoid floodplain and wetland locations unless they are the only practicable alternatives; and (2) minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands. In all cases, FEMA shall determine whether the proposed action is located in a floodplain or wetland. In the absence of a finding to the contrary, FEMA may assume that a proposed action involving a facility or structure that has been flooded is in the floodplain. Information about the 100-year and 500-year floods and location of floodways and coastal high hazard areas may also be needed to comply with these regulations, especially § 9.11. The following additional flooding characteristics shall be identified by the Regional Administrator as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(i) Velocity of floodwater;</P>
            <P>(ii) Rate of rise of floodwater;</P>
            <P>(iii) Duration of flooding;</P>

            <P>(ii) If a detailed map (FIRM or FBFM) is not available, the Regional Administrator shall consult an FEMA Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) . If data on flood elevations, floodways, or coastal high hazard areas are needed, or if the map does not delineate the flood hazard boundaries in the vicinity of the proposed site, the Regional Administrator shall seek the necessary detailed information and assistance from the sources listed below.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Wetland determination.</E> The following sequence shall be followed by the Agency in making the wetland determination.</P>
            <P>(1) The Agency shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for information concerning the location, scale and type of wetlands within the area which could be affected by the proposed action.</P>
            <P>(2) If the FWS does not have adequate information upon which to base the determination, the Agency shall consult wetland inventories maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, various states, communities and others.</P>
            <P>(3) If state or other sources do not have adequate information upon which to base the determination, the Agency shall carry out an on-site analysis performed by a representative of the FWS or other qualified individual for wetlands characteristics based on the performance definition of what constitutes a wetland.</P>
            <P>(4) If an action is in a wetland but not in a floodplain, and the action is new construction, the provisions of this regulation shall apply. Even if the action is not in a wetland, the Regional Administrator shall determine if the action has the potential to result in indirect impacts on wetlands. If so, all adverse impacts shall be minimized. For actions which are in a wetland and the floodplain, completion of the decision-making process is required. (See § 9.6.) In such a case the wetland will be considered as one of the natural and beneficial values of floodplain.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this section is to establish the initial notice procedures to be followed when proposing any action in or affecting floodplains or wetlands.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> The Agency shall provide adequate information to enable the public to have impact on the decision outcome for all actions having potential to affect, adversely, or be affected by floodplains or wetlands that it proposes. To achieve this objective, the Agency shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Provide the public with adequate information and opportunity for review and comment at the earliest possible time and throughout the decision-making process; and upon completion of this process, provide the public with an accounting of its final decisions (see § 9.12); and</P>
            <P>(2) Rely on its environmental assessment processes, to the extent possible, as vehicles for public notice, involvement and explanation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Early public notice.</E> The Agency shall provide opportunity for public involvement in the decision-making process through the provision of public notice upon determining that the proposed action can be expected to affect or be affected by floodplains or wetlands. Whenever possible, notice shall precede major project site identification and analysis in order to preclude the foreclosure of options consistent with the Orders.</P>
            <P>(1) For an action for which an environmental impact statement is being prepared, the Notice of Intent to File an EIS is adequate to constitute the early public notice, if it includes the information required under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) For each action having national significance for which notice is being <PRTPAGE P="63"/>provided, the Agency shall use the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as the minimum means for notice, and shall provide notice by mail to national organizations reasonably expected to be interested in the action. The additional notices listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall be used in accordance with the determination made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) The Agency shall base its determination of appropriate notices, adequate comment periods, and whether to issue cumulative notices (paragraphs (c)(4), (6) and (7) of this section) on factors which include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Scale of the action;</P>
            <P>(ii) Potential for controversy;</P>
            <P>(iii) Degree of public need;</P>
            <P>(iv) Number of affected agencies and individuals; and</P>
            <P>(v) Its anticipated potential impact.</P>
            <P>(4) For each action having primarily local importance for which notice is being provided, notice shall be made in accordance with the criteria under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and shall entail as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(i) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(ii) Notice to Indian tribes when effects may occur on reservations.</P>
            <P>(iii) Information required in the affected State's public notice procedures for comparable actions.</P>
            <P>(iv) Publication in local newspapers (in papers of general circulation rather than legal papers).</P>
            <P>(v) Notice through other local media.</P>
            <P>(vi) Notice to potentially interested community organizations.</P>
            <P>(vii) Publication in newsletters that may be expected to reach potentially interested persons.</P>
            <P>(viii) Direct mailing to owners and occupants of nearby or affected property.</P>
            <P>(ix) Posting of notice on and off site in the area where the action is to be located.</P>
            <P>(x) Holding a public hearing.</P>
            <P>(5) The notice shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of the action, its purpose and a statement of the intent to carry out an action affecting or affected by a floodplain or wetland;</P>
            <P>(ii) Based on the factors in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a map of the area or other indentification of the floodplain and/or wetland areas which is of adequate scale and detail so that the location is discernible; instead of publication of such map, FEMA may state that such map is available for public inspection, including the location at which such map may be inspected and a telephone number to call for information;</P>
            <P>(iii) Based on the factors in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a description of the type, extent and degree of hazard involved and the floodplain or wetland values present; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Identification of the responsible official or organization for implementing the proposed action, and from whom further information can be obtained.</P>
            <P>(6) The Agency shall provide for an adequate comment period.</P>
            <P>(7) In a post-disaster situation in particular, the requirement for early public notice may be met in a cumulative manner based on the factors set out in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Several actions may be addressed in one notice or series of notices. For some actions involving limited public interest a single notice in a local newspaper or letter to interested parties may suffice.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuing public notice.</E> The Agency shall keep the public informed of the progress of the decision-making process through additional public notices at key points in the process. The preliminary information provided under paragraph (c)(5) of this section shall be augmented by the findings of the adverse effects of the proposed actions and steps necessary to mitigate them. This responsibility shall be performed for actions requiring the preparation of an EIS, and all other actions having the potential for major adverse impacts, or the potential for harm to the health and safety of the general public.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Analysis and reevaluation of practicable alternatives.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) The purpose of this section is to expand upon the directives set out in § 9.6, of this part, in order to clarify and emphasize the Orders' key requirements to avoid floodplains and <PRTPAGE P="64"/>wetlands unless there is no practicable alternative.</P>
            <P>(2) Step 3 is a preliminary determination as to whether the floodplain is the only practicable location for the action. It is a preliminary determination because it comes early in the decision-making process when the Agency has a limited amount of information. If it is clear that there is a practicable alternative, or the floodplain or wetland is itself not a practicable location, FEMA shall then act on that basis. Provided that the location outside the floodplain or wetland does not indirectly impact floodplains or wetlands or support development therein (see § 9.10), the remaining analysis set out by this regulation is not required. If such location does indirectly impact floodplains or wetlands or support development therein, the remaining analysis set out by this regulation is required. If the preliminary determination is to act in the floodplain, FEMA shall gather the additional information required under Steps 4 and 5 and then reevaluate all the data to determine if the floodplain or wetland is the only practicable alternative.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Analysis of practicable alternatives.</E> The Agency shall identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to carrying out a proposed action in floodplains or wetlands, including:</P>
            <P>(1) Alternative sites outside the floodplain or wetland;</P>
            <P>(2) Alternative actions which serve essentially the same purpose as the proposed action, but which have less potential to affect or be affected by the floodplain or wetlands; and</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">No action.</E> The floodplain and wetland site itself must be a practicable location in light of the factors set out in this section.</P>
            <P>(c) The Agency shall analyze the following factors in determining the practicability of the alternatives set out in paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Natural environment (topography, habitat, hazards, etc.);</P>
            <P>(2) Social concerns (aesthetics, historical and cultural values, land patterns, etc.);</P>
            <P>(3) Economic aspects (costs of space, construction, services, and relocation); and</P>
            <P>(4) Legal constraints (deeds, leases, etc.).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Action following the analysis of practicable alternatives.</E> (1) The Agency shall not locate the proposed action in the floodplain or in a wetland if a practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland.</P>
            <P>(2) For critical actions, the Agency shall not locate the proposed action in the 500-year floodplain if a practicable alternative exists outside the 500-year floodplain.</P>
            <P>(3) Even if no practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland, in order to carry out the action the floodplain or wetland must itself be a practicable location in light of the review required in this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reevaluation of alternatives.</E> Upon determination of the impact of the proposed action to or within the floodplain or wetland and of what measures are necessary to comply with the requirement to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands (§ 9.11), FEMA shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine whether:</P>
            <P>(i) The action is still practicable at a floodplain or wetland site in light of the exposure to flood risk and the ensuing disruption of natural values;</P>
            <P>(ii) The floodplain or wetland site is the only practicable alternative;</P>
            <P>(iii) There is a potential for limiting the action to increase the practicability of previously rejected non-floodplain or wetland sites and alternative actions; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Minimization of harm to or within the floodplain can be achieved using all practicable means.</P>
            <P>(2) Take no action in a floodplain unless the importance of the floodplain site clearly outweighs the requirement of E.O. 11988 to:</P>
            <P>(i) Avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development;</P>
            <P>(ii) Reduce the risk of flood loss;</P>
            <P>(iii) Minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Restore and preserve floodplain values.</P>
            <P>(3) Take no action in a wetland unless the importance of the wetland site clearly outweighs the requirements of E.O. 11990 to:</P>

            <P>(i) Avoid the destruction or modification of the wetlands;<PRTPAGE P="65"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands;</P>

That is, even if there is no practicable alternative outside of the floodplain or wetland, the floodplain or wetland itself must be a practicable location in order for the action to be carried out there. To be a practicable location, the importance of carrying out the action must clearly outweigh the requirements of the Orders listed in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. Unless the importance of carrying out the action clearly outweighs those requirements, the “no action” alternative shall be selected.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Identify impacts of proposed actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this section is to ensure that the effects of proposed Agency actions are identified.</P>
            <P>(b) The Agency shall identify the potential direct and indirect adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and wetlands and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action. Such identification of impacts shall be to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of the Orders to avoid floodplain and wetland locations unless they are the only practicable alternatives and to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands.</P>
            <P>(c) This identification shall consider whether the proposed action will result in an increase in the useful life of any structure or facility in question, maintain the investment at risk and exposure of lives to the flood hazard or forego an opportunity to restore the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains or wetlands. Regional Offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may be contacted to aid in the identification and evaluation of potential impacts of the proposed action on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values.</P>
            <P>(d) In the review of a proposed or alternative action, the Regional Administrator shall specifically consider and evaluate: impacts associated with modification of wetlands and floodplains regardless of its location; additional impacts which may occur when certain types of actions may support subsequent action which have additional impacts of their own; adverse impacts of the proposed actions on lives and property and on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values; and the three categories of factors listed below:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Flood hazard-related factors.</E> These include for example, the factors listed in § 9.7(b)(2);</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Natural values-related factors.</E> These include, for example, the following: Water resource values (natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, and ground water recharge); living resource values (fish and wildlife and biological productivity); cultural resource values (archeological and historic sites, and open space recreation and green belts); and agricultural, aquacultural and forestry resource values.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Factors relevant to a proposed action's effects on the survival and quality of wetlands.</E> These include, for example, the following: Public health, safety, and welfare, including water supply, quality, recharge and discharge; pollution; flood and storm hazards; and sediment and erosion; maintenance of natural systems, including conservation <PRTPAGE P="66"/>and long term productivity of existing flora and fauna, species and habitat diversity and stability, hydrologic utility, fish, wildlife, timber, and food and fiber resources; and other uses of wetlands in the public interest, including recreational, scientific, and cultural uses.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Mitigation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this section is to expand upon the directives set out in § 9.6 of this part, and to set out the mitigative actions required if the preliminary determination is made to carry out an action that affects or is in a floodplain or wetland.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> (1) The Agency shall design or modify its actions so as to minimize harm to or within the floodplain;</P>
            <P>(2) The Agency shall minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands;</P>
            <P>(3) The Agency shall restore and preserve natural and beneficial floodplain values; and</P>
            <P>(4) The Agency shall preserve and enhance natural and beneficial wetland values.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimization provisions.</E> The Agency shall minimize:</P>
            <P>(1) Potential harm to lives and the investment at risk from the base flood, or, in the case of critical actions, from the 500-year flood;</P>
            <P>(2) Potential adverse impacts the action may have on others; and</P>
            <P>(3) Potential adverse impact the action may have on floodplain and wetland values.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Minimization Standards.</E> In its implementation of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, the Agency shall apply at a minimum, the following standards to its actions to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c), of this section, (except as provided in § 9.5 (c), (d), and (g) regarding categories of partial or total exclusion). Any Agency action to which the following specific requirements do not apply, shall nevertheless be subject to the full 8-step process (§ 9.6) including the general requirement to minimize harm to and within floodplains:</P>
            <P>(1) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement in a floodway, and no new construction in a coastal high hazard area, except for:</P>
            <P>(i) A functionally dependent use; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A structure or facility which facilitates an open space use.</P>
            <P>(2) For a structure which is a functionally dependent use, or which facilitates an open space use, the following applies. There shall be no construction of a new or substantially improved structure in a coastal high hazard area unless it is elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns, and securely anchored to such piles or columns so that the lowest portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level (the 500-year flood level for critical actions) (including wave height). The structure shall be anchored so as to withstand velocity waters and hurricane wave wash. The Regional Administrator shall be responsible for determining the base flood level, including the wave height, in all cases. Where there is a FIRM in effect, it shall be the basis of the Regional Administrator's determination. If the FIRM does not reflect wave heights, or if there is no FIRM in effect, the Regional Administrator is responsible for delineating the base flood level, including wave heights.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Elevation of structures.</E> (i) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement of structures unless the lowest floor of the structures (including basement) is at or above the level of the base flood.</P>
            <P>(ii) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement of structures involving a critical action unless the lowest floor of the structure (including the basement) is at or above the level of the 500-year flood.</P>

            <P>(iii) If the subject structure is nonresidential, FEMA may, instead of elevating the structure to the 100-year or 500-year level, as appropriate, approve the design of the structure and its attendant utility and sanitary facilities so that below the flood level the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iv) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section do not apply to the extent that the Federal Insurance Administration has granted an exception under 44 CFR § 60.6(b) (formerly 24 CFR 1910.6(b)), or the community has granted a variance which the Regional Administrator determines is consistent with 44 CFR 60.6(a) (formerly 24 CFR 1910.6(a)). In a community which does not have a FIRM in effect, FEMA may approve a variance from the standards of paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, after compliance with the standards of 44 CFR 60.6(a).</P>
            <P>(4) There shall be no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements of structures or facilities, or other development within a designated regulatory floodway that would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the base floodplain unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.</P>
            <P>(5) Even if an action is a functionally dependent use or facilitates open space uses (under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section) and does not increase flood heights (under paragraph (d)(4) of this section), such action may only be taken in a floodway or coastal high hazard area if:</P>
            <P>(i) Such site is the only practicable alternative; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Harm to and within the floodplain is minimized.</P>

            <P>(6) In addition to standards (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section, no action may be taken if it is inconsistent with the criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR part 59 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or any more restrictive Federal, State or local floodplain management standards.</P>
            <P>(7) New construction and substantial improvement of structures shall be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather than on fill, in all cases in coastal high hazard areas and elsewhere, where practicable.</P>
            <P>(8) To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and welfare, the Agency shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in floodplains into existing flood warning and preparedness plans and ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;</P>
            <P>(ii) Facilitate adequate access and egress to and from the site of the proposed action; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in flash flood, rapid-rise or tsunami areas.</P>
            <P>(9) In the replacement of building contents, materials and equipment, the Regional Administrator shall require as appropriate, disaster proofing of the building and/or elimination of such future losses by relocation of those building contents, materials and equipment outside or above the base floodplain or the 500-year floodplain for critical actions.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">In the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program.</E> (1) The Federal Insurance Administration shall make identification of all coastal high hazard areas a priority;</P>
            <P>(2) Beginning October 1, 1981, the Federal Insurance Administration of FEMA may only provide flood insurance for new construction or substantial improvements in a coastal high hazard area if:</P>
            <P>(i) Wave heights have been designated for the site of the structure either by the Administrator of FEMA based upon data generated by FEMA or by another source, satisfactory to the Administrator; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The structure is rated by FEMA-FIA based on a system which reflects the capacity to withstand the effects of the 100-year frequency flood including, but not limited to, the following factors:</P>
            <P>(A) Wave heights;</P>
            <P>(B) The ability of the structure to withstand the force of waves.</P>

            <P>(3)(i) FEMA shall accept and take fully into account information submitted by a property owner indicating that the rate for a particular structure is too high based on the ability of the <PRTPAGE P="68"/>structure to withstand the force of waves. In order to obtain a rate adjustment, a property owner must submit to FEMA specific information regarding the structure and its immediate environment. Such information must be certified by a registered professional architect or engineer who has demonstrable experience and competence in the fields of foundation, soils, and structural engineering. Such information should include:</P>
            <P>(A) Elevation of the structure (bottom of lowest floor beam) in relation to the Base Flood Elevation including wave height;</P>
            <P>(B) Distance of the structure from the shoreline;</P>
            <P>(C) Dune protection and other environmental factors;</P>
            <P>(D) Description of the building support system; and</P>
            <P>(E) Other relevant building details.</P>
            <FP>Adequate completion of the “V-Zone Risk Factor Rating Form” is sufficient for FEMA to determine whether a rate adjustment is appropriate. The form is available from and applications for rate adjustments should be submitted to:</FP>

FEMA shall not sell or otherwise dispose of mobile homes or other readily fabricated dwellings which would be located in floodplains or wetlands unless there is full compliance with the 8-step process. Given the vulnerability of mobile homes to flooding, a rejection of a non-floodplain location alternative and of the no-action alternative shall be based on (1) a compelling need of the family or individual to buy a mobile home for permanent housing, and (2) a compelling requirement to locate the unit in a floodplain. Further, FEMA shall not sell or otherwise dispose of mobile homes or other readily fabricated dwellings in a floodplain unless they are elevated at least to the level of the 100-year flood.

            <P>(5) Identify the steps necessary to minimize, restore, preserve and enhance in accordance with § 9.11. For disposals, this analysis shall address all four of these components of mitigation where unimproved property is involved, but shall focus on minimization through floodproofing and restoration of natural values where improved property is involved;</P>
            <P>(6) Reevaluate the proposal to dispose of the property in light of its exposure to the flood hazard and its natural values-related impacts, in accordance with § 9.9. This analysis shall focus on whether it is practicable in light of the findings from §§ 9.10 and 9.11 to dispose of the property, or whether it must be retained. If it is determined that it is practicable to dispose of the property, this analysis shall identify the practicable alternative that best achieves all of the components of the Orders' mitigation responsibility;</P>
            <P>(7) To the extent that it would decrease the flood hazard to lives and property, the Agency shall, wherever practicable, dispose of the properties according to the following priorities:</P>
            <P>(i) Properties located outside the floodplain;</P>
            <P>(ii) Properties located in the flood fringe; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Properties located in a floodway, regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard area.</P>
            <P>(8) The Agency shall prepare and provide the public with a finding and public explanation in accordance with § 9.12.</P>
            <P>(9) The Agency shall ensure that the applicable mitigation requirements are fully implemented in accordance with § 9.11.</P>
            <P>(c) At the time of disposal, for all disposed property, the Agency shall reference in the conveyance uses that are restricted under existing Federal, State and local floodplain management and wetland protection standards relating to flood hazards and floodplain and wetland values.</P>

              <P>(a) For the purpose of this part, and the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act a claim is deemed to have been presented when FEMA receives, at a place designated in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, an executed “Claim for Damage or Injury,” Standard Form 95, or other written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for injury to or loss of property, for personal injury, or for death alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident. A claim which should have been presented to FEMA, but which was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is deemed to be presented to FEMA as of the date that the claim is received by FEMA. If a claim is mistakenly addressed to or filed with FEMA, the claim shall forthwith be transferred to the appropriate Federal Agency, if ascertainable, or returned to the claimant.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a claimant shall mail or deliver his or her claim to the Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC, 20472.</P>
              <P>(c) When a claim is for $200 or less, does not involve a personal injury, and involves a FEMA regional employee, the claimant shall mail or deliver the claim to the Administrator of the FEMA Regional Office in which is employed the FEMA employee whose negligence or wrongful act or omission is alleged to have caused the loss or injury complained of. The addresses of the Regional Offices of FEMA are set out in part 2 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) A claim presented in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final FEMA action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). Amendments shall be submitted in writing and signed by the claimant or his or her duly authorized agent or legal representative. Upon the timely filing of an amendment to a pending claim, FEMA shall have six months in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) shall not accrue until six months after the filing of an amendment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope and purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3721 to settle and pay (including replacement in kind) claims of officers and employees of FEMA, amounting to not more than $25,000 for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. Property may be replaced in-kind at the option of the Government. Claims are payable only for such types, quantities, or amounts of tangible personal property (including money) as the approving authority shall determine to be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances existing at the time and place of the loss. In determining what is reasonable, useful, or proper, the approving authority will consider the type and quantity of property involved, circumstances attending acquisition and use of the property, and whether possession or use by the claimant at the time of damage or loss was incident to service.</P>

              <P>(b) The Government does not underwrite all personal property losses that a claimant may sustain and it does not underwrite individual tastes. While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made <PRTPAGE P="78"/>only to the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper. If individuals possess excessive quantities of items, or expensive items, they should have such property privately insured. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) A claim pursuant to this subpart may only be made by: (1) An employee of FEMA; (2) a former employee of FEMA whose claim arises out of an incident occurring before his/her separation from FEMA; (3) survivors of a person named in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, in the following order of precedence: (i) Spouse; (ii) children; (iii) father or mother, or both or (iv) brothers or sisters, or both; (4) the authorized agent or legal representative of a person named in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A claim may not be presented by or for the benefit of a subrogee, assignee, conditional vendor, or other third party.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Time limitations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A claim under this part may be allowed only if it is in writing, specifies a sum certain and is received in the Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472: (1) Within 2 years after it accrues; (2) or if it cannot be filed within the time limits of paragraph (a)(1) of this section because it accrues in time of war or in time of armed conflict in which any armed force of the United States is engaged or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after the claim accrues, when the claimant shows good cause, the claim may be filed within 2 years after the cause ceases to exist but not more than 2 years after termination of the war or armed conflict.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this subpart, a claim accrues at the time of the accident or incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage should have been discovered by the claimant by the exercise of due diligence.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 11.73</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Allowable claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A claim may be allowed only if: (1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, his/her agent, the members of his/her family, or his/her private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and (2) the possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and (3) the claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this subpart shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.</P>
              <P>(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with FEMA may be considered and allowed. The following are examples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed, unless excluded by § 11.74.</P>

              <P>(iv) When stolen from the quarters of the claimant where it is conclusively shown that the money was in a locked container and that the quarters themselves were locked. Exceptions to the foregoing “double lock” rule are permitted when the adjudicating authority determines that the theft loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, their agent, or their employee. The adjudicating authority should use the test of whether the claimant did their best under the circumstances to protect the property; or</P>
              <P>(v) When taken by force from the claimant's person.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Clothing.</E> Claims may be allowed for clothing and accessories customarily worn on the person which are damaged or lost:</P>

              <P>(8) <E T="03">Enemy action or public service.</E> Claims may be allowed for damage to or loss of property as a direct consequence of:</P>
              <P>(i) Enemy action or threat thereof, or combat, guerrilla, brigandage, or other belligerent activity, or unjust confiscation by a foreign power or its nation:</P>
              <P>(ii) Action by the claimant to quiet a civil disturbance or to alleviate a public disaster; or</P>

              <P>(B) The damage or loss resulted from a hostile act directed against the Government or its officers, or employees.</P>
              <P>(ii) On paying the claim under this section, the Government is subrogated for the amount of the payment to a right or claim that the claimant may have against the foreign country for the damage or loss for which the Government made the payment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Claims involving carriers and insurers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In the event the property which is the subject of a claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost, or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) If more than one bill of lading or contract was issued, a separate demand should be made against the last carrier on each such document.</P>
              <P>(2) The demand should be made within the time limit provided in the policy and prior to the filing of a claim against the Government.</P>
              <P>(3) If it is apparent that the damage or loss is attributable to packing, storage, or unpacking while in the custody of the Government, no demand need be made against the carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever property which is damaged, lost, or destroyed incident to the claimant's service is insured in whole or in part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the concurrent claim against the Government.</P>
              <P>(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from the carrier or insurer, had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution, or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.</P>
              <P>(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit a claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final approval or denial of the claim is made by the carrier or insurer.</P>

              <P>(1) Upon submission of a claim to the Government, the claimant must certify in the claim that no recovery (or the amount of recovery) has been gained from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If the carrier or insurer has not taken final action on the claim against them, by the time the claimant submits a claim to the Government, the claimant will immediately notify them to address all correspondence in regard to the claim to him/her, in care of the Chief Counsel of FEMA.</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant shall timely advise the Chief Counsel in writing, of any action which is taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim. On request, the claimant also will furnish such evidence as may be required to enable the United States to enforce the claim.</P>

After payment of the claim by the Government, the claimant will, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by the claimant from the United States.</P>
              <P>(f) When a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before the claim against the Government under this subpart is settled, the amount or recovery shall be applied to the claim as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this subpart, no compensation is allowable under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of such total loss;</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f) the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the $25,000 maximum set forth above. However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds $25,000, the claimant will be allowed only $25,000.</P>

They supersede provisions of State law, however, that Federal law makes criminal offenses under the Assimilated Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 13) to the extent that State laws conflict with these regulations. State and local criminal laws apply as such only to the extent that the State reserved such authority to itself by the State consent or cession statute or that a Federal statute vests such authority in the State.</P>

            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 16.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 16.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 16.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—<PRTPAGE P="93"/>

            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>

            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 16.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

              <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence <PRTPAGE P="99"/>made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>

              <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances.

However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.

              <SUBJECT>Description of program.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 was enacted by title XIII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of <PRTPAGE P="132"/>1968 (Pub. L. 90-448, August 1, 1968) to provide previously unavailable flood insurance protection to property owners in flood-prone areas. Mudslide (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969). Flood-related erosion (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, December 31, 1973). The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 requires the purchase of flood insurance on and after March 2, 1974, as a condition of receiving any form of Federal or federally-related financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes with respect to insurable buildings and mobile homes within an identified special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard area that is located within any community participating in the Program. The Act also requires that on and after July 1, 1975, or one year after a community has been formally notified by the Federal Insurance Administrator. of its identification as community containing one or more special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard areas, no such Federal financial assistance, shall be provided within such an area unless the community in which the area is located is then participating in the Program, subject to certain exceptions. See FIA published Guidelines at § 59.4(c).</P>
              <P>(b) To qualify for the sale of federally-subsidized flood insurance a community must adopt and submit to the Federal Insurance Administrator. as part of its application, flood plain management regulations, satisfying at a minimum the criteria set forth at part 60 of this subchapter, designed to reduce or avoid future flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion damages. These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) Minimum requirements for adequate flood plain management regulations are set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, in § 60.4 for mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas and in § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas. Those applicable requirements and standards are based on the amount of technical information available to the community.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emergency program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The 1968 Act required a risk study to be undertaken for each community before it could become eligible for the sale of flood insurance. Since this requirement resulted in a delay in providing insurance, the Congress, in section 408 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969), established an Emergency Flood Insurance Program as a new section 1336 of the National Flood Insurance Act (42 U.S.C. 4056) to permit the early sale of insurance in flood-prone communities. The emergency program does not affect the requirement that a community must adopt adequate flood plain management regulations pursuant to part 60 of this subchapter but permits insurance to be sold before a study is conducted to determine risk premium rates for the community. The program still requires upon the effective date of a FIRM the charging of risk premium rates for all new construction and substantial improvements and for higher limits of coverage for existing structures.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension of community eligibility.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance shall be subject to suspension from the Program for failing to submit copies of adequate flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of § 60.3 or paragraph (b) of § 60.4 or § 60.5, within six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data upon which the flood plain regulations for the applicable paragraph shall be based. Where there has not been any submission by the community, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community that 90 days remain in the six month period in order to submit adequate flood plain management regulations. Where there has been an inadequate submission, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community of the specific deficiencies in its submitted flood plain management regulations and inform the community of the amount of time remaining within the six month period. If, subsequently, copies of adequate flood plain management regulations are not received by the Federal Insurance Administrator, no later than 30 days before the expiration of the original six month period the Federal Insurance Administrator shall provide written notice to the community and to the state and assure publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under part 64 of this subchapter of the community's loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance, such suspension to become effective upon the expiration of the six month period. Should the community remedy the defect and the Federal Insurance Administrator receive copies of adequate flood plain management regulations within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the Federal Insurance Administrator. If the Federal Insurance Administrator receives notice from the State that it has enacted adequate flood plain management regulations for the community within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the Federal Insurance Administrator. The community's eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</P>

              <P>(b) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be subject to probation. Probation shall represent formal notification to the community that the Federal Insurance Administrator regards the community's flood plain management program as not compliant with NFIP criteria. Prior to imposing probation, the Federal Insurance Administrator (1) shall inform the community upon 90 days prior written notice of the impending probation and of the specific program deficiencies and violations relative to the failure to enforce, (2) shall, at least 60 days before probation is to begin, issue a press release to local media explaining the reasons for and the effects of probation, and (3) shall, at least 90 days before probation is to begin, advise all policyholders in the community of the impending probation and the additional premium that will be charged, as provided in this paragraph, on policies sold or renewed during the period of <PRTPAGE P="136"/>probation. During this 90-day period the community shall have the opportunity to avoid probation by demonstrating compliance with Program requirements, or by correcting Program deficiencies and remedying all violations to the maximum extent possible. If, at the end of the 90-day period, the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that the community has failed to do so, the probation shall go into effect. Probation may be continued for up to one year after the community corrects all Program deficiencies and remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible. Flood insurance may be sold or renewed in the community while it is on probation. Where a policy covers property located in a community placed on probation on or after October 1, 1986, but prior to October 1, 1992, an additional premium of $25.00 shall be charged on each such policy newly issued or renewed during the one-year period beginning on the date the community is placed on probation and during any successive one-year periods that begin prior to October 1, 1992. Where a community's probation begins on or after October 1, 1992, the additional premium described in the preceding sentence shall be $50.00, which shall also be charged during any successive one-year periods during which the community remains on probation for any part thereof. This $50.00 additional premium shall further be charged during any successive one-year periods that begin on or after October 1, 1992, where the preceding one-year probation period began prior to October 1, 1992.</P>

              <P>(c) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce its flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 and does not correct its Program deficiencies and remedy all violations to the maximum extent possible in accordance with compliance deadlines established during a period of probation shall be subject to suspension of its Program eligibility. Under such circumstances, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall grant the community 30 days in which to show cause why it should not be suspended. The Federal Insurance Administrator may conduct a hearing, written or oral, before commencing suspensive action. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under part 64 of this subchapter of its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance. In the event of impending suspension, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall issue a press release to the local media explaining the reasons and effects of the suspension. The community's eligibility shall only be reinstated by the Federal Insurance Administrator upon his receipt of a local legislative or executive measure reaffirming the community's formal intent to adequately enforce the flood plain management requirements of this subpart, together with evidence of action taken by the community to correct Program deficiencies and remedy to the maximum extent possible those violations which caused the suspension. In certain cases, the Federal Insurance Administrator, in order to evaluate the community's performance under the terms of its submission, may withhold reinstatement for a period not to exceed one year from the date of his receipt of the satisfactory submission or place the community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which repeals its flood plain management regulations, allows its regulations to lapse, or amends its regulations so that they no longer meet the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be suspended from the Program. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under part 64 of this subchapter of its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance. The community eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</P>

              <P>(e) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance may withdraw from <PRTPAGE P="137"/>the Program by submitting to the Federal Insurance Administrator a copy of a legislative action that explicitly states its desire to withdraw from the National Flood Insurance Program. Upon receipt of a certified copy of a final legislative action, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall withdraw the community from the Program and publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under part 64 of this subchapter its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance. A community that has withdrawn from the Program may be reinstated if its submits the application materials specified in § 59.22(a).</P>
              <P>(f) If during a period of ineligibility under paragraphs (a), (d), or (e) of this section, a community has permitted actions to take place that have aggravated existing flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood related erosion hazards, the Federal Insurance Administrator may withhold reinstatement until the community submits evidence that it has taken action to remedy to the maximum extent possible the increased hazards. The Federal Insurance Administrator may also place the reinstated community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall promptly notify the servicing company and any insurers issuing flood insurance pursuant to an arrangement with the Federal Insurance Administrator of those communities whose eligibility has been suspended or which have withdrawn from the program. Flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed in those communities. Policies sold or renewed within a community during a period of ineligibility are deemed to be voidable by the Federal Insurance Administrator whether or not the parties to sale or renewal had actual notice of the ineligibility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose of subpart.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Act provides that flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed under <PRTPAGE P="138"/>the program within a community, unless the community has adopted adequate flood plain management regulations consistent with Federal criteria. Responsibility for establishing such criteria is delegated to the Federal Insurance Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart sets forth the criteria developed in accordance with the Act by which the Federal Insurance Administrator will determine the adequacy of a community's flood plain management regulations. These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that the regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances or codes. Except as otherwise provided in § 60.6, the adequacy of such regulations shall be determined on the basis of the standards set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, § 60.4 for mudslide areas and § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas.</P>
              <P>(c) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as modifying or replacing the general requirement that all eligible communities must take into account flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use.</P>
              <P>(d) The criteria set forth in this subpart are minimum standards for the adoption of flood plain management regulations by flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone and flood-related erosion-prone communities. Any community may exceed the minimum criteria under this part by adopting more comprehensive flood plain management regulations utilizing the standards such as contained in subpart C of this part. In some instances, community officials may have access to information or knowledge of conditions that require, particularly for human safety, higher standards than the minimum criteria set forth in subpart A of this part. Therefore, any flood plain management regulations adopted by a State or a community which are more restrictive than the criteria set forth in this part are encouraged and shall take precedence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Minimum compliance with flood plain management criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A flood-prone community applying for flood insurance eligibility shall meet the standards of § 60.3(a) in order to become eligible if a FHBM has not been issued for the community at the time of application. Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data set forth in § 60.3 (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), in which to meet the requirements of the applicable paragraph. If a community has received a FHBM, but has not yet applied for Program eligibility, the community shall apply for eligibility directly under the standards set forth in § 60.3(b). Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data set forth in § 60.3 (c), (d), (e) or (f) in which to meet the requirements of the applicable paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) A mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone community applying for flood insurance eligibility shall meet the standards of § 60.4(a) to become eligible. Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas having special mudslide hazards are delineated in which to meet the requirements of § 60.4(b).</P>
              <P>(c) A flood-related erosion-prone community applying for flood insurance eligibility shall meet the standards of § 60.5(a) to become eligible. Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the flood-related erosion areas having special erosion hazards are delineated in which to meet the requirements of § 60.5(b).</P>

              <P>(d) Communities identified in part 65 of this subchapter as containing more than one type of hazard (e.g., any combination of special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion hazard areas) shall adopt flood plain management regulations for each type <PRTPAGE P="139"/>of hazard consistent with the requirements of §§ 60.3, 60.4 and 60.5.</P>
              <P>(e) Local flood plain management regulations may be submitted to the State Coordinating Agency designated pursuant to § 60.25 for its advice and concurrence. The submission to the State shall clearly describe proposed enforcement procedures.</P>
              <P>(f) The community official responsible for submitting annual or biennial reports to the Federal Insurance Administrator pursuant to § 59.22(b)(2) of this subchapter shall also submit copies of each annual or biennial report to any State Coordinating Agency.</P>
              <P>(g) A community shall assure that its comprehensive plan is consistent with the flood plain management objectives of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) The community shall adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations based on data provided by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Without prior approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator, the community shall not adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations based upon modified data reflecting natural or man-made physical changes.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Flood plain management criteria for flood-prone areas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood hazard area designations and water surface elevations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special flood hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases the minimum requirements governing the adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data formally provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not defined the special flood hazard areas within a community, has not provided water surface elevation data, and has not provided sufficient data to identify the floodway or coastal high hazard area, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community, including the placement of manufactured homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas;</P>
              <P>(2) Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;</P>

              <P>(3) Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall (i) be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, (iii) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and (iv) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.<PRTPAGE P="140"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Review subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to assure that (i) all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area, (ii) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (iii) adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;</P>
              <P>(5) Require within flood-prone areas new and replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and</P>
              <P>(6) Require within flood-prone areas (i) new and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and (ii) onsite waste disposal systems to be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.</P>
              <P>(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has designated areas of special flood hazards (A zones) by the publication of a community's FHBM or FIRM, but has neither produced water surface elevation data nor identified a floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Require permits for all proposed construction and other developments including the placement of manufactured homes, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;</P>
              <P>(2) Require the application of the standards in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section to development within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;</P>
              <P>(3) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data;</P>
              <P>(4) Obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, including data developed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM meet the standards in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(5), (c)(6), (c)(12), (c)(14), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(5) Where base flood elevation data are utilized, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM:</P>
              <P>(i) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Obtain, if the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Maintain a record of all such information with the official designated by the community under § 59.22 (a)(9)(iii);</P>
              <P>(6) Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to the Federal Insurance Administrator;</P>
              <P>(7) Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;</P>
              <P>(8) Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.</P>

              <P>(c) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final flood elevations for one or more <PRTPAGE P="141"/>special flood hazard areas on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated other special flood hazard areas without base flood elevations on the community's FIRM, but has not identified a regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Require the standards of paragraph (b) of this section within all A1-30 zones, AE zones, A zones, AH zones, and AO zones, on the community's FIRM;</P>
              <P>(2) Require that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level, unless the community is granted an exception by the Federal Insurance Administrator for the allowance of basements in accordance with § 60.6 (b) or (c);</P>
              <P>(3) Require that all new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the community's firm (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;</P>
              <P>(4) Provide that where a non-residential structure is intended to be made watertight below the base flood level, (i) a registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (c)(8)(ii) of this section, and (ii) a record of such certificates which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained with the official designated by the community under § 59.22(a)(9)(iii);</P>
              <P>(5) Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.</P>
              <P>(6) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites</P>
              <P>(i) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,</P>
              <P>(ii) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,</P>
              <P>(iii) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or</P>
              <P>(iv) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation collapse and lateral movement.</P>

              <P>(7) Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);<PRTPAGE P="142"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level to meet the floodproofing standard specified in § 60.3(c)(3)(ii);</P>
              <P>(9) Require within any A99 zones on a community's FIRM the standards of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4)(i) and (b)(5) through (b)(9) of this section;</P>
              <P>(10) Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.</P>

              <P>(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) through (14) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) Select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point;</P>

              <P>(3) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory <PRTPAGE P="143"/>floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 60.3, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.</P>

For the purposes of this section, a breakway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and,</P>

              <P>(ii) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural).

              <P>The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard area designations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases, the minimum requirements for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not yet identified any area within the community as an area having special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall</P>
              <P>(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community so that it may determine whether development is proposed within mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas;</P>
              <P>(2) Require review of each permit application to determine whether the proposed site and improvements will be reasonably safe from mudslides (i.e., mudflows). Factors to be considered in making such a determination should include but not be limited to (i) the type and quality of soils, (ii) any evidence of ground water or surface water problems, (iii) the depth and quality of any fill, (iv) the overall slope of the site, and (v) the weight that any proposed structure will impose on the slope;</P>
              <P>(3) Require, if a proposed site and improvements are in a location that may have mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards, that (i) a site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering, (ii) the proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvements are adequately designed and protected against mudslide (i.e., mudflow) damages, (iii) the proposed grading, excavations, new construction and substantial improvements do not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances, and (iv) drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance be such as not to endanger slope stability.</P>
              <P>(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated Zone M on the community's FIRM, the community shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(2) Adopt and enforce a grading ordinance or regulation in accordance with data supplied by the Federal Insurance Administrator which (i) regulates the location of foundation systems and utility systems of new construction and substantial improvements, (ii) regulates the location, drainage and maintenance of all excavations, cuts and fills and planted slopes, (iii) provides special requirements for protective measures including but not necessarily limited to retaining walls, buttress fills, sub-drains, diverter terraces, <PRTPAGE P="146"/>benchings, etc., and (iv) requires engineering drawings and specifications to be submitted for all corrective measures, accompanied by supporting soils engineering and geology reports.

              <P>The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations for flood-related erosion-prone areas shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources, pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood-related erosion hazard area designations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator they shall apply.

In all cases the minimum requirements governing the adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-related erosion-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not yet identified any area within the community as having special flood-related erosion hazards, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall</P>
              <P>(1) Require the issuance of a permit for all proposed construction, or other development in the area of flood-related erosion hazard, as it is known to the community;</P>
              <P>(2) Require review of each permit application to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing flood-related erosion hazard; and</P>
              <P>(3) If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or to increase the erosion hazard, require the improvement to be relocated or adequate protective measures to be taken which will not aggravate the existing erosion hazard.</P>
              <P>(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated Zone E on the community's FIRM, the community shall</P>
              <P>(1) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) Require a setback for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water, to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer will be designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in conjunction with the anticipated “useful life” of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic and climatic characteristics of the community's land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Variances and exceptions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator does not set forth absolute criteria for granting variances from the criteria set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4, and 60.5. The issuance of a variance is for flood plain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by <PRTPAGE P="147"/>the granting of a variance. The community, after examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or disapprove a request. While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre (as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. The Federal Insurance Administrator may review a community's findings justifying the granting of variances, and if that review indicates a pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood plain management, the Federal Insurance Administrator may take appropriate action under § 59.24(b) of this subchapter. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. Procedures for the granting of variances by a community are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;</P>
              <P>(2) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the procedures of paragraphs (a) (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section;</P>
              <P>(3) Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;</P>
              <P>(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;</P>
              <P>(5) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (i) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in paragraph (a)(6) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(6) A community shall (i) maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.</P>
              <P>(7) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) The requirement that each flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone, and flood-related erosion prone community must adopt and submit adequate flood plain management regulations as a condition of initial and continued flood insurance eligibility is statutory and cannot be waived, and such regulations shall be adopted by a community within the time periods specified in §§ 60.3, 60.4 or § 60.5. However, certain exceptions from the standards contained in this subpart may be permitted where the Federal Insurance Administrator recognizes that, because of extraordinary circumstances, local conditions may render the application of certain standards the cause for severe hardship and gross inequity for a particular community. Consequently, a community proposing the adoption of flood plain management regulations which vary from <PRTPAGE P="148"/>the standards set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4, or § 60.5, shall explain in writing to the Federal Insurance Administrator the nature and extent of and the reasons for the exception request and shall include sufficient supporting economic, environmental, topographic, hydrologic, and other scientific and technical data, and data with respect to the impact on public safety and the environment.</P>
              <P>(2) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall prepare a Special Environmental Clearance to determine whether the proposal for an exception under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will have significant impact on the human environment. The decision whether an Environmental Impact Statement or other environmental document will be prepared, will be made in accordance with applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy. Ninety or more days may be required for an environmental quality clearance if the proposed exception will have significant impact on the human environment thereby requiring an EIS.</P>
              <P>(c) A community may propose flood plain management measures which adopt standards for floodproofed residential basements below the base flood level in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE which are not subject to tidal flooding. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section the Federal Insurance Administrator may approve the proposal provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The community has demonstrated that areas of special flood hazard in which basements will be permitted are subject to shallow and low velocity flooding and that there is adequate flood warning time to ensure that all residents are notified of impending floods. For the purposes of this paragraph flood characteristics must include:</P>
              <P>(i) Flood depths that are five feet or less for developable lots that are contiguous to land above the base flood level and three feet or less for other lots;</P>
              <P>(ii) Flood velocities that are five feet per second or less; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Flood warning times that are 12 hours or greater. Flood warning times of two hours or greater may be approved if the community demonstrates that it has a flood warning system and emergency plan in operation that is adequate to ensure safe evacuation of flood plain residents.</P>
              <P>(2) The community has adopted flood plain management measures that require that new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures with basements in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Be designed and built so that any basement area, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities below the floodproofed design level, is watertight with walls that are impermeable to the passage of water without human intervention. Basement walls shall be built with the capacity to resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy resulting from flooding to the floodproofed design level, and shall be designed so that minimal damage will occur from floods that exceed that level. The floodproofed design level shall be an elevation one foot above the level of the base flood where the difference between the base flood and the 500-year flood is three feet or less and two feet above the level of the base flood where the difference is greater than three feet.</P>
              <P>(ii) Have the top of the floor of any basement area no lower than five feet below the elevation of the base flood;</P>
              <P>(iii) Have the area surrounding the structure on all sides filled to or above the elevation of the base flood. Fill must be compacted with slopes protected by vegetative cover;</P>

              <P>(9) Improvement of local drainage to control increased runoff that might increase the danger of flooding to other properties;</P>
              <P>(10) Coordination of plans with neighboring community's flood plain management programs;</P>
              <P>(11) The requirement that all new construction and substantial improvements in areas subject to subsidence be elevated above the base flood level equal to expected subsidence for at least a ten year period;</P>
              <P>(12) For riverine areas, requiring subdividers to furnish delineations for floodways before approving a subdivision;</P>
              <P>(13) Prohibition of any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, except as part of an overall drainage basin plan. In the event of an overall drainage basin plan, provide that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained;</P>
              <P>(14) Requirement of setbacks for new construction within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on a community's FIRM;</P>

              <P>(15) Requirement of additional elevation above the base flood level for all new construction and substantial improvements within Zones A1-30, AE, V1-30, and VE on the community's FIRM to protect against such occurrences as wave wash and floating debris, to provide an added margin of <PRTPAGE P="151"/>safety against floods having a magnitude greater than the base flood, or to compensate for future urban development;</P>
              <P>(16) Requirement of consistency between state, regional and local comprehensive plans and flood plain management programs;</P>
              <P>(17) Requirement of pilings or columns rather than fill, for the elevation of structures within flood-prone areas, in order to maintain the storage capacity of the flood plain and to minimize the potential for negative impacts to sensitive ecological areas;</P>
              <P>(18) Prohibition, within any floodway or coastal high hazard area, of plants or facilities in which hazardous substances are manufactured.</P>

            <P>This part describes the types of properties eligible for flood insurance coverage under the Program, the limits of such coverage, and the premium rates actually to be paid by insureds. The <PRTPAGE P="154"/>specific communities eligible for coverage are designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator from time to time as applications are approved under the emergency program and as ratemaking studies of communities are completed prior to the regular program. Lists of such communities are periodically published under part 64 of this subchapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special terms and conditions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) No new flood insurance or renewal of flood insurance policies shall be written for properties declared by a duly constituted State or local zoning or other authority to be in violation of any flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion area management or control law, regulation, or ordinance.</P>
            <P>(b) In order to reduce the administrative costs of the Program, of which the Federal Government pays a major share, payment of the full policyholder premium must be made at the time of application.</P>
            <P>(c) Because of the seasonal nature of flooding, refunds of premiums upon cancellation of coverage by the insured are permitted only if the insurer ceases to have an ownership interest in the covered property at the location described in the policy. Refunds of premiums for any other reason are subject to the conditions set forth in § 62.5 of this subchapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Risk premium rate determinations.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Pursuant to section 1307 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator is authorized to undertake studies and investigations to enable him/her to estimate the risk premium rates necessary to provide flood insurance in accordance with accepted actuarial principles, including applicable operating costs and allowances. Such rates <PRTPAGE P="156"/>are also referred to in this subchapter as “actuarial rates.”</P>
            <P>(b) The Federal Insurance Administrator is also authorized to prescribe by regulation the rates which can reasonably be charged to insureds in order to encourage them to purchase the flood insurance made available under the Program. Such rates are referred to in this subchapter as “chargeable rates.” For areas having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion hazards, chargeable rates are usually lower than actuarial rates.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Effective date and time of coverage under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy—New Business Applications and Endorsements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) During the 13-month period beginning on the effective date of a revised Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map for a community, the effective date and time of any initial flood insurance coverage shall be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the first calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium; for example, a flood insurance policy applied for with the payment of the premium on May 1 will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on May 2.</P>
            <P>(b) Where the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the making, increasing, extension, or renewal of a loan, the coverage with respect to the property which is the subject of the loan shall be effective as of the time of the loan closing, provided the written request for the coverage is received by the NFIP and the flood insurance policy is applied for and the presentment of payment of premium is made at or prior to the loan closing.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the effective date and time of any new policy or added coverage or increase in the amount of coverage shall be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the 30th calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium; for example, a flood insurance policy applied for with the payment of the premium on May 1 will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on May 31.</P>
            <P>(d) Adding new coverage or increasing the amount of coverage in force is permitted during the term of any policy. The additional premium for any new coverage or increase in the amount of coverage shall be calculated pro rata in accordance with the rates currently in force.</P>

            <P>(e) With respect to any submission of an application in connection with new business, the payment by an insured to an agent or the issuance of premium payment by the agent, does not constitute payment to the NFIP, except where a WYO Company receives an application and premium payment from one of its agents and elects to refer the business to the NFIP Servicing Agent because the WYO Company does not wish to write the business, in which case any applicable waiting period under this section shall be calculated in accordance with the first sentence of paragraph (f) of this section. Therefore, it is important that an application for Flood Insurance and its premium be mailed to the NFIP promptly in order to have the effective date of the coverage based on the application date plus the waiting period. If the application and the premium payment are received at the office of the NFIP within ten (10) days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application. Also, as an alternative, in those cases where the application and premium payment are mailed by certified mail within four (4) days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application even though the application and premium payment are received at the office of the NFIP after ten (10) days following the date of application. Thus, if the application and premium payment are received after ten (10) days from the date of the application or are not mailed by certified mail within four (4) days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of receipt at the office of the NFIP. To determine the effective date of any coverage added by endorsement to a flood insurance policy already in effect, substitute the term <E T="03">endorsement</E> for the term <E T="03">application</E> in this paragraph (e).</P>

            <P>(f) With respect to the submission of an application in connection with new business, a renewal of a policy in effect and an endorsement to a policy in effect, the payment by an insured to an agent or the issuance of premium payment to a Write-Your-Own (WYO) Company by the agent, accompanied by a properly completed application, renewal or endorsement form, as appropriate, shall commence the calculation of any applicable waiting period under <PRTPAGE P="158"/>this section, provided that the agent is acting in the capacity of an agent of a Write-Your-Own (WYO) Company authorized by 44 CFR 62.23, is under written contract to or is an employee of such Company, and such WYO Company is, at the time of such submission of an application in connection with new business or a renewal of or endorsement to flood insurance coverage, engaged in WYO business under an arrangement entered into by the Federal Insurance Administrator and the WYO Company pursuant to § 62.23.</P>
            <P>(g) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, the rules set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section apply to WYO Companies, except that premium payments and accompanying applications and endorsements shall be mailed to and received by the WYO Company, rather than the NFIP.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Rates based on a flood protection system involving Federal funds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a community has made adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system involving Federal funds which will significantly limit the area of special flood hazards, the applicable risk premium rates for any property, located within a special flood hazard area intended to be protected directly by such system will be those risk premium rates which would be applicable when the system is complete.</P>
            <P>(b) Adequate progress in paragraph (a) of this section means that the community has provided information to the Federal Insurance Administrator sufficient to determine that substantial completion of the flood protection system has been effected because:</P>
            <P>(1) 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been authorized;</P>
            <P>(2) At least 60 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been appropriated;</P>
            <P>(3) At least 50 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been expended;</P>
            <P>(4) All critical features of the flood protection system, as identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator, are under construction, and each critical feature is 50 percent completed as measured by the actual expenditure of the estimated construction budget funds; and</P>
            <P>(5) The community has not been responsible for any delay in the completion of the system.</P>

            <P>(c) Each request by a community for a determination must be submitted in writing to the Risk Analysis Division, Mitigation Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington DC, and contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the flood protection system, including, but not limited to, supporting technical data (e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood protection project data), cost schedules, budget appropriation data and the extent of Federal funding of the system's construction. Such facts shall include information sufficient to identify all persons affected by such flood protection system or by such request: A full and precise statement of intended purposes of the flood protection system; and a carefully detailed description of such project, including construction completion target dates. In addition, true copies of all contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents involved must be submitted with the request. Relevant facts reflected in documents, however, must be included in the statement and not merely incorporated by reference, and must be accompanied by an analysis of their bearing on the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, specifying the pertinent provisions. The request must contain a statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the person responsible for preparing the application for the community, the flood protection system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency, and the purpose of that litigation. <PRTPAGE P="159"/>The request must also contain a statement as to whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from the Federal Insurance Administrator, detailing the disposition of such previous request. As documents become part of the file and cannot be returned, the original documents should not be submitted.</P>
            <P>(d) The effective date for any risk premium rates established under this section shall be the date of final determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator that adequate progress toward completion of a flood protection system has been made in a community.</P>
            <P>(e) A responsible official of a community which received a determination that adequate progress has been made towards completion of a flood protection system shall certify to the Federal Insurance Administrator annually on the anniversary date of receipt of such determination that no present delay in completion of the system is attributable to local sponsors of the system, and that a good faith effort is being made to complete the project.</P>
            <P>(f) A community for which risk premium rates have been made available under section 1307(e) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator if, at any time, all progress on the completion of the flood protection system has been halted or if the project for the completion of the flood protection system has been canceled.</P>

            <P>(a) A Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) is a policy covering all individuals named by a State as recipients under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174) of an Individuals and Households Program (IHP) award for flood damage as a result of major disaster declaration by the President.</P>
            <P>(b) The premium for the GFIP is a flat fee of $600 per insured. We may adjust the premium to reflect NFIP loss experience and any adjustment of benefits under the IHP program.</P>
            <P>(c) The amount of coverage is equivalent to the maximum grant amount established under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174).</P>
            <P>(d) The term of the GFIP is for 36 months and begins 60 days after the date of the disaster declaration.</P>
            <P>(e) Coverage for individual grantees begins on the thirtieth day after the NFIP receives the required data for individual grantees and their premium payments.</P>
            <P>(f) We will send a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each individual insured under the GFIP.</P>

            <P>3. A detached garage at the described location. Coverage is limited to no more than 10% of the limit of liability on the dwelling. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the building limit of liability.

            <P>a. The property is owned by you or your household family members; and</P>
            <P>b. At your option, the property is owned by guests or servants.</P>

            <P>Personal property in a building that is not fully enclosed must be secured to prevent flotation out of the building. If the personal <PRTPAGE P="164"/>property does float out during a flood, it will be conclusively presumed that it was not reasonably secured. In that case there is no coverage for such property.</P>
            <P>2. Coverage for personal property includes the following property, subject to B.1. above, which is covered under Coverage B only:</P>
            <P>a. Air conditioning units, portable or window type;</P>

            <P>a. Air conditioning units, portable or window type;</P>
            <P>b. Clothes washers and dryers; and</P>

            <P>4. If you are a tenant and have insured personal property under Coverage B in this policy, we will cover such property, including your cooking stove or range and refrigerator. The policy will also cover improvements made or acquired solely at your expense in the dwelling or apartment in which you reside, but for not more than 10% of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit of liability.</P>
            <P>5. If you are the owner of a unit and have insured personal property under Coverage B in this policy, we will also cover your interior walls, floor, and ceiling (not otherwise covered under a flood insurance policy purchased by your condominium association) for not more than 10% of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit of liability.</P>

            <P>(2) This coverage for Sandbags, Supplies and Labor only applies if damage to insured property by or from flood is imminent and the threat of flood damage is apparent enough to lead a person of common prudence to anticipate flood damage. One of the following must also occur:</P>

            <P>Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.</P>

            <P>(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property, in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there. The personal property that is moved must be <PRTPAGE P="165"/>placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.</P>
            <P>Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b.and c., must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.</P>

            </P>
            <P>a. If this policy insures a unit, we will pay, up to the Coverage A limit of liability, your share of loss assessments charged against you by the condominium association in accordance with the condominium association's articles of association, declarations and your deed.</P>
            <P>The assessment must be made as a result of direct physical loss by or from flood during the policy term, to the building's common elements.</P>
            <P>b. We will not pay any loss assessment charged against you:</P>
            <P>(1) And the condominium association by any governmental body;</P>
            <P>(2) That results from a deductible under the insurance purchased by the condominium association insuring common elements;</P>
            <P>(3) That results from a loss to personal property, including contents of a condominium building;</P>
            <P>(4) That results from a loss sustained by the condominium association that was not reimbursed under a flood insurance policy written in the name of the association under the Act because the building was not, at the time of loss, insured for an amount equal to the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(a) 80% or more of its full replacement cost; or</P>
            <P>(b) The maximum amount of insurance permitted under the Act;</P>
            <P>(5) To the extent that payment under this policy for a condominium building loss, in combination with payments under any other NFIP policies for the same building loss, exceeds the maximum amount of insurance permitted under the Act for that kind of building; or</P>
            <P>(6) To the extent that payment under this policy for a condominium building loss, in combination with any recovery available to you as a tenant in common under any NFIP condominium association policies for the same building loss, exceeds the amount of insurance permitted under the Act for a single-family dwelling.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E>
            </P>
            <P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a structure suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your structure. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:</P>
            <P>a. Non-residential structures.</P>
            <P>b. Residential structures with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or (c)].</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Limit of Liability.</E>
            </P>
            <P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A—Building Property and Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Eligibility</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. A structure covered under Coverage A—Building Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss structure.” A repetitive loss structure is one that meets the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(a) The structure is covered by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.</P>
            <P>(b) The structure has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</P>
            <P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the time of each flood loss.</P>
            <P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the structure; or</P>
            <P>(2) Be a structure that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the structure.</P>
            <P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) 3.a.(1) above.</P>

            <P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood <PRTPAGE P="166"/>elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged structures in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged structure must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged structures to elevations derived solely by the community.</P>

            <P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “freeboard” requirements, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> that a structure must be elevated above the base flood elevation.</P>
            <P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of structures in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</P>
            <P>d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a structure during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g. below.</P>
            <P>e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-damaged structure into compliance with state or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the structure had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Conditions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. When a structure covered under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</P>
            <P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P>

            <P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.</P>
            <P>c. The loss in value to any insured building or other structure due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</P>
            <P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P>
            <P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</P>
            <P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and</P>
            <P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.</P>
            <P>f. Any code upgrade requirements, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P>
            <P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</P>
            <P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.</P>
            <P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.</P>
            <P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</P>
            <P>k. Any structure insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</P>
            <P>l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P>

              <PRTPAGE P="167"/>
            </P>
            <P>a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the 80% insurance-to-value requirement for replacement cost coverage as set forth in VII. General Conditions, V. Loss Settlement.</P>
            <P>b. All other conditions and provisions of the policy apply.</P>

            <P>a. If the property is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on the policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred; or</P>
            <P>b. If the property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Other Insurance</HD>

            <P>1. If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or <PRTPAGE P="169"/>destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:</P>
            <P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. immediately below applies.</P>
            <P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.</P>

When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.</P>
            <P>2. If there is other insurance in the name of your condominium association covering the same property covered by this policy, then this policy will be in excess over the other insurance.</P>

            <P>This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be waived without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator.

            <P>(1) If we discover before you have a flood loss that your premium payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</P>
            <P>(2) If we determine before you have a flood loss that the rating information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request. Once we determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term, we will follow the procedure in G.2.a.(1) above.</P>
            <P>(3) If we do not receive the additional premium (or additional information) by the date it is due, the amount of coverage can only be increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</P>
            <P>b. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating Information After a Loss:</P>
            <P>(1) If we discover after you have a flood loss that your premium payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the required additional premium for the current and the prior policy terms. If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30 days of the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the beginning of the prior policy term.</P>
            <P>(2) If we discover after you have a flood loss that the rating information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information before your claim can be paid. Once we determine the amount of additional premium for the current and prior policy terms, we will follow the procedure in G.2.b.(1) above.</P>

            <P>(3) If we do not receive the additional premium by the date it is due, your flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage. The amount of <PRTPAGE P="170"/>coverage can only be increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</P>
            <P>3. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of Condition B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Policy Renewal</HD>
            <P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.</P>
            <P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.</P>
            <P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake, e.g., we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:</P>
            <P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</P>
            <P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.</P>
            <P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</P>

            <P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</P>
            <P>1. Give prompt written notice to us;</P>
            <P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it;</P>
            <P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents;</P>
            <P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:</P>
            <P>a. The date and time of loss;</P>
            <P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</P>

            <P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.</P>
            <P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</P>
            <P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</P>
            <P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.</P>

            <P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</P>
            <P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</P>
            <P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and</P>
            <P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.</P>

            <P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:</P>

            <P>We may permit you to keep damaged property insured under this policy after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">P. Appraisal</HD>
            <P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of your damaged property to settle upon the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the covered property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.</P>
            <P>Each party will:</P>
            <P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and</P>
            <P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Q. Mortgage Clause</HD>
            <P>The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.</P>
            <P>Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</P>
            <P>If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</P>
            <P>1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</P>
            <P>2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and</P>
            <P>3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</P>
            <P>All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</P>

            <P>The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.<PRTPAGE P="172"/>
            </P>
            <P>If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</P>
            <P>If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</P>

This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</P>

            <P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">T. Continuous Lake Flooding</HD>
            <P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in a covered loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</P>
            <P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;</P>
            <P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</P>
            <P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location; and</P>
            <P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</P>
            <P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph T.1. will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.</P>
            <P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph T.1. above or T.2. (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph T.2., we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.</P>
            <P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and</P>
            <P>(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</P>

            <P>(3) Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. above.<PRTPAGE P="173"/>
            </P>
            <P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.</P>
            <P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</P>
            <P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:</P>
            <P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph T.2.b. above.</P>
            <P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</P>
            <P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above.</P>
            <P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”</P>
            <P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph T.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</P>
            <P>h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above, and</P>
            <P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed</HD>
            <P>1. We will not insure your property under more than one NFIP policy.</P>
            <P>If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose one of several options under the following procedures:</P>
            <P>a. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the earlier effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the later policy to the limits of the earlier policy. The change will become effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</P>
            <P>b. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the later effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the earlier policy to the limits of the later policy. The change will be effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</P>
            <P>In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased coverage limits within 30 days of the written notice. In no event will the resulting coverage limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage under the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will make a refund to you, according to applicable NFIP rules, of the premium for the policy not being kept in effect.</P>
            <P>2. Your option under Condition U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed to elect which NFIP policy to keep in effect does not apply when duplicates have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of the earlier policy. The policy with the later effective date must be canceled.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">V. Loss Settlement</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Introduction</HD>
            <P>This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in a-c. below.</P>
            <P>a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in V.2. below, applies to a single-family dwelling provided:</P>
            <P>(1) It is your principal residence, which means that, at the time of loss, you or your spouse lived there for 80% of:</P>
            <P>(a) The 365 days immediately preceding the loss; or</P>
            <P>(b) The period of your ownership, if you owned the dwelling for less than 365 days; and</P>

            <P>(2) At the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the dwelling is 80% or more of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss, or is <PRTPAGE P="174"/>the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.</P>
            <P>b. Special Loss Settlement, described in V.3. below, applies to a single-family dwelling that is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer.</P>
            <P>c. Actual Cash Value loss settlement applies to a single-family dwelling not subject to replacement cost or special loss settlement, and to the property listed in V.4. below.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement</HD>
            <P>The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling described in V.1.a. above:</P>
            <P>a. We will pay to repair or replace the damaged dwelling after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:</P>
            <P>(1) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page;</P>
            <P>(2) The replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged, with materials of like kind and quality and for like use; or</P>
            <P>(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling for like use.</P>
            <P>b. If the dwelling is rebuilt at a new location, the cost described above is limited to the cost that would have been incurred if the dwelling had been rebuilt at its former location.</P>
            <P>c. When the full cost of repair or replacement is more than $1,000, or more than 5% of the whole amount of insurance that applies to the dwelling, we will not be liable for any loss under V.2.a. above or V.4.a.(2) below unless and until actual repair or replacement is completed.</P>
            <P>d. You may disregard the replacement cost conditions above and make claim under this policy for loss to dwellings on an actual cash value basis. You may then make claim for any additional liability according to V.2.a., b., and c. above, provided you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the date of loss.</P>
            <P>e. If the community in which your dwelling is located has been converted from the Emergency Program to the Regular Program during the current policy term, then we will consider the maximum amount of available NFIP insurance to be the amount that was available at the beginning of the current policy term.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Special Loss Settlement</HD>
            <P>a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling that:</P>
            <P>(1) is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer, as defined in II.B.6.b. and c.,</P>
            <P>(2) is at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has an area of at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled, and</P>
            <P>(3) is your principal residence as specified in V.1.a.(1) above.</P>
            <P>b. If such a dwelling is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damage condition, we will, at our discretion pay the least of the following amounts:</P>

            <P>The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value (or in the case of V.4.a.(2), below, proportional) loss settlement.</P>
            <P>a. A dwelling, at the time of loss, when the amount of insurance on the dwelling is both less than 80% of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss and less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP. In that case, we will pay the greater of the following amounts, but not more than the amount of insurance that applies to that dwelling:</P>
            <P>(1) The actual cash value, as defined in II.B.2., of the damaged part of the dwelling; or</P>
            <P>(2) A proportion of the cost to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling, without deduction for physical depreciation and after application of the deductible.</P>
            <P>This proportion is determined as follows: If 80% of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the amount of insurance that represents 80% of its full replacement cost. But if 80% of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is greater than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.</P>
            <P>b. A two-, three-, or four-family dwelling.</P>
            <P>c. A unit that is not used exclusively for single-family dwelling purposes.</P>
            <P>d. Detached garages.</P>
            <P>e. Personal property.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Amount of Insurance Required</HD>
            <P>To determine the amount of insurance required for a dwelling immediately before the loss, we do not include the value of:</P>

            </P>

            <P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a structure suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: <PRTPAGE P="180"/>elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your structure. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:</P>
            <P>a. Non-residential structures. b. Residential structures with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or (c)].</P>

            </P>
            <P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A (Building Property) and Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do NOT charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Eligibility.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. A structure covered under Coverage A—Building Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss structure.” A “repetitive loss structure” is one that meets the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(a) The structure is covered by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.</P>
            <P>(b) The structure has suffered flood damage on 2 occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</P>
            <P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the time of each flood loss.</P>
            <P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the structure; or</P>
            <P>(2) Be a structure that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the structure.</P>
            <P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) 3.a.(1) above.</P>
            <P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged structures in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged structure must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged structures to elevations derived solely by the community.</P>
            <P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “freeboard” requirements, i.e., that a structure must be elevated above the base flood elevation.</P>
            <P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of structures in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</P>
            <P>d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a structure during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g. below.</P>
            <P>e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-damaged structure into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the structure had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Conditions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. When a structure covered under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</P>
            <P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P>

            <P>b. Has no legal force or effect,</P>
            <P>c. Cannot be renewed, and</P>
            <P>d. Cannot be replaced by a new NFIP policy, if, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have at any time:</P>
            <P>(1) Intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance,</P>
            <P>(2) Engaged in fraudulent conduct, or</P>
            <P>(3) Made false statements relating to this policy or any other NFIP insurance.</P>
            <P>2. This policy will be void as of the date wrongful acts described in B.1. above were committed.</P>
            <P>3. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</P>
            <P>4. This policy is also void for reasons other than fraud, misrepresentation, or wrongful act. This policy is void from its inception and has no legal force under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>a. If the property is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on the policy's inception date and did not join or re-enter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred; or</P>
            <P>b. If the property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Other Insurance</HD>
            <P>1. If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:</P>
            <P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. below applies.</P>
            <P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.</P>
            <P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in C.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.</P>
            <P>2. Where this policy covers a condominium association and there is a flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that covers the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment</HD>
            <P>This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be waived without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy can constitute a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:</P>
            <P>1. When this policy covers only personal property; or</P>
            <P>2. When this policy covers a structure during the course of construction.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Cancellation of Policy by You</HD>
            <P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P>
            <P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium also under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us</HD>
            <P>Your policy will not be renewed:</P>
            <P>1. If the community where your covered property is located stops participating in the NFIP; or</P>
            <P>2. If your building has been declared ineligible under section 1316 of the Act.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Reduction and Reformation of Coverage</HD>
            <P>1. If the premium we received from you was not enough to buy the kind and amount of coverage that you requested, we will provide only the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.</P>
            <P>2. The policy can be reformed to increase the amount of coverage resulting from the reduction described in G.1. above to the amount you requested as follows:</P>
            <P>a. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating Information Before a Loss.</P>

            <P>(1) If we discover before you have a flood loss that your premium payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the <PRTPAGE P="184"/>amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</P>
            <P>(2) If we determine before you have a flood loss that the rating information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request. Once we determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term, we will follow the procedure in G.2.a.(1) above.</P>
            <P>(3) If we do not receive the additional premium (or additional information) by the date it is due, the amount of coverage can only be increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</P>
            <P>b. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating Information After a Loss.</P>
            <P>(1) If we discover after you have a flood loss that your premium payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the required additional premium for the current and the prior policy terms. If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30 days of the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the beginning of the prior policy term.</P>
            <P>(2) If we discover after you have a flood loss that the rating information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information before your claim can be paid. Once we determine the amount of additional premium for the current and prior policy terms, we will follow the procedure in G.2.b.(1) above.</P>
            <P>(3) If we do not receive the additional premium by the date it is due, your flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage. The amount of coverage can only be increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</P>
            <P>3. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of Condition B. above apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Policy Renewal</HD>
            <P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.</P>
            <P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.</P>
            <P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake, e.g., we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:</P>
            <P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of nonreceipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</P>
            <P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.</P>
            <P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to re-certify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</P>

            <P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</P>
            <P>1. Give prompt written notice to us;</P>
            <P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it;</P>
            <P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents;</P>
            <P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:</P>
            <P>a. The date and time of loss;</P>
            <P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</P>
            <P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;</P>
            <P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</P>
            <P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;</P>

            <P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;<PRTPAGE P="185"/>
            </P>
            <P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;</P>
            <P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and</P>
            <P>i. The inventory of damaged property described in J.3. above.</P>
            <P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</P>
            <P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.</P>
            <P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within sixty days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</P>
            <P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</P>
            <P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Our Options After a Loss</HD>
            <P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:</P>
            <P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:</P>
            <P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</P>
            <P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and</P>
            <P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</P>

            <P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, and rules and regulations; and</P>
            <P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices, and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.</P>
            <P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:</P>
            <P>a. Quantities and costs;</P>
            <P>b. Actual cash values;</P>
            <P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;</P>
            <P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and</P>
            <P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</P>
            <P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</P>
            <P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and</P>
            <P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">L. No Benefit to Bailee</HD>
            <P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of covered property will benefit from this insurance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">M. Loss Payment</HD>
            <P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files an adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:</P>
            <P>a. We reach an agreement with you;</P>
            <P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</P>
            <P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII. P.</P>
            <P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</P>
            <P>a. Accept such denial of your claim;</P>
            <P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</P>
            <P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">N. Abandonment</HD>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">O. Salvage</HD>
            <P>We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">P. Appraisal</HD>

            <P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the <PRTPAGE P="186"/>state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss.</P>
            <P>Each party will:</P>
            <P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and</P>
            <P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Q. Mortgage Clause</HD>
            <P>The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.</P>
            <P>Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</P>
            <P>1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</P>
            <P>2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and</P>
            <P>3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</P>
            <P>All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</P>
            <P>The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</P>
            <P>If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</P>
            <P>If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">R. Suit Against Us</HD>
            <P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">S. Subrogation</HD>
            <P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">T. Continuous Lake Flooding</HD>
            <P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in a covered loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</P>
            <P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;</P>
            <P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</P>
            <P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location; and</P>
            <P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</P>
            <P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph T.1. will apply when as the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.</P>

            <P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph T.1. above or this paragraph T.2. (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States, where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph T.2 we will pay your <PRTPAGE P="187"/>claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.</P>
            <P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and</P>
            <P>(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes,” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain, simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</P>
            <P>(3) Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. above.</P>
            <P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show that there is sufficient reason to extend the time.</P>
            <P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</P>
            <P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:</P>
            <P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph T.2.b. above.</P>
            <P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Sec. 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</P>
            <P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above except that even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above.</P>
            <P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”</P>
            <P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this paragraph T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph T.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</P>
            <P>h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above, and</P>
            <P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed</HD>
            <P>1. Property may not be insured under more than one NFIP policy.</P>
            <P>If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose one of several options under the following procedures:</P>
            <P>a. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the earlier effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the later policy to the limits of the earlier policy. The change will become effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</P>

            <P>b. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the later effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the earlier policy to the limits of the later policy. The change will be effective as of the effective date of the later policy.<PRTPAGE P="188"/>
            </P>
            <P>In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased coverage limits within 30 days of the written notice. In no event will the resulting coverage limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage under the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less.

            <P>(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the insured building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.</P>
            <P>b. Property Removed to Safety</P>
            <P>(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood.</P>
            <P>Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, that you perform.</P>
            <P>(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property, in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there. The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building, or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.</P>
            <P>Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b. and c., must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E>
            </P>
            <P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a structure suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your structure. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:</P>
            <P>a. Non-residential structures.</P>
            <P>b. Residential structures with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or (c)].</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Limit of Liability.</E>
            </P>
            <P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A—Building Property and Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Eligibility.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. A structure covered under Coverage A—Building Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss structure.” A “repetitive loss structure” is one that meets the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(a) The structure is covered by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.</P>
            <P>(b) The structure has suffered flood damage on 2 occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</P>
            <P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the time of each flood loss.</P>
            <P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the structure; or</P>
            <P>(2) Be a structure that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the structure.</P>
            <P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) 3.a.(1) above.<PRTPAGE P="193"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged structures in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged structure must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged structures to elevations derived solely by the community.</P>
            <P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “freeboard” requirements, i.e., that a structure must be elevated above the base flood elevation.</P>
            <P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of structures in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</P>
            <P>d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a structure during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g.below relating to improvements.</P>
            <P>e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-damaged structure into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the structure had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Conditions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. When a structure covered under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</P>
            <P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</P>

            <P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.</P>
            <P>c. The loss in value to any insured building or other structure due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</P>
            <P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P>
            <P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</P>
            <P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and</P>
            <P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.</P>
            <P>f. Any code upgrade requirements, e.g., plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.</P>
            <P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</P>
            <P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.</P>
            <P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.</P>
            <P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</P>
            <P>k. Any structure insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</P>

            <P>A. When a loss is covered under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds the applicable deductible amount, subject to the limit of insurance that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.</P>
            <P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</P>
            <P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.</P>

            <P>1. At least 80% of its replacement cost; or</P>
            <P>2. The maximum amount of insurance available for that building under the NFIP, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>C. If the actual amount of insurance on the building is less than the required amount in accordance with the terms of VII. B. above, then loss payment is determined as follows (subject to all other relevant conditions in this policy, including those pertaining to valuation, adjustment, settlement, and payment of loss):</P>
            <P>1. Divide the actual amount of insurance carried on the building by the required amount of insurance.</P>
            <P>2. Multiply the amount of loss, before application of the deductible, by the figure determined in C.1. above.</P>
            <P>3. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in C.2. above.</P>
            <P>We will pay the amount determined in C.3. above, or the amount of insurance carried, whichever is less. The amount of insurance carried, if in excess of the applicable maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, is reduced accordingly.</P>

If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:</P>
            <P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. immediately below applies.</P>
            <P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.</P>
            <P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in C.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.</P>
            <P>2. If there is a flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that covers the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.</P>
            <P>D. <E T="03">Amendments, Waivers, Assignment.</E>
            </P>
            <P>This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be waived without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:</P>
            <P>1. When this policy covers only personal property; or</P>
            <P>2. When this policy covers a structure during the course of construction.</P>
            <P>E. <E T="03">Cancellation of Policy by You.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P>
            <P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium also under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.</P>
            <P>F. <E T="03">Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us.</E>
            </P>
            <P>Your policy will not be renewed:</P>
            <P>1. If the community where your covered property is located stops participating in the NFIP, or</P>
            <P>2. Your building has been declared ineligible under section 1316 of the Act.</P>
            <P>G. <E T="03">Reduction and Reformation of Coverage.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. If the premium we received from you was not enough to buy the kind and amount of coverage you requested, we will provide only the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.</P>
            <P>2. The policy can be reformed to increase the amount of coverage resulting from the reduction described in G.1. above the amount that you requested as follows:</P>
            <P>a. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating Information Before a Loss.</P>

            <P>(1) If we discover before you have a flood loss that your premium payment was not <PRTPAGE P="197"/>enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</P>
            <P>(2) If we determine before you have a flood loss that the rating information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request. Once we determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term, we will follow the procedure in G.2.a.(1) above.</P>
            <P>(3) If we do not receive the additional premium (or additional information) by the date it is due, the amount of coverage can only be increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</P>
            <P>b. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating Information After a Loss.</P>
            <P>(1) If we discover after you have a flood loss that your premium payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the required additional premium for the current and the prior policy terms. If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30 days of the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the beginning of the prior policy term.</P>
            <P>(2) If we discover after you have a flood loss that the rating information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information before your claim can be paid. Once we determine the amount of additional premium for the current and prior policy terms, we will follow the procedure in G.2.b.(1) above.</P>
            <P>(3) If we do not receive the additional premium by the date it is due, your flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage. The amount of coverage can only be increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</P>
            <P>3. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of Condition B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance above apply.</P>
            <P>H. <E T="03">Policy Renewal.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.</P>
            <P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.</P>

            <P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:</P>
            <P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of nonreceipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</P>
            <P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.</P>
            <P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to re-certify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</P>
            <P>I. <E T="03">Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance.</E>
            </P>
            <P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</P>
            <P>J. <E T="03">Requirements in Case of Loss.</E>
            </P>
            <P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</P>
            <P>1. Give prompt written notice to us;</P>
            <P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it;</P>
            <P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged personal property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts and related documents;</P>
            <P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:</P>
            <P>a. The date and time of loss;</P>
            <P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</P>

            <P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
            </P>
            <P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</P>
            <P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;</P>
            <P>f. Specifications of damaged insured buildings and detailed repair estimates;</P>
            <P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;</P>
            <P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and</P>
            <P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in J.3. above.</P>
            <P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</P>
            <P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.</P>
            <P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within sixty days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</P>
            <P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</P>
            <P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.</P>
            <P>K. <E T="03">Our Options After a Loss.</E>
            </P>
            <P>Options that we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:</P>
            <P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:</P>
            <P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</P>
            <P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and</P>
            <P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</P>
            <P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</P>
            <P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, and rules and regulations; and</P>
            <P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.</P>
            <P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:</P>
            <P>a. Quantities and costs;</P>
            <P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);</P>
            <P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;</P>
            <P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can make reasonably available to us; and</P>
            <P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</P>
            <P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</P>
            <P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and</P>
            <P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value we agree upon or its appraised value.</P>
            <P>L. <E T="03">No Benefit to Bailee.</E>
            </P>
            <P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of covered property will benefit from this insurance.</P>
            <P>M. <E T="03">Loss Payment.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files an adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:</P>
            <P>a. We reach an agreement with you;</P>
            <P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</P>
            <P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VIII. P.</P>
            <P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</P>
            <P>a. Accept such denial of your claim;</P>
            <P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</P>
            <P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.</P>
            <P>N. <E T="03">Abandonment.</E>
            </P>
            <P>You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.</P>
            <P>O. <E T="03">Salvage.</E>
            </P>
            <P>We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</P>
            <P>P. <E T="03">Appraisal.</E>
            </P>

            <P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be <PRTPAGE P="199"/>made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.</P>
            <P>Each party will:</P>
            <P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and</P>
            <P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</P>
            <P>Q. <E T="03">Mortgage Clause.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.</P>
            <P>Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</P>
            <P>If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</P>
            <P>1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk, of which the mortgagee is aware;</P>
            <P>2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and</P>
            <P>3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</P>
            <P>All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</P>
            <P>The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</P>
            <P>If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</P>
            <P>If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</P>
            <P>R. <E T="03">Suit Against Us.</E>
            </P>
            <P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</P>
            <P>S. <E T="03">Subrogation.</E>
            </P>
            <P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.</P>
            <P>T. <E T="03">Continuous Lake Flooding.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in a covered loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</P>
            <P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;</P>
            <P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</P>
            <P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location; and</P>
            <P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</P>
            <P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph T.1. will apply as long as the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.</P>

            <P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph T.1. above or this paragraph T.2. (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph T.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
            </P>
            <P>a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.</P>
            <P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and</P>
            <P>(2) Grant the conservation easement contained in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes,” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</P>
            <P>(3) Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. above.</P>
            <P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.</P>
            <P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</P>
            <P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:</P>
            <P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph T.2.b. above;</P>
            <P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Sec. 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</P>
            <P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above, except that even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above.</P>
            <P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”</P>
            <P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this paragraph T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph T.2., we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</P>
            <P>h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Director for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above, and</P>
            <P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</P>
            <P>U. <E T="03">Duplicate Policies Not Allowed.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. We will not insure your property under more than one NFIP policy.</P>
            <P>If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose one of several options under the following procedures:</P>
            <P>a. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the earlier effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the later policy to the limits of the earlier policy. The change will become effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</P>
            <P>b. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the later effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the earlier policy to the limits of the later policy. The change will be effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</P>

            <P>In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased coverage limits within 30 days of the written notice. In no event will the resulting coverage limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage under <PRTPAGE P="201"/>the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will make a refund to you, according to applicable NFIP rules, of the premium for the policy not being kept in effect.</P>
            <P>2. The insured's option under this condition U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed to elect which NFIP policy to keep in effect does not apply when duplicates have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of the earlier policy. The policy with the later effective date must be canceled.</P>

            <P>This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in a.-c. below.</P>
            <P>a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement described in V.2. below applies to buildings other than manufactured homes or travel trailers.</P>
            <P>b. Special Loss Settlement described in V.3. below applies to a residential condominium building that is a travel trailer or a manufactured home.</P>
            <P>c. Actual Cash Value loss settlement applies to all other property covered under this policy, as outlined in V.4. below.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement</HD>
            <P>a. We will pay to repair or replace a damaged or destroyed building, after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the building;</P>
            <P>(2) The replacement cost of that part of the building damaged, with materials of like kind and quality, and for like occupancy and use; or</P>
            <P>(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the building for like occupancy and use.</P>
            <P>b. We will not be liable for any loss on a Replacement Cost Coverage basis unless and until actual repair or replacement of the damaged building or parts thereof, is completed.</P>
            <P>c. If a building is rebuilt at a location other than the described location, we will pay no more than it would have cost to repair or rebuild at the described location, subject to all other terms of Replacement Cost Loss Settlement.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Special Loss Settlement</HD>
            <P>a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a residential condominium building that is: (1) a manufactured home or travel trailer, as defined in II.B.6.b. and c., and (2) at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled.</P>
            <P>b. If such a building is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damaged condition, we will, at our discretion, pay the least of the following amounts:</P>
            <P>(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the manufactured home or travel trailer or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Building Limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.</P>
            <P>c. If such a manufactured home or travel trailer is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damaged condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost Loss Settlement conditions in V.2. above.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement</HD>
            <P>a. The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value loss settlement:</P>
            <P>(1) Personal property;</P>
            <P>(2) Insured property abandoned after a loss and that remains as debris at the described location;</P>
            <P>(3) Outside antennas and aerials, awning, and other outdoor equipment;</P>
            <P>(4) Carpeting and pads;</P>
            <P>(5) Appliances; and</P>
            <P>(6) A manufactured home or mobile home or a travel trailer as defined in II.B.6.b. or c. that does not meet the conditions for special loss settlement in V.3. above.</P>
            <P>b. We will pay the least of the following amounts:</P>
            <P>(1) The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;</P>
            <P>(2) The actual cash value (as defined in II.B.2.); or</P>
            <P>(3) The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Liberalization Clause</HD>
            <P>If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">X. What Law Governs</HD>

              <P>A Standard Flood Insurance Policyholder whose property has been determined not to be in a special hazard area after the map revision or a Letter of Map Amendment under part 70 of this subchapter may cancel the policy within the current policy year provided (a) he was required to purchase or to maintain flood insurance coverage, or both, as a condition for financial assistance, and (b) his property was located in an identified special hazard area as represented on an effective FHBM or FIRM when the financial assistance was provided. If no claim under the policy has been paid or is pending, the full premium shall be refunded for the current policy year, and for an additional policy year where the insured had been required to renew the policy during the period when a revised map was being reprinted. A Standard Flood Insurance Policyholder may cancel a policy having a term of three (3) years, on an anniversary date, where the reason for the cancellation is that a policy of flood insurance has been obtained or is being obtained in substitution for the NFIP policy and the NFIP obtains a written concurrence in the cancellation from any mortgage of which the NFIP has actual notice; or the policyholder has extinguishing the insured mortgage debt and is no longer required by the mortgagee to maintain the coverage. In such event, the premium refund shall be pro rata but with retention of the expense constant.</P>

              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Decision</E> means the insurer's final claim determination, which is the insurer's written denial, in whole or in part, of the insured's claim.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> A National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholder, whether insured by a participating Write-Your-Own (WYO) Company or directly by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), may appeal a <E T="03">decision</E>, including a determination of any insurance agent, adjuster, insurance company, or any FEMA employee or contractor with respect to a claim, proof of loss, and loss estimate. In order to file an appeal, the insured must comply with all requirements set out in the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP). This appeals process is available after the issuance of the insurer's final claim determination, which is the insurer's written denial, in whole or in part, of the insured's claim. Once the final claim determination is issued, an insured may appeal any action taken by the insurer, FEMA employee, FEMA contractor, insurance adjuster, or insurance agent.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations on Appeals.</E> The appeals process is intended to resolve claim issues and is not intended to grant coverage or limits that are not provided by the SFIP. Filing an appeal does not waive any of the requirements for perfecting a claim under the SFIP or extend any of the time limitations set forth in the SFIP.</P>
              <P>(1) Disputes that are or have been subject to appraisal as provided for in the SFIP cannot be appealed under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) When a policyholder files an appeal on any issue, that issue is no longer subject to resolution by appraisal or other pre-litigation remedies.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Litigation preclusion.</E> An insured who files suit against an insurer on the flood insurance claim issue is prohibited from filing an appeal under this section. All appeals submitted for decision but not yet resolved shall be terminated upon notice of the commencement of litigation regarding the claim.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> To pursue an appeal under this section a policyholder must:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a written appeal to FEMA within 60 days from the date of the decision.</P>
              <P>(2) Provide a copy of the insurer's written denial, in whole or in part, of the claim;</P>
              <P>(3) Identify relevant policy and claim information and state the basis for the appeal; and</P>

              <P>(4) Submit relevant documentation to support the appeal. The policyholder should submit only the documentation that pertains to his or her claim. The following are examples of the kinds of documentation which FEMA will require to adjudicate the appeal: A copy of the proof of loss submitted to the insurer as required in the policy; room by room itemized estimates from the adjuster (includes contractors' estimates), detailing unit cost and quantities for the items needing repair or replacement; replacement cost proofs of loss; Preliminary Report; Final Report; detailed damaged personal property inventories that include the approximate age of the items; completed Mobile Home Worksheet; Mobile Home Title, including Salvage Titles; real estate appraisals that exclude land values; advance payment information; clear photographs (exterior and interior) confirming damage resulted from direct physical loss by or from flood; proof of prior repair; evidence of insurance and policy information , <E T="03">i.e.</E> declarations page; Elevation Certificate, if the risk is an elevated building; the community's determination made concerning substantial damage; information regarding substantial improvement; zone determinations; pre-loss and post-loss inventories; financial statements; tax records, lease agreements, sales contracts, settlement papers, deed, <E T="03">etc.</E>; emergency (911) address change information; salvage information (proceeds and sales); condominium association by-laws; proof of other insurance, including homeowners or wind policies and any claim information submitted to the other companies; Waiver, Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) information; paid receipts and invoices including cancelled checks that support an insured's out-of-pocket expenses pertaining to the claim; underwriting decisions; architectural plans and drawings; death certificates; a copy of the will; divorce decree, power of attorney; current lienholder <PRTPAGE P="205"/>information; current loss payee information; paid receipts and invoices documenting damaged stock; detailed engineering reports specifically addressing flood-related damage and pre-existing damage; engineering surveys; market values; documentation of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dates; documentation reflecting date(s) of construction and substantial improvement; loan documents including closings; evidence of insurability as a Residential Condominium Association; Franchise Agreements; letters of representation, <E T="03">i.e.</E> attorneys and public adjusters; any assignment of interest in a claim; and, any other pertinent information which FEMA may request in processing a claim.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeal resolution.</E> (1) FEMA will acknowledge, in writing, receipt of a policyholder's appeal and include in the acknowledgement contact information for a FEMA point of contact who can advise the policyholder as to the status of his or her claim.</P>
              <P>(2) The <E T="03">Federal Insurance Administrator</E> will review the appeal documents and may notify the policyholder in writing of the need for additional information. A request for the additional information will include the date by which the information must be provided, and shall in no case be less than 14 calendar days. Failure to provide the requested information in full, or to request an extension by the due date, may result in a dismissal of the appeal. A re-inspection of the policyholder's property may be conducted at the discretion of the <E T="03">Federal Insurance Administrator</E> to gather more information. The <E T="03">Federal Insurance Administrator</E> will ensure that all information necessary to rule on the appeal has been provided prior to making an <E T="03">appeal decision.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The <E T="03">Federal Insurance Administrator</E> will review the appeal documents, including any reinspection report, if appropriate. The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide specific information on what grounds the claim was denied initially. The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide an <E T="03">appeal decision</E> in writing to the policyholder and insurer within 90 days from the date that all information has been submitted by the policyholder and include specific information for the resolution of the appeal. No further administrative review will be provided to the insured.</P>

              <SUBJECT>WYO Companies authorized.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to section 1345 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator may enter into arrangements with individual private sector property insurance companies or other insurers, such as public entity risk sharing organizations. Under these arrangements, such companies or other insurers may offer flood insurance coverage under the program to eligible applicants. Such WYO companies may offer flood coverage to policyholders insured by them under their own property business lines of insurance, pursuant to their customary business practices, including their usual arrangements with agents and producers. WYO companies may sell flood insurance coverage in any State in which the WYO company is authorized to engage in the business of property insurance. Other WYO insurers may offer flood insurance coverage to their pool members insured by them under their own property business lines of coverage, pursuant to their customary business practices. These other WYO insurers may provide flood coverage in any State that has authorized the other insurer to provide property coverage to its members. Arrangements entered into by WYO companies or other insurers under this subpart must be in the form and substance of the standard arrangement, titled “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement.” Each year, at least six months before the effective date of the “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement,” FEMA must publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and make available to the WYO companies the terms for subscription or re-subscription to the “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement.”</P>
              <P>(b) Any duly authorized insurer so engaged in the Program shall be a WYO Company. (The term “WYO Company” shall include the following kinds of insurers: Public entity risk-sharing organizations, an association of local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a State-sponsored municipal league, and other intergovernmental risk-sharing pool for covering public entity structures.)</P>
              <P>(c) A WYO Company is authorized to arrange for the issuance of flood insurance in any amount within the maximum limits of coverage specified in § 61.6 of this subchapter, as Insurer, to any person qualifying for such coverage under parts 61 and 64 of this subchapter who submits an application to the WYO Company; coverage shall be issued under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P>
              <P>(d) A WYO Company issuing flood insurance coverage shall arrange for the adjustment, settlement, payment and defense of all claims arising from policies of flood insurance it issues under the Program, based upon the terms and conditions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P>
              <P>(e) In carrying out its functions under this subpart, a WYO Company shall use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act and regulations prescribed by the Federal Insurance Administrator under the Act.</P>

              <P>(f) To facilitate the marketing of flood insurance coverage under the Program to policyholders of WYO Companies, the Federal Insurance Administrator will enter into arrangements with such companies whereby the Federal Government will be a guarantor in which the primary relationship between the WYO Company and the Federal Government will be one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are accounted for and appropriately expended. In furtherance of this end, the Federal Insurance Administrator has established “A Plan to <PRTPAGE P="207"/>Maintain Financial Control for Business Written Under the Write Your Own Program.”</P>
              <P>(g) A WYO Company shall act as a fiscal agent of the Federal Government, but not as its general agent. WYO Companies are solely responsible for their obligations to their insured under any flood insurance policies issued under agreements entered into with the Federal Insurance Administrator, such that the Federal Government is not a proper party defendant in any lawsuit arising out of such policies.</P>
              <P>(h) To facilitate the underwriting of flood insurance coverage by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies:</P>
              <P>(1) To expedite business growth, the WYO Company will encourage its present property insurance policyholders to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP WYO Program.</P>
              <P>(2) To conform its underwriting practices to the underwriting rules and rates in effect as to the NFIP, the WYO Company will establish procedures to carry out the NFIP rating system and provide its policyholders with the same coverage as is afforded under the NFIP.</P>
              <P>(3) The WYO Company may follow its customary billing practices to meet the Federal rules on the presentment of premium and net premium deposits to a Letter of Credit bank account authorized by the Federal Insurance Administrator and reduction of coverage when an underpayment is discovered.</P>
              <P>(4) The WYO Company is expected to meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan. Transactions reported by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan will be analyzed by the NFIP Bureau &amp; Statistical Agent. A monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions that have not passed systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on the WYO Company's reconciliation reports.</P>
              <P>(5) If a WYO Company rejects an application from an agent or a producer, the agent or producer shall be notified so that the business can be placed through the NFIP Servicing Agent, or another WYO Company.</P>
              <P>(6) Flood insurance coverage will be issued by the WYO Company on a separate policy form and will not be added, by endorsement, to the Company's other property insurance forms.</P>
              <P>(7) Premium payment plans can be offered by the WYO Company so long as the net premium depository requirements specified under the NFIP/WYO Program accounting procedures are met. A cancellation by the WYO Company for non-payment of premium will not produce a pro rata return of the net premium deposit to the WYO Company.</P>
              <P>(8) NFIP business will not be assumed by the WYO Companies at any time other than at renewal time, at which time the insurance producer may submit the business to the WYO Company as new business. However, it is permissible to cancel and rewrite flood policies to obtain concurrent expiration dates with other policies covering the property.</P>
              <P>(i) To facilitate the adjustment of flood insurance claims by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies.</P>
              <P>(1) WYO companies will adjust claims in accordance with general company standards, guided by NFIP Claims manuals. The Arrangement provides that claim adjustments shall be binding upon the FIA.</P>
              <P>(2) The WYO Company may use its staff adjusters, independent adjusters, or both. It is important that the Company's Claims Department verifies the correctness of the coverage interpretations and reasonableness of the payments recommended by the adjusters.</P>
              <P>(3) An established loss adjustment Fee Schedule is part of the Arrangement and cannot be changed during an Arrangement year. This is the expense allowance to cover costs of independent or WYO Company adjusters.</P>
              <P>(4) The normal catastrophe claims procedure currently operated by a WYO Company should be implemented in the event of a claim catastrophe situation. Flood claims will be handled along with other catastrophe claims.</P>

              <P>(5) It will be the WYO Company's responsibility to try to detect fraud (as it <PRTPAGE P="208"/>does in the case of property insurance) and coordinate its findings with FIA.</P>
              <P>(6) Pursuant to the Arrangement, the responsibility for defending claims will be upon the Write Your Own Company and defense costs will be part of the unallocated or allocated claim expense allowance, depending on whether a staff counsel or an outside attorney handles the defense of the matter. Claims in litigation will be reported by WYO Companies to FIA upon joinder of issue and FIA may inquire and be advised of the disposition of such litigation.</P>
              <P>(7) The claim reserving procedures of the individual WYO Company can be used.</P>
              <P>(8) Regarding the handling of subrogation, if a WYO Company prefers to forego pursuit of subrogation recovery, it may do so by referring the matter, with a complete copy of the claim file, to FIA. Subrogation initiatives may be truncated at any time before suit is commenced (after commencing an action, special arrangement must bemade). FIA, after consultation with FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC), will forward the cause of action to OCC or to the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent for prosecution. Any funds received will be deposited, less expenses, in the National Flood Insurance Fund.</P>
              <P>(9) Special allocated loss adjustment expenses will include such items as: nonstaff attorney fees, engineering fees and special investigation fees over and above normal adjustment practices.</P>
              <P>(10) The customary content of claim files will include coverage verification, normal adjuster investigations, including statements where necessary, police reports, building reports and investigations, damage verification and other documentation relevant to the adjustment of claims under the NFIP's and the WYO Company's traditional claim adjustment practices and procedures. The WYO Company's claim examiners and managers will supervise the adjustment of flood insurance claims by staff and independent claims adjusters.</P>
              <P>(11) The WYO Company will extend reasonable cooperation to FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel on matters pertaining to litigation and subrogation, under paragraph (i)(8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) To facilitate establishment of financial controls under the WYO Program, the WYO Company will:</P>
              <P>(1) Have a biennial audit of the flood insurance financial statements conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm at the Company's expense to ensure that the financial data reported to us accurately represents the flood insurance activities of the Company. The CPA firm must conduct its audits in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (commonly known as “yellow book” requirements). The Company must file with us (the Federal Insurance Administration) a report of the CPA firm's detailed biennial audit, and, after our review of the audit report, we will convey our determination to the Standards Committee.</P>
              <P>(2) Participate in a WYO Company/FIA Operation review. We will conduct a review of the WYO Company's flood insurance claims, underwriting, customer service, marketing, and litigation activities at least once every three (3) years. As part of these reviews, we will reconcile specific files with a listing of transactions submitted by the Company under the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRPP) Plan (Part 5). We will file a report of the Operation Review with the Standards Committee.</P>

              <P>(3) Meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual. Transactions reported to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Bureau and Statistical Agent by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual will be analyzed by the Bureau and Statistical Agent and a monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of the WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions which do not pass systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated <PRTPAGE P="209"/>from transaction reports with those submitted on WYO Company reconciliation reports.</P>
              <P>(4) Cooperate with FEMA's Chief Financial Officer on Letter of Credit matters.</P>
              <P>(5) Cooperate with FIA in the implementation of a claims reinspection program.</P>
              <P>(6) Cooperate with FIA in the verification of risk rating information.</P>
              <P>(7) Cooperate with DHS's Office of the Inspector General on matters pertaining to fraud.</P>
              <P>(k) To facilitate the operation of the WYO Program and in order that a WYO Company can use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator, for good cause shown, may grant exceptions to and waivers of the regulations contained in this title relative to the administration of the NFIP.</P>
              <P>(l)(1) WYO Companies may, on a voluntary basis, elect to participate in the Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP), under which they can offer, as a last resort, flood insurance at special high rates, sufficient to recover the full cost of this program in recognition of the uncertainty as to the degree of risk a given building presents due to the limited underwriting data required, to properties in a lending institution's mortgage portfolio to achieve compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Flood insurance policies under the MPPP may only be issued for those properties that:</P>
              <P>(i) Are determined to be located within special flood hazard areas of communities that are participating in the NFIP, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Are not covered by a flood insurance policy even after a required series of notices have been given to the property owner (mortgagor) by the lending institution of the requirement for obtaining and maintaining such coverage, but the mortgagor has failed to respond.</P>
              <P>(2) WYO Companies participating in the MPPP must provide a detailed implementation package to any lending institution that, on a voluntary basis, chooses to participate in the MPPP to ensure the lending institution has full knowledge of the criteria in that program and must obtain a signed receipt for that package from the lending institution. Participating WYO companies must also maintain evidence of compliance with paragraph (l)(3) of this section for review during the audits and reviews required by the WYO Financial Control Plan.</P>
              <P>(3) The mortgagor must be protected against the lending institution's arbitrary placing of flood insurance for which the mortgagor will be billed by being sent three notification letters as described in paragraphs (l)(4) through (6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The initial notification letter must:</P>
              <P>(i) State the requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended;</P>
              <P>(ii) Announce the determination that the mortgagor's property is in an identified special flood hazard area as delineated on the appropriate FEMA map, necessitating flood insurance coverage for the duration of the loan;</P>
              <P>(iii) Describe the procedure to follow should the mortgagor wish to challenge the determination;</P>
              <P>(iv) Request evidence of a valid flood insurance policy or, if there is none, encourage the mortgagor to obtain a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) promptly from a local insurance agent (or WYO Company);</P>
              <P>(v) Advise that the premium for a MPPP policy is significantly higher than a conventional SFIP policy and advise as to the option for obtaining less costly flood insurance; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Advise that a MPPP policy will be purchased by the lender if evidence of flood insurance coverage is not received by a date certain.</P>
              <P>(5) The second notification letter must remind the mortgagor of the previous notice and provide essentially the same information.</P>
              <P>(6) The final notification letter must:</P>

              <P>(i) Enclose a copy of the flood insurance policy purchased under the MPPP on the mortgagor's (insured's) behalf, together with the Declarations Page,<PRTPAGE P="210"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Advise that the policy was purchased because of the failure to respond to the previous notices, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Remind the insured that similar coverage may be available at significantly lower cost and advise that the policy can be cancelled at any time during the policy year and a pro rata refund provided for the unearned portion of the premium in the event the insured purchases another policy that is acceptable to satisfy the requirements of the 1973 Act.</P>

              <P>(a) To demonstrate the ability to meet the financial requirements, a private insurance company wishing to enter or reenter the WYO program must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be a licensed property insurance company;</P>
              <P>(2) Have a five (5) year history of writing property insurance;</P>

              <P>(4) Submit its most recent National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) annual statement;</P>
              <P>(5) Submit information, as data become available, to indicate that the company meets or exceeds NAIC standards for risk-based capital and surplus; and</P>
              <P>(6) Submit its last State or regional audit, which should contain no material negative findings.</P>
              <P>(b) To demonstrate the ability to meet the financial requirements, a public entity risk-sharing organization, an association of local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a State-sponsored municipal league, and any other intergovernmental risk-sharing pool for covering public entity structures, wishing to enter the WYO program, which will end September 30, 2004, must:</P>
              <P>(1) Have authority by a State to provide property coverage to its members;</P>

              <P>(c) An applicant for entry or reentry in the WYO program must also pass a test to determine the applicant's ability to process flood insurance and meet the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRRP) Plan requirements of the WYO Financial Control Plan. Unless the test requirement is waived, e.g., where an already qualified performer will fulfill the applicant's reporting requirements, the applicant must prepare and submit test output monthly tape(s) and monthly financial statements and reconciliations for processing by the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent contractor. For test purposes, no error tolerance will be allowed. If the applicant fails the initial test, a second test will be run, which the applicant must pass to participate in the Program.</P>

              <P>(d) To satisfy the requirement for commitment to Program goals, including marketing of flood insurance policies, the applicant will submit information concerning its plans for the <PRTPAGE P="211"/>WYO Program including plans for the training and support of producers and staff, marketing plans and sales targets, and claims handling and disaster response plans. Applicants must also identify those aspects of their planned flood insurance operations to be performed by another organization, managing agent, another WYO Company, a WYO vendor, a service bureau or related organization. Applicants will also name, in addition to a Principal Coordinator, a corporate officer point of contact—an individual, e.g., at the level of Senior Executive Vice President, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer. Each applicant shall furnish the latest available information regarding the number of its fire, allied lines, farm-owners multiple peril, homeowners multiple peril, and commercial multiple peril policies or coverage documents in force, by line. A private insurance company applying for participation in the WYO program shall also furnish its Best's Financial Size Category for the purpose of setting marketing goals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose of part.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The purpose of this part is to implement section 1306(c) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (the Act). Section 544 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242) amended the Act by adding subsection (c) to section 1306 of the Act. Under this amendment, effective February 5, 1988, section 1306(c) of the Act provides for benefit payments under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) for demolition or relocation of a structure insured under the Act that is located along the shore of a lake or other body of water and that is certified by an appropriate State or local land use authority to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels. This part establishes criteria by which States can obtain the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator to make these certifications and sets forth the procedures and data requirements to be used by those States in making these certifications. This part also contains provisions regarding other aspects of section 1306(c) of the Act. For example, there are provisions regarding section 1306(c)(6)(B) of the Act (which provides for condemnation <PRTPAGE P="212"/>in lieu of certification), including clarification as to the form of condemnation issued under a State or local law that is required.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Condemnation in lieu of certification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The condemnation required by section 1306(c)(6)(B) of the Act in lieu of certification need not be grounded in a finding that the structure is subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion, but may be issued for other reasons deemed sufficient by the State or local authority.</P>
              <P>(b) The condemnation may be in the form of a court order or other instrument authorized by State or local law, e.g., a notification to the property owner of an unsafe condition, or unsanitary condition, or other deficiency at the property address, coupled with a statement that the property owner must vacate the property if the condition giving rise to the condemnation notice is not cured by repair, removal, or demolition of the building by a date certain.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to a condemnation in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a structure must be found by the Federal Insurance Administrator to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels to be eligible for benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 63.13</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Purpose of subpart.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to establish criteria under the provisions of section 1306(c) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, by which States can obtain approval from the Federal Insurance Administrator to certify that structures are subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels. The subpart also sets forth the procedures and data requirements to be utilized by those States in certifying structures as subject to imminent collapse. The State certification procedure represents an option to the use of the procedure whereby a structure is condemned by a State or local authority as a prerequisite to consideration for imminent collapse insurance benefits.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 63.14</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Criteria for State qualification to perform imminent collapse certifications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In order to qualify under this subpart, the State must be administering a coastal zone management program which includes the following components, as a minimum:</P>

              <P>(a) A state-wide requirement that prohibits new construction and the relocation of structures seaward of an adopted erosion setback. Such setback <PRTPAGE P="214"/>must be based in whole or in part on some multiple of the local mean annual erosion (recession) rate; and</P>
              <P>(b) An established, complete and functional data base of mean annual erosion rates for all reaches of coastal shorelines subject to erosion in the State, which is used as the basis to enforce these setback requirements.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 63.15</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>State application for eligibility to certify structures subject to imminent collapse.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Application pursuant to this part shall be made by the Governor or other duly authorized official of the State.</P>
              <P>(b) The application must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472.</P>
              <P>(c) Documents to be included in the application are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations verifying the existence of a coastal zone management program including setback requirements for new and relocated construction which are based in whole or in part on mean annual erosion rates established for the State's shorelines.</P>
              <P>(2) A copy of the State's mean annual erosion rate data base, if not already provided, showing such rates for all reaches of coastal shorelines subject to erosion within the State.</P>
              <P>(3) The title, address and phone number of a contact person within the State agency having authority for administering the coastal zone management program.</P>
              <P>(4) A statement that adequate resources are available to carry out the certification services, and that certifications will be performed in accordance with the procedures described in § 63.17.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 63.16</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Review of State application by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator may return the application for eligibility upon finding it incomplete or upon finding that additional information is required in order to make a determination as to the adequacy of the coastal zone management program and erosion rate data base.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon determining that the State's program and/or data base does not meet the criteria set forth in § 63.14, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall in writing reject the application for eligibility and indicate in what respects the State program and/or data base fails to comply with the criteria.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon determining that the State program and data base meets the criteria set forth in § 63.14, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall approve the State as eligible to certify structures subject to imminent collapse. Such approval, however, is in all cases provisional. The Federal Insurance Administrator shall review the State program and data base for continued compliance with the criteria set forth in this part and may request updated documentation for the purpose of such review. If the program and/or data base is found to be inadequate and is not corrected within ninety days from the date that such inadequacies were identified, the Federal Insurance Administrator may revoke his approval.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 63.17</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures and data requirements for imminent collapse certifications by States.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Any State that has been determined to be eligible by the Federal Insurance Administrator may certify that a coastal structure is subject to imminent collapse. Such certification requires that the State collect scientific or technical information relative to the structure and its site and provide such information to the insured to be filed with a claim for insurance benefits under Section 1306 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. The information which is provided to the insured shall include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Certification from the State agency that the structure is subject to imminent collapse. The certification shall cite the property address, legal description (e.g., lot, block), the date of application for certification, and the date of and basis for the certification, and</P>

              <P>(b) Supporting scientific and technical data to substantiate the certification consisting of the following:<PRTPAGE P="215"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Photographs of the structure in relation to the obvious peril. All photographs should be labeled with the location, direction, date and time from which they were taken. The collection of photographs should adequately display the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Any evidence of existing damage. The damage can include loss or erosion of soil near or around the foundation, or structural damage to the foundation components.</P>
              <P>(ii) Structure and waterbody. These photographs shall show both the structure and the waterbody that presents the peril. If the structure is on a high bluff or dune and not accessible from the water side, the top edge of the bluff or dune will be sufficient. These will usually be taken from one or both sides of the structure.</P>
              <P>(iii) Physical reference features used in the measurements discussed below. The reference feature shall be in or near the area affected by normal tides, when applicable. If a reference is not clearly distinguishable on the photograph, it should be annotated to identify the feature. If possible, all reference features described below should be photographed showing their relationship to the site of the threatened structure.</P>
              <P>(2) Identification and selection of reference features. The following reference features are presented according to priority. If the first feature is not present, the next feature shall be located and photographed, and so forth.</P>
              <P>(i) Top edge of bluff (cliff top).</P>
              <P>(ii) Top edge of escarpment on an eroding dune (i.e., a nearly vertical erosional cut at the seaward face of the dune). The normal high tide should be near the toe of the dune and there should be indications that the dune is actively eroding.</P>
              <P>(iii) The normal high tide limit may be indicated by one of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Vegetation line (the seaward most edge of permanent vegetation).</P>
              <P>(B) Beach scarp (erosion line on beach, usually a sharp, nearly vertical drop of 0.5 to 3.0 feet at the upper limit of high tide).</P>
              <P>(C) Debris line deposited by the normal high tide, not by a recent storm.</P>
              <P>(D) Upper limit of wet sand.</P>
              <P>(3) Distance measurements from the threatened structure to the nearest points on the reference features. These measurements should be taken from all photographed reference features to the closest point on the supporting foundation. For purposes of making this measurement, decks, stairs, and other exterior attachments that do not contribute to the structural support of the building are not considered part of the structure. The measurements shall be taken horizontally with a tape and recorded to the nearest foot. The date and time of the measurement shall be noted. The location of the measurements (i.e., reference feature and closest structural member) shall be identified on the appropriate photograph or sketch of the site. If some or all of the reference features coincide, this shall also be noted and identified on the photographs. Reference features landward of the structure need not be measured, but shall be noted on the photographs.</P>
              <P>(4) A determination of the average annual erosion rate at the site and a copy of the pertinent section of the reference document used to obtain the annual erosion rate at the site.</P>
              <P>(5) Copy of the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panel annotated with the location of the threatened structure.</P>
              <P>(6) In the event that a structure is not situated within a “zone of imminent collapse” using the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, then the State may submit other scientific and technical data, in addition to the information described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, that would reveal unusual erosive or stability conditions at the site. Such data must include engineering analyses or reports performed on the structure or site which evaluates local rates of erosion, or the condition or stability of the structure's foundation including supporting soil.</P>

              <P>(c) In the case of structures planned to be relocated, a certification as to whether the proposed relocation site is outside the 30-year setback for 1-4 family residential structures, or outside <PRTPAGE P="216"/>the 60-year setback for all other structures, must also be submitted by the State.</P>

            <P>(a) 42 U.S.C. 4012(c), 4022 and 4102 require that flood insurance in the maximum limits of coverage under the regular program shall be offered in communities only after the Federal Insurance Administrator has: (1) Identified the areas of special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion hazards within the community; and/or (2) completed a risk study for the applicant community. The priorities for conducting such risk studies are set forth in §§ 59.23 and 60.25 of this subchapter. The purpose of this part is to define the types of zones which the Agency will use for identifying the hazard areas on maps.</P>
            <P>(b) 42 U.S.C. 4056 authorizes an emergency implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program whereby the Federal Insurance Administrator may make subsidized coverage available to eligible communities prior to the completion of detailed risk studies for such areas. This part also describes procedures under the emergency program and lists communities which become eligible under the NFIP.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Effect on community eligibility resulting from boundary changes, governmental reorganization, etc.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When a community not participating in the Program acquires by means of annexation, incorporation, or otherwise, an area within another community participating in the Program, no new flood insurance shall be made available as of the effective date of annexation until the newly acquiring community participates in the Program. Until the effective date of participation, existing flood insurance policies remain in effect until the policy's date of expiration, but shall not be renewed.</P>

            <P>(b) When a community participating in the Program acquires by means of annexation, incorporation, or otherwise, another area which was previously located in a community either participating or not participating in the Program, the community shall have six months from the date of acquisition to formally amend its flood plain management regulations in order to include all flood-prone areas within the newly acquired area. The amended regulations shall satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 of this subchapter based on the data previously provided by the Administrator. In the event that the newly acquired area was previously located in a community participating in the Program, the provisions of this section shall only apply if the community, upon acquisition, and pending formal adoption of the amendment to its flood plain management regulations, certifies in writing over the signature of a community official that within the newly acquired area <PRTPAGE P="218"/>the flood plain management requirements previously applicable in the area remain in force. In the event that the newly-acquired area was previously located in a community not participating in the Program, the provisions of the section shall only apply if the community, upon acquisition, and pending formal adoption of the amendments to its flood plain management regulations, certifies in writing over the signature of a community official that it shall enforce within the newly-acquired area the requirements of § 60.3(b) of this subchapter. During the six month period, existing flood insurance policies shall remain in effect until their date of expiration may be renewed, and new policies may be issued. Failure to satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 shall result in the community's suspension from Program participation pursuant to § 59.24 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(c) When an area previously a part of a community participating in the Program becomes autonomous or becomes a portion of a newly autonomous community resulting from boundary changes, governmental reorganization, changes in state statutes or constitution, or otherwise, such new community shall be given six months from the date of its independence, to adopt flood plain management regulations within the special hazard areas subject to its jurisdiction and to submit its application for participation as a separate community in order to retain eligibility for the sale of flood insurance. The regulations adopted by such new community shall satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 of this subchapter based on the data previously provided by the Federal Insurance Administrator. The provisions of this section shall only apply where the new community upon the date of its independence certifies in writing over the signature of a community official that, pending formal adoption of flood plain management regulations, the flood plain management requirements previously applicable in that area remain in effect. During the six month period, existing flood insurance policies shall remain in effect until their dates of expiration may be renewed, and new policies may be issued. Failure to satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 of this subchapter shall result in the community's suspension from Program participation pursuant to § 59.24 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(d) Where any community or any area within a community had in effect a FHBM or FIRM, but all or a portion of that community has been acquired by another community, or becomes autonomous, that map shall remain in effect until it is superseded by the Federal Insurance Administrator, whether by republication as part of the map of the acquiring community, or otherwise.</P>
            <P>(e) When a community described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section has flood elevations in effect, no new appeal period under parts 66, 67, and 68 of this subchapter will begin except as new scientific and technical data are available.</P>

            <P>(3) A topographic map or other information indicating existing ground elevations and the date of fill. FEMA's determination to exclude a legally defined parcel of land or a structure from the area of special flood hazard will be based upon a comparison of the base flood elevations to the lowest ground elevation of the parcel or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. If the lowest ground elevation of the entire legally defined parcel of land or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure are at or above the elevations of the base flood, FEMA will exclude the parcel and/or structure from the area of special flood hazard.</P>

            <P>(5) If the community cannot assure that it has complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3, of this chapter, the map revision request will be deferred until the community remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible through coordination with FEMA. Once the remedies are in place, and the community assures that the land and structures are “reasonably safe from flooding,” we will process a revision to the SFHA using the criteria set forth in § 65.5(a).

            <SUBJECT>Revision of base flood elevation determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General conditions and data requirements.</E> (1) The supporting data must include all the information FEMA needs to review and evaluate the request. This may involve the requestor's performing new hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and delineation of new flood plain boundaries and floodways, as necessary.</P>
            <P>(2) To avoid discontinuities between the revised and unrevised flood data, the necessary hydrologic and hydraulic analyses submitted by the map revision requestor must be extensive enough to ensure that a logical transition can be shown between the revised flood elevations, flood plain boundaries, and floodways and those developed previously for areas not affected by the revision. Unless it is demonstrated that it would not be appropriate, the revised and unrevised base flood elevations must match within one-half foot where such transitions occur.</P>

            <P>(3) Revisions cannot be made based on the effects of proposed projects or <PRTPAGE P="222"/>future conditions. Section 65.8 of this subchapter contains provisions for obtaining conditional approval of proposed projects that may effect map changes when they are completed.</P>
            <P>(4) The datum and date of releveling of benchmarks, if any, to which the elevations are referenced must be indicated.</P>
            <P>(5) Maps will not be revised when discharges change as a result of the use of an alternative methodology or data for computing flood discharges unless the change is statistically significant as measured by a confidence limits analysis of the new discharge estimates.</P>
            <P>(6) Any computer program used to perform hydrologic or hydraulic analyses in support of a flood insurance map revision must meet all of the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) It must have been reviewed and accepted by a governmental agency responsible for the implementation of programs for flood control and/or the regulation of flood plain lands. For computer programs adopted by non-Federal agencies, certification by a responsible agency official must be provided which states that the program has been reviewed, tested, and accepted by that agency for purposes of design of flood control structures or flood plain land use regulation.</P>
            <P>(ii) It must be well-documented including source codes and user's manuals.</P>
            <P>(iii) It must be available to FEMA and all present and future parties impacted by flood insurance mapping developed or amended through the use of the program. For programs not generally available from a Federal agency, the source code and user's manuals must be sent to FEMA free of charge, with fully-documented permission from the owner that FEMA may release the code and user's manuals to such impacted parties.</P>
            <P>(7) A revised hydrologic analysis for flooding sources with established base flood elevations must include evaluation of the same recurrence interval(s) studied in the effective FIS, such as the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood discharges.</P>
            <P>(8) A revised hydraulic analysis for a flooding source with established base flood elevations must include evaluation of the same recurrence interval(s) studied in the effective FIS, such as the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood elevations, and of the floodway. Unless the basis of the request is the use of an alternative hydraulic methodology or the requestor can demonstrate that the data of the original hydraulic computer model is unavailable or its use is inappropriate, the analysis shall be made using the same hydraulic computer model used to develop the base flood elevations shown on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and updated to show present conditions in the flood plain. Copies of the input and output data from the original and revised hydraulic analyses shall be submitted.</P>
            <P>(9) A hydrologic or hydraulic analysis for a flooding source without established base flood elevations may be performed for only the 100-year flood.</P>
            <P>(10) A revision of flood plain delineations based on topographic changes must demonstrate that any topographic changes have not resulted in a floodway encroachment.</P>
            <P>(11) Delineations of flood plain boundaries for a flooding source with established base flood elevations must provide both the 100- and 500-year flood plain boundaries. For flooding sources without established base flood elevations, only 100-year flood plain boundaries need be submitted. These boundaries should be shown on a topographic map of suitable scale and contour interval.</P>

            <P>(12) If a community or other party seeks recognition from FEMA, on its FHBM or FIRM, that an altered or relocated portion of a watercourse provides protection from, or mitigates potential hazards of, the base flood, the Federal Insurance Administrator may request specific documentation from the community certifying that, and describing how, the provisions of § 60.3(b)(7) of this subchapter will be met for the particular watercourse involved. This documentation, which may be in the form of a written statement from the Community Chief Executive Officer, an ordinance, or other legislative action, shall describe the nature of the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency with which they will be performed, and the title of the local community official who will <PRTPAGE P="223"/>be responsible for assuring that the maintenance activities are accomplished.</P>
            <P>(13) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 65.6, a community may submit, in lieu of the documentation specified in § 65.6(a)(12), certification by a registered professional engineer that the project has been designed to retain its flood carrying capacity without periodic maintenance.</P>
            <P>(14) The participating community must provide written assurance that they have complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3 of this chapter. This includes the requirements that:</P>
            <P>(i) Existing residential structures built in the SFHA have their lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood;</P>
            <P>(ii) The participating community has determined that the land and any existing or proposed structures to be removed from the SFHA are “reasonably safe from flooding,” and that they have on file, available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used to make that determination;</P>
            <P>(iii) The participating community has issued permits for all existing and proposed construction or other development; and</P>
            <P>(iv) All necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies where approval is required by Federal, State, or local law.</P>
            <P>(15) If the community cannot assure that it has complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3, of this chapter the map revision request will be deferred until the community remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible through coordination with FEMA. Once the remedies are in place, and the community assures that the land and structures are “reasonably safe from flooding,” we will process a revision to the SFHA using the criteria set forth under § 65.6. The community must maintain on file, and make available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used in determining that the land or structures are “reasonably safe from flooding.”</P>

            <SUBJECT>Mapping of areas protected by levee systems.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> For purposes of the NFIP, FEMA will only recognize in its flood hazard and risk mapping effort those levee systems that meet, and continue to meet, minimum design, operation, and maintenance standards that are consistent with the level of protection sought through the comprehensive flood plain management criteria established by § 60.3 of this subchapter. Accordingly, this section describes the types of information FEMA needs to recognize, on NFIP maps, that a levee system provides protection from the base flood. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a levee system at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought based on a levee system, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized structures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how a structure or system will perform in a flood event.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Design criteria.</E> For levees to be recognized by FEMA, evidence that adequate design and operation and maintenance systems are in place to provide reasonable assurance that protection from the base flood exists must be provided. The following requirements must be met:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Freeboard.</E> (i) Riverine levees must provide a minimum freeboard of three feet above the water-surface level of the base flood. An additional one foot above the minimum is required within 100 feet in either side of structures (such as bridges) riverward of the levee or wherever the flow is constricted. An additional one-half foot above the minimum at the upstream end of the levee, tapering to not less than the minimum at the downstream end of the levee, is also required.</P>
            <P>(ii) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum riverine freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood elevation profile and include, but not necessarily be limited to an assessment of statistical confidence limits of the 100-year discharge; changes in stage-discharge relationships; and the sources, potential, and magnitude of debris, sediment, and ice accumulation. It must be also shown that the levee will remain structurally stable during the base flood when such additional loading considerations are imposed. Under no circumstances will freeboard of less than two feet be accepted.</P>
            <P>(iii) For coastal levees, the freeboard must be established at one foot above the height of the one percent wave or the maximum wave runup (whichever is greater) associated with the 100-year stillwater surge elevation at the site.</P>

            <P>(iv) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum coastal levee freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood loading conditions. Particular emphasis must be placed on the effects of wave attack and overtopping on the stability of the <PRTPAGE P="227"/>levee. Under no circumstances, however, will a freeboard of less than two feet above the 100-year stillwater surge elevation be accepted.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Closures.</E> All openings must be provided with closure devices that are structural parts of the system during operation and design according to sound engineering practice.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Embankment protection.</E> Engineering analyses must be submitted that demonstrate that no appreciable erosion of the levee embankment can be expected during the base flood, as a result of either currents or waves, and that anticipated erosion will not result in failure of the levee embankment or foundation directly or indirectly through reduction of the seepage path and subsequent instability. The factors to be addressed in such analyses include, but are not limited to: Expected flow velocities (especially in constricted areas); expected wind and wave action; ice loading; impact of debris; slope protection techniques; duration of flooding at various stages and velocities; embankment and foundation materials; levee alignment, bends, and transitions; and levee side slopes.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Embankment and foundation stability.</E> Engineering analyses that evaluate levee embankment stability must be submitted. The analyses provided shall evaluate expected seepage during loading conditions associated with the base flood and shall demonstrate that seepage into or through the levee foundation and embankment will not jeopardize embankment or foundation stability. An alternative analysis demonstrating that the levee is designed and constructed for stability against loading conditions for Case IV as defined in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) manual, “Design and Construction of Levees” (EM 1110-2-1913, Chapter 6, Section II), may be used. The factors that shall be addressed in the analyses include: Depth of flooding, duration of flooding, embankment geometry and length of seepage path at critical locations, embankment and foundation materials, embankment compaction, penetrations, other design factors affecting seepage (such as drainage layers), and other design factors affecting embankment and foundation stability (such as berms).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> Engineering analyses must be submitted that assess the potential and magnitude of future losses of freeboard as a result of levee settlement and demonstrate that freeboard will be maintained within the minimum standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This analysis must address embankment loads, compressibility of embankment soils, compressibility of foundation soils, age of the levee system, and construction compaction methods. In addition, detailed settlement analysis using procedures such as those described in the COE manual, “Soil Mechanics Design—Settlement Analysis” (EM 1100-2-1904) must be submitted.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Interior drainage.</E> An analysis must be submitted that identifies the source(s) of such flooding, the extent of the flooded area, and, if the average depth is greater than one foot, the water-surface elevation(s) of the base flood. This analysis must be based on the joint probability of interior and exterior flooding and the capacity of facilities (such as drainage lines and pumps) for evacuating interior floodwaters.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Other design criteria.</E> In unique situations, such as those where the levee system has relatively high vulnerability, FEMA may require that other design criteria and analyses be submitted to show that the levees provide adequate protection. In such situations, sound engineering practice will be the standard on which FEMA will base its determinations. FEMA will also provide the rationale for requiring this additional information.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Operation plans and criteria.</E> For a levee system to be recognized, the operational criteria must be as described below. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual, a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or when the manual for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by <PRTPAGE P="228"/>Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Closures.</E> Operation plans for closures must include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists for the completed operation of all closure structures, including necessary sealing, before floodwaters reach the base of the closure.</P>
            <P>(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.</P>
            <P>(iii) Provisions for periodic operation, at not less than one-year intervals, of the closure structure for testing and training purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Interior drainage systems.</E> Interior drainage systems associated with levee systems usually include storage areas, gravity outlets, pumping stations, or a combination thereof. These drainage systems will be recognized by FEMA on NFIP maps for flood protection purposes only if the following minimum criteria are included in the operation plan:</P>
            <P>(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists to permit activation of mechanized portions of the drainage system.</P>
            <P>(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.</P>
            <P>(iii) Provision for manual backup for the activation of automatic systems.</P>
            <P>(iv) Provisions for periodic inspection of interior drainage systems and periodic operation of any mechanized portions for testing and training purposes. No more than one year shall elapse between either the inspections or the operations.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other operation plans and criteria.</E> Other operating plans and criteria may be required by FEMA to ensure that adequate protection is provided in specific situations. In such cases, sound emergency management practice will be the standard upon which FEMA determinations will be based.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Maintenance plans and criteria.</E> For levee systems to be recognized as providing protection from the base flood, the maintenance criteria must be as described herein. Levee systems must be maintained in accordance with an officially adopted maintenance plan, and a copy of this plan must be provided to FEMA by the owner of the levee system when recognition is being sought or when the plan for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All maintenance activities must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP that must assume ultimate responsibility for maintenance. This plan must document the formal procedure that ensures that the stability, height, and overall integrity of the levee and its associated structures and systems are maintained. At a minimum, maintenance plans shall specify the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency of their performance, and the person by name or title responsible for their performance.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification requirements.</E> Data submitted to support that a given levee system complies with the structural requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the levee must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition given at § 65.2 of this subchapter. In lieu of these structural requirements, a Federal agency with responsibility for levee design may certify that the levee has been adequately designed and constructed to provide protection against the base flood.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Mapping and map revisions for areas subject to alluvial fan flooding.</SUBJECT>

            <P>This section describes the procedures to be followed and the types of information FEMA needs to recognize on a NFIP map that a structural flood control measure provides protection from the base flood in an area subject to alluvial fan flooding. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a flood control measure at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized flood control measures. The <PRTPAGE P="230"/>FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how the flood control measure will perform in a flood event.</P>
            <P>(a) The applicable provisions of §§ 65.2, 65.3, 65.4, 65.6, 65.8 and 65.10 shall also apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fan flooding.</P>
            <P>(b) The provisions of § 65.5 regarding map revisions based on fill and the provisions of part 70 of this chapter shall not apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fan flooding. In general, elevations of a parcel of land or a structure by fill or other means, will not serve as a basis for removing areas subject to alluvial fan flooding from an area of special food hazards.</P>
            <P>(c) FEMA will credit on NFIP maps only major structural flood control measures whose design and construction are supported by sound engineering analyses which demonstrate that the measures will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the area protected by such measures. The provided analyses must include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Engineering analyses that quantify the discharges and volumes of water, debris, and sediment movement associated with the flood that has a one-percent probability of being exceeded in any year at the apex under current watershed conditions and under potential adverse conditions (e.g., deforestation of the watershed by fire). The potential for debris flow and sediment movement must be assessed using an engineering method acceptable to FEMA. The assessment should consider the characteristics and availability of sediment in the drainage basin above the apex and on the alluvial fan.</P>
            <P>(2) Engineering analyses showing that the measures will accommodate the estimated peak discharges and volumes of water, debris, and sediment, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and will withstand the associated hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces.</P>
            <P>(3) Engineering analyses showing that the measures have been designed to withstand the potential erosion and scour associated with estimated discharges.</P>
            <P>(4) Engineering analyses or evidence showing that the measures will provide protection from hazards associated with the possible relocation of flow paths from other parts of the fan.</P>
            <P>(5) Engineering analyses that assess the effect of the project on flood hazards, including depth and velocity of floodwaters and scour and sediment deposition, on other areas of the fan.</P>
            <P>(6) Engineering analyses demonstrating that flooding from sources other than the fan apex, including local runoff, is either insignificant or has been accounted for in the design.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> FEMA will recognize measures that are adequately designed and constructed, provided that: evidence is submitted to show that the impact of the measures on flood hazards in all areas of the fan (including those not protected by the flood control measures), and the design and maintenance requirements of the measures, were reviewed and approved by the impacted communities, and also by State and local agencies that have jurisdiction over flood control activities.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance plans and criteria.</E> The requirements for operation and maintenance of flood control measures on areas subject to alluvial fan flooding shall be those specified under § 65.10, paragraphs (c) and (d), when applicable.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Certification requirements.</E> Data submitted to support that a given flood control measure complies with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (6) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the flood control measures must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition given at § 65.2.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This section describes the procedures to follow and the types <PRTPAGE P="231"/>of information FEMA requires to designate flood control restoration zones. A community may be eligible to apply for this zone designation if the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that it is engaged in the process of restoring a flood protection system that was:</P>
            <P>(i) Constructed using Federal funds;</P>
            <P>(ii) Recognized as providing base flood protection on the community's effective FIRM; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Decertified by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a community is in the process of restoring its flood protection system to provide base flood protection, a FIRM will be prepared that designates the temporary flood hazard areas as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR). Existing special flood hazard areas shown on the community's effective FIRM that are further inundated by Zone AR flooding shall be designated as a “dual” flood insurance rate zone, Zone AR/AE or AR/AH with Zone AR base flood elevations, and AE or AH with base flood elevations and Zone AR/AO with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone AO with flood depths, or Zone AR/A with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone A without base flood elevations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> A community may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once while restoring a flood protection system. This limitation does not preclude future flood control restoration zone designations should a fully restored, certified, and accredited system become decertified for a second or subsequent time.</P>
            <P>(1) A community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing or constructing, or both, the restoration project must complete restoration or meet the requirements of 44 CFR 61.12 within a specified period, not to exceed a maximum of 10 years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone.</P>
            <P>(2) A community that does not receive Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must complete restoration within a specified period, not to exceed a maximum of 5 years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone. Such a community is not eligible for the provisions of § 61.12. The designated restoration period may not be extended beyond the maximum allowable under this limitation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> The provisions of these regulations do not apply in a coastal high hazard area as defined in 44 CFR 59.1, including areas that would be subject to coastal high hazards as a result of the decertification of a flood protection system shown on the community's effective FIRM as providing base flood protection.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective date for risk premium rates.</E> The effective date for any risk premium rates established for Zone AR shall be the effective date of the revised FIRM showing Zone AR designations.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Application and submittal requirements for designation of a flood control restoration zone.</E> A community must submit a written request to the Federal Insurance Administrator, signed by the community's Chief Executive Officer, for a flood plain designation as a flood control restoration zone. The request must include a legislative action by the community requesting the designation. The Federal Insurance Administrator will not initiate any action to designate flood control restoration zones without receipt of the formal request from the community that complies with all requirements of this section. The Federal Insurance Administrator reserves the right to request additional information from the community to support or further document the community's formal request for designation of a flood control restoration zone, if deemed necessary.</P>
            <P>(1) At a minimum, the request from a community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing, constructing, or both, the restoration project must include:</P>

            <P>(i) A statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the community's Chief Executive Officer, the flood protection system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency, and if so, the purpose of that litigation;<PRTPAGE P="232"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) A statement whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from the Federal Insurance Administrator, and if so, a statement that details the disposition of such previous request;</P>
            <P>(iii) A statement from the community and certification by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction that the existing flood control system shown on the effective FIRM was originally built using Federal funds, that it no longer provides base flood protection, but that it continues to provide protection from the flood having at least a 3-percent chance of occurrence during any given year;</P>
            <P>(iv) An official map of the community or legal description, with supporting documentation, that the community will adopt as part of its flood plain management measures, which designates developed areas as defined in § 59.1 and as further defined in § 60.3(f).</P>
            <P>(v) A restoration plan to return the system to a level of base flood protection. At a minimum, this plan must:</P>
            <P>(A) List all important project elements, such as acquisition of permits, approvals, and contracts and construction schedules of planned features;</P>
            <P>(B) Identify anticipated start and completion dates for each element, as well as significant milestones and dates;</P>
            <P>(C) Identify the date on which “as built” drawings and certification for the completed restoration project will be submitted. This date must provide for a restoration period not to exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system, or;</P>
            <P>(D) Identify the date on which the community will submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of § 61.12. This date may not exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system;</P>
            <P>(vi) A statement identifying the local project sponsor responsible for restoration of the flood protection system;</P>
            <P>(vii) A copy of a study, performed by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction in consultation with the local project sponsor, which demonstrates a Federal interest in restoration of the system and which deems that the flood protection system is restorable to a level of base flood protection.</P>
            <P>(viii) A joint statement from the Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction involved in restoration of the flood protection system and the local project sponsor certifying that the design and construction of the flood control system involves Federal funds, and that the restoration of the flood protection system will provide base flood protection;</P>
            <P>(2) At a minimum, the request from a community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must:</P>
            <P>(i) Meet the requirements of § 65.14(e)(1)(i) through (iv);</P>

            </P>
            <P>(vi) Include a statement from the local agency responsible for restoration of the flood protection system that identifies the source of funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project and a percentage of the total funds contributed by each source. The statement must demonstrate, at a minimum, that 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been appropriated.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Review and response by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</E> The review and response by the Federal Insurance Administrator shall be in accordance with procedures specified in § 65.9.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Requirements for maintaining designation of a flood control restoration zone.</E> During the restoration period, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency, if any, must certify annually to the FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the restoration plan within the time period specified by the plan. In addition, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency, if any, will update the restoration plan and will identify any permitting or construction problems that will delay the project completion from the restoration plan previously submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction will make an annual assessment and recommendation to the Federal Insurance Administrator as to the viability of the restoration plan and will conduct periodic on-site inspections of the flood protection system under restoration.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to adequate progress or complete restoration of the flood protection system.</E> At any time during the restoration period:</P>
            <P>(1) A community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing, constructing, or both, the restoration project shall provide written evidence of certification from a Federal agency having flood protection design or construction responsibility that the necessary improvements have been completed and that the system has been restored to provide protection from the base flood, or submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of § 61.12. If the Administrator determines that adequate progress has been made, FEMA will revise the zone designation from a flood control restoration zone designation to Zone A99.</P>
            <P>(2) After the improvements have been completed, certified by a Federal agency as providing base flood protection, and reviewed by FEMA, FEMA will revise the FIRM to reflect the completed flood control system.</P>
            <P>(3) A community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must provide written evidence that the restored flood protection system meets the requirements of Part 65. A community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project is not eligible for a finding of adequate progress under § 61.12.</P>
            <P>(4) After the improvements have been completed and reviewed by FEMA, FEMA will revise the FIRM to reflect the completed flood protection system.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to non-compliance with the restoration schedule or as a result of a finding that satisfactory progress is not being made to complete the restoration.</E> At any time during the restoration period, should the Federal Insurance Administrator determine that the restoration will not be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is not being made to restore the flood protection system to provide complete flood protection in accordance with the restoration plan, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community and the responsible Federal agency, in writing, of the determination, the reasons for that determination, and that the FIRM will be revised to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, the community may submit written information that provides assurance that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is being made to restore complete protection in accordance with the restoration plan, or that, with reasonable certainty, the <PRTPAGE P="234"/>restoration will be completed within the maximum allowable restoration period. On the basis of this information the Federal Insurance Administrator may suspend the decision to revise the FIRM to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. If the community does not submit any information, or if, based on a review of the information submitted, there is sufficient cause to find that the restoration will not be completed as provided for in the restoration plan, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall revise the FIRM, in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67, and shall remove the flood control restoration zone designations and shall redesignate those areas as Zone A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A.</P>

            <P>(a) Section 528 of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 1365(a)) directs FEMA to develop a standard form for determining, in the case of a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home, whether the building or mobile home is located in an area identified by the Director as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance under this title is available. The purpose of the form is to determine whether a building or mobile home is located within an identified Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), whether flood insurance is required, and whether federal flood insurance is available. Use of this form will ensure that required flood insurance coverage is purchased for structures located in an SFHA, and will assist federal entities for lending regulation in assuring compliance with these purchase requirements.</P>

            <P>(a) The sole basis of appeal under this part shall be the possession of knowledge or information indicating that the elevations proposed by FEMA are scientifically or technically incorrect. Because scientific and technical correctness is often a matter of degree rather than absolute (except where mathematical or measurement error or changed physical conditions can be demonstrated), appellants are required to demonstrate that alternative methods or applications result in more correct estimates of base flood elevations, thus demonstrating that FEMA's estimates are incorrect.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Data requirements.</E> (1) If an appellant believes the proposed base flood elevations are technically incorrect due to a mathematical or measurement error or changed physical conditions, then the specific source of the error must be identified. Supporting data must be furnished to FEMA including certifications by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor, of the new data necessary for FEMA to conduct a reanalysis.</P>
            <P>(2) If an appellant believes that the proposed base flood elevations are technically incorrect due to error in application of hydrologic, hydraulic or other methods or use of inferior data in applying such methods, the appeal must demonstrate technical incorrectness by:</P>
            <P>(i) Identifying the purported error in the application or the inferior data.</P>
            <P>(ii) Supporting why the application is incorrect or data is inferior.</P>
            <P>(iii) Providing an application of the same basic methods utilized by FEMA but with the changes itemized.</P>
            <P>(iv) Providing background technical support for the changes indicating why the appellant's application should be accepted as more correct.</P>
            <P>(v) Providing certification of correctness of any alternate data utilized or measurements made (such as topographic information) by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor, and</P>
            <P>(vi) Providing documentation of all locations where the appellant's base flood elevations are different from FEMA's.</P>

            <P>(3) If any appellant believes the proposed base flood elevations are scientifically incorrect, the appeal must demonstrate scientific incorrectness by:<PRTPAGE P="239"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Identifying the methods, or assumptions purported to be scientifically incorrect.</P>
            <P>(ii) Supporting why the methods, or assumptions are scientifically incorrect.</P>
            <P>(iii) Providing an alternative analysis utilizing methods, or assumptions purported to be correct.</P>
            <P>(iv) Providing technical support indicating why the appellant's methods should be accepted as more correct and</P>
            <P>(v) Providing documentation of all locations where the appellant's base flood elevations are different from FEMA's.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this part is to provide an administrative procedure whereby the Federal Insurance Administrator will review the scientific or technical submissions of an owner or lessee of property who believes his property has been inadvertently included in designated A, AO, A1-30, AE, AH, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE, and V Zones, as a result of the transposition of the curvilinear line to either street or to other readily identifiable features. The necessity for this part is due in part to the technical difficulty of accurately delineating the curvilinear line on either an FHBM or FIRM. These procedures shall not apply when there has been any alteration of topography since the effective date of the first <PRTPAGE P="243"/>NFIP map (i.e., FHBM or FIRM) showing the property within an area of special flood hazard. Appeals in such circumstances are subject to the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(1) An actual copy of the recorded plat map bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official (e.g. County Clerk, or Recorder of Deeds) indicating the official recordation and proper citation (Deed or Plat Book Volume and Page Numbers), or an equivalent identification where annotation of the deed or plat book is not the practice.</P>
              <P>(2) A topographical map showing (i) ground elevation contours in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NVGD) of 1929, (ii) the total area of the property in question, (iii) the location of the structure or structures located on the property in question, (iv) the elevation of the lowest adjacent grade to a structure or structures and (v) an indication of the curvilinear line which represents the area subject to inundation by a base flood. The curvilinear line should be based upon information provided by any appropriate authoritative source, such as a Federal Agency, the appropriate state agency (e.g. Department of Water Resources), a County Water Control District, a County or City Engineer, a Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Study, or a determination by a Registered Professional Engineer;</P>
              <P>(3) A copy of the FHBM or FIRM indicating the location of the property in question;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose of part.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part provides administrative and cost-recovery procedures for the engineering review and administrative processing associated with FEMA's response to requests for Conditional Letters of Map Amendment (CLOMAs), Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs), Conditional Letters of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-Fs), Letters of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-Fs), Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs), and Physical Map Revisions (PMRs). Such requests are based on proposed or actual manmade alterations within the floodplain, such as the placement of fill; modification of a channel; construction or modification of a bridge, culvert, levee, or similar measure; or construction of single or multiple residential or commercial structures on single or multiple lots.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Except as otherwise provided in this part, the definitions in 44 CFR part 59 are applicable to this part. For the purposes of this part, the products are defined as follows:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">CLOMA.</E> A CLOMA is FEMA's comment on a proposed structure or group of structures that would, upon construction, be located on existing natural ground above the base (1-percent-annual-chance) flood elevation on a portion of a legally defined parcel of land that is partially inundated by the base flood.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">CLOMR.</E> A CLOMR is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">CLOMR-F.</E> A CLOMR-F is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, result in a modification of the SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">LOMR.</E> A LOMR is FEMA's modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), or both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the SFHA. The LOMR officially revises the FIRM or FBFM, and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and, when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">LOMR-F.</E> A LOMR-F is FEMA's modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">PMR.</E> A PMR is FEMA's physical revision and republication of an effective FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report. PMRs are generally based on physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the SFHA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fee schedule.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) For requests for CLOMRs, LOMRs, and PMRs based on structural measures on alluvial fans, an initial fee of $5,000, subject to the provisions of § 72.4, shall be paid to FEMA before FEMA begins its review of the request. The initial fee represents the minimum cost for reviewing these requests and is based on the prevailing private-sector labor rate. A revision to this initial fee, if necessary, will be published as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(b) For requests for CLOMRs, LOMRs, and PMRs based on structural measures on alluvial fans, the total fee will be calculated based on the total hours by FEMA to review and process the request multiplied by an hourly rate based on the prevailing private-sector labor rate. The hourly rate is published as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> A revision to the hourly rate, if necessary, shall be published as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="250"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) For conditional and final map revision requests for the following categories, flat user fees, subject to the provisions of § 72.4, shall be paid to FEMA before FEMA begins its review of the request:</P>
            <P>(1) Requests for CLOMAs, CLOMR-Fs, and LOMR-Fs for single structures or single lots;</P>
            <P>(2) Requests for CLOMAs for multiple structures or multiple lots;</P>
            <P>(3) Requests for CLOMR-Fs and LOMR-Fs for multiple structures or multiple lots;</P>
            <P>(4) Requests LOMR-Fs for single structures or single lots based on as-built information for projects for which FEMA issued CLOMR-Fs previously;</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for LOMR-Fs for multiple structures or multiple lots based on as-built information for projects for which FEMA issued CLOMR-Fs previously;</P>
            <P>(6) Requests for LOMRs and PMRs based on projects involving bridges, culverts, or channels, or combinations thereof;</P>
            <P>(7) Requests for LOMRs and PMRs based on projects involving levees, berms, or other structural measures;</P>
            <P>(8) Requests for LOMRs and PMRs based on as-built information for projects for which FEMA issued CLOMRs previously, except those based on structural measures on alluvial fans;</P>
            <P>(9) Requests for LOMRs and PMRs based solely on more detailed data;</P>
            <P>(10) Requests for CLOMRs based on projects involving new hydrologic information, bridges, culverts, or channels, or combinations thereof; and</P>
            <P>(11) Requests for CLOMRs based on projects involving levees, berms, or other structural measures.</P>
            <P>(d) If a request involves more than one of the categories listed above, the highest applicable flat user fee must be submitted.</P>
            <P>(e) The flat user fees for conditional and final map amendments and map revisions are based on the actual costs for reviewing and processing the requests. The fees for requests for LOMR-Fs, LOMRs, and PMRs also include a fee of $35 to cover FEMA's costs for physically revising affected FIRM and FBFM panels to reflect the map changes.</P>

            <P>(f) Revisions to the fees, if necessary, shall be published as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

The procedure in § 72.4 also applies to a resubmitted request (regardless of when submitted) if the project on which the request is based has been altered significantly in design or scope other than as necessary to respond to comments, concerns, or other findings made by FEMA regarding the original submission.</P>
            <P>(b) When LOMR, LOMR-F, or PMR requests are made after FEMA issues CLOMRs or CLOMR-Fs, the procedures in § 72.4 and the appropriate fee apply, as referenced in § 72.3(c). When the as-built conditions differ from the proposed conditions on which FEMA issued the CLOMRs or CLOMR-Fs, the reduced fee for as-built requests will not apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to be exempt under this part, the State's self-insurance plan shall, as a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) Constitute a formal policy or plan of self-insurance created by statute or regulation authorized pursuant to statute.</P>
              <P>(2) Specify that the hazards covered by the self-insurance plan expressly include the flood and flood-related hazards which are covered under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P>
              <P>(3) Provide coverage to state-owned structures and their contents equal to that which would otherwise be available under a Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P>

              <P>(4) Consist of a self-insurance fund, or a commercial policy of insurance or reinsurance, for which provision is made in statute or regulation and that is funded by periodic premiums or charges allocated for state-owned structures and their contents in areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, <PRTPAGE P="254"/>AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones. The person or persons responsible for such self-insurance fund shall report on its status to the chief executive authority of the State, or to the legislature, or both, not less frequently than annually. The loss experience shall be shown for each calendar or fiscal year from inception to current date based upon loss and loss adjustment expense incurred during each separate calendar or fiscal year compared to the premiums or charges for each of the respective calendar or fiscal years. Such incurred losses shall be reported in aggregate by cause of loss under a loss coding system adequate, as a minimum, to identify and isolate loss caused by flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion. The Federal Insurance Administrator may, subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, accept and approve in lieu of, and as the reasonable equivalent of the self-insurance fund, an enforceable commitment of funds by the State, the enforceability of which shall be certified to by the State's Attorney General, or other principal legal officer. Such funds, or enforceable commitment of funds in amounts not less than the limits of coverage that would be applicable under Standard Flood Insurance Policies, shall be used by the State for the repair or restoration of State-owned structures and their contents damaged as a result of flood-related losses occurring in areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones.</P>
              <P>(5) Provide for the maintaining and updating by a designated State official or agency not less frequently than annually of an inventory of all State-owned structures and their contents within A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E zones. The inventory shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Include the location of individual structures;</P>
              <P>(ii) Include an estimate of the current replacement costs of such structures and their contents, or of their current economic value; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Include an estimate of the anticipated annual loss due to flood damage.</P>
              <P>(6) Provide the flood loss experience for State-owned structures and their contents based upon incurred losses for a period of not less than the 5 years immediately preceding application for exemption, and certify that such historical information shall be maintained and updated.</P>
              <P>(7) Include, pursuant to § 60.12 of this subchapter, a certified copy of the flood plain management regulations setting forth standards for State-owned properties within A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones.</P>
              <P>(b) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall determine the adequacy of the insurance provisions whether they be based on available funds, an enforceable commitment of funds, commercial insurance, or some combination thereof, but has discretion to waive specific requirements under this part.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) Upon determining that the State's plan of self-insurance is inadequate, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall in writing reject the application for exemption and shall state in what respects the plan fails to comply with the standards set forth in § 75.11 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon determining that the State's plan of self-insurance equals or exceeds the standards set forth in § 75.11 of this subpart, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall certify that the State is exempt from the requirement for the purchase of flood insurance for State-owned structures and their contents located or to be located in areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones. Such exemption, however, is in all cases provisional. The Federal Insurance Administrator shall review the plan for continued compliance with the criteria set forth in this part and may request updated documentation for the purpose of such review. If the plan is found to be inadequate and is not corrected within ninety days from the date that such inadequacies were identified, the Federal Insurance Administrator may revoke his certification.</P>
              <P>(d) Documentation which cannot reasonably be provided at the time of application for exemption shall be submitted within six months of the application date. The Federal Insurance Administrator may revoke his certification for a State's failure to submit adequate documentation after the six month period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to prescribe actions, procedures, and requirements for administration of the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program, authorized by Sections 1366 and 1367 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4104c and 4104d. The rules in this part apply to the administration of funds awarded under the FMA program for which the application period opened prior to December 3, 2007. On or after that date, the administration of funds awarded under FMA program shall be subject to the rules in part 79 of this subchapter.</P>

            <P>(b) The purpose of FMA is to assist State and local governments in funding cost-effective actions that reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of flood damage to buildings, manufactured homes, and other insured structures. <PRTPAGE P="256"/>The long-term goal of FMA is to reduce or eliminate claims under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through mitigation activities. The program provides cost-shared grants for three purposes: Planning Grants to States and communities to assess the flood risk and identify actions to reduce that risk; Project Grants to execute measures to reduce flood losses; and Technical Assistance Grants that States may use to assist communities to develop viable FMA applications and implement FMA projects. FMA also outlines a process for development and approval of Flood Mitigation Plans.</P>

The rules in this part apply to the administration of funds under the SRL and FMA programs for which the application period opens on or after December 3, 2007. Prior to this date, the administration of funds under the FMA program shall be subject to the rules in part 78 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(b) The purpose of the SRL program is to:</P>
            <P>(1) Assist State and local governments in funding actions that reduce or eliminate the risk of flood damage to residential properties insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that meet the definition of severe repetitive loss property;</P>
            <P>(2) Reduce the need to increase flood insurance premiums of NFIP policyholders that would otherwise be required to pay for potential future repetitive claims associated with severe repetitive loss properties; and</P>
            <P>(3) Reduce loss of life, property damage, outlays for the NFIF, and Federal disaster assistance by reducing or eliminating the risk of flood damage to those insured properties that have historically experienced the most severe flood losses.</P>

            <P>(v) For SRL only, demolition and rebuilding of properties to at least base flood levels or higher, if required by FEMA or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Minor physical localized flood reduction measures that lessen the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood damages, and that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of other Federal agencies. Major flood control projects such as dikes, levees, floodwalls, seawalls, groins, jetties, dams and large-scale waterway channelization projects are not eligible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Minimum project criteria.</E> In addition to being an eligible project type, mitigation grant projects must also:</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 79.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Offers and appeals under the SRL program.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> States and communities shall consult, to the extent practicable, and in accordance with criteria determined by the Administrator, with owners of the severe repetitive loss properties to select the most appropriate eligible mitigation activity. These consultations shall be initiated in the early stages of the project development, and shall continue throughout the process. After FEMA awards the project grant, the subgrantee shall continue to consult with the property owners to determine the specific conditions of the offer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Mitigation offer.</E> After FEMA awards the grant and the subgrantee completes final consultations with the property owners, the subgrantee shall develop and present official offers to the property owners participating in the mitigation activities.</P>

            <P>(1) The offer shall include all pertinent information regarding the mitigation activity, including a detailed description of the activity (<E T="03">e.g.</E> property acquisition, elevation), the responsibilities of and benefits to the property owner, a summary of the consultation process, timeframes, and the consequences of refusing such offer. For open space acquisitions, it will also include the market value of the property, the basis for the purchase offer, and the final offer amount. The offer will also clearly state that the property owner's participation in the SRL program is voluntary.</P>
            <P>(2) The subgrantee will send the written offer to the property owner's current mailing address as a certified letter, along with a copy to the appropriate FEMA Regional Administrator. In addition, the subgrantee will notify each holder of a recorded interest on the property when such offer is extended, along with the identification of the mitigation assistance being offered.</P>
            <P>(3) The property owner will have 45 days from the date of the letter to accept or refuse the offer of mitigation assistance in writing. Failure to respond in writing within this time period will be deemed a refusal of the offer.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Insurance increases due to refusal of offer.</E> In any case in which the property owner refuses an offer of mitigation assistance made through the SRL program, the Administrator shall provide written notice that the chargeable insurance rates with respect to the property will increase effective on the next renewal of the policy.</P>
            <P>(1) The chargeable insurance premium rate shall be increased to the amount equal to 150 percent of the chargeable rate for the property at the time that the offer was made, as adjusted by any other premium adjustments otherwise applicable to the property. Each time there is another claim payment in excess of $1,500, the chargeable premium rate for that property shall be the amount equal to 150 percent over the chargeable rate at the time of every such claim, as adjusted by any other premium adjustments otherwise applicable to the property. The increases shall end when the actuarial rate is reached.</P>
            <P>(2) Upon each renewal or modification of the flood insurance coverage, the property owner will be able to accept the original mitigation offer, if the community, through the State, forwards the request to FEMA, and if sufficient funds are available.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeals of insurance rate increases.</E> Any owner of a severe repetitive loss property may appeal the decision to increase the chargeable insurance premium rate as described in paragraph (c) of this section by submitting a written appeal, including supporting documentation that is postmarked or delivered to the appropriate FEMA Regional Administrator within 90 days of the date of the notice of the insurance increase. The increase in the amount of <PRTPAGE P="265"/>chargeable premium rate for flood insurance coverage for the property will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(1) Appeals must be based upon one or more of the following grounds. The property owner must include documentation to support each ground serving as a basis for the appeal:</P>
            <P>(i) The offered mitigation activity is an acquisition and the property owner would be unable to purchase a replacement of the primary residence that is of comparable value and that is functionally equivalent. The property owner must document the actions taken to locate such replacement dwelling and demonstrate that no such dwelling is available.</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) The amount of Federal funds offered for a mitigation activity, when combined with funds from the required non-Federal sources, would not cover the actual eligible costs of the mitigation activity contained in the mitigation offer, based on independent information. In the case of an acquisition, the purchase offer is not an accurate estimation of the market value of the property, based on independent information.</P>
            <P>(B) For a mitigation activity other than acquisition, the property owner must submit independent estimates from professional engineers or registered architects to support this claim. For an acquisition, the property owner must submit an appraisal from a qualified appraiser to support this claim, and valuations will be considered by a review appraiser.</P>
            <P>(iii) The offered mitigation activity would diminish the integrity of a historic district, site, building, or object's significant historic characteristics to the extent where the historic resource would lose its status as listed or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The property owner must submit appropriate documentation from the State Historic Preservation Officer/Tribal Historic Preservation Officer to support this claim.</P>
            <P>(iv) For a multifamily property: Each of the flood insurance claims payments that served as the basis for its designation as a severe repetitive loss property must have resulted directly from the actions of a third party in violation of Federal, State, or local law, ordinance, or regulation. The property owner(s) must submit appropriate evidence, documentation, or data to support this claim.</P>
            <P>(v) The property owner relied upon FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) that were current at the time the property was purchased, and the effective FIRM and associated Flood Insurance Study (FIS) did not indicate that the property was located in an area having special flood hazards. The property owner must produce the dated FIRM and FIS in effect at the time the property was purchased to support this claim.</P>
            <P>(vi) An alternative mitigation activity would be at least as cost effective as the offered mitigation activity. The property owner must submit documentation of the costs for a technically feasible and eligible alternative mitigation activity based on estimates from qualified appraisers, professional engineers, or registered architects, and information and documentation demonstrating the cost effectiveness using a FEMA approved methodology to support this claim.</P>
            <P>(2) The FEMA Regional Administrator will conduct an initial review of each appeal that is filed on a timely basis to determine if the appeal complies with this section and includes sufficient documentation to be evaluated. The Regional Administrator may reject an appeal on initial review if it is made on a basis other than those listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; if the property owner does not provide sufficient documentation, including, if applicable, supplemental information requested by the Regional Administrator by the deadline established by the Regional Administrator, which shall not exceed the timeframe described in paragraph (d) of this section; or if the appeal otherwise fails to comply with this section.</P>

            <P>(3) If, upon initial review, the Regional Administrator determines that the basis for the offered mitigation activity was erroneous on its face and the appeal can be resolved in favor of the property owner, the appeal will be closed and no insurance increase will apply to the property. All other cases <PRTPAGE P="266"/>will be referred to the Administrator for assignment to an independent third party for review. The independent third party shall make a final determination on each appeal within 90 days of the date on which FEMA receives the appeal. As a low cost option, the property owner may request that the Administrator substitute a reviewer from FEMA's Alternative Dispute Resolution Office for the independent third party.</P>
            <P>(4) A property owner who brings an appeal will be responsible for paying his/her attorneys' fees and costs to gather the necessary documentation and data to demonstrate the ground(s) for the appeal. Attorneys' fees and costs cannot be awarded by the independent third party.</P>
            <P>(5) If the property owner prevails on appeal, the independent third party shall require the Administrator to charge the risk premium rate for flood insurance coverage of the property at the amount paid prior to the mitigation offer, as adjusted by any other premium adjustments otherwise applicable to the property. If the independent third party hearing the appeal is compensated for such service, the NFIF shall bear the costs of such compensation.</P>
            <P>(6) If the property owner loses the appeal, the Administrator shall promptly increase the chargeable risk premium rate for flood insurance coverage of the property to the amount established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, and shall collect from the property owner the amount necessary to cover the stay of the applicability of such increased rates while the appeal was pending. If FEMA does not receive the additional premium by the date it is due, the amount of coverage will be reduced to match the amount of premium payment received. If the independent third party hearing the appeal is compensated for such service, the property owner shall bear the costs of such compensation.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 79.8</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Allowable costs.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> General policies for allowable costs are addressed in 2 CFR 200.101, 200.102, 200.400-200.475.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Eligible Management Costs</E>—(i) Grantee. States are eligible to receive management costs consisting of a maximum of 10 percent of the planning and project activities awarded to the State, each fiscal year under FMA and SRL, respectively. These costs must be included in the application to FEMA. An Indian tribal government applying directly to FEMA is eligible for management costs consisting of a maximum of 10 percent of grants awarded for planning and project activities under the SRL and FMA programs respectively.</P>
            <P>(ii) Subgrantee. Subapplicants may include a maximum of 5 percent of the total funds requested for their subapplication for management costs to support the implementation of their planning or project activity. These costs must be included in the subapplication to the State.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Indirect costs.</E> Indirect costs of administering the FMA and SRL programs are eligible as part of the 10 percent management costs for the grantee or the 5 percent management costs of the subgrantee, but in no case do they make the recipient eligible for additional management costs that exceed the caps identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, all costs must be in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Pre-award costs.</E> FEMA may fund eligible pre-award planning or project costs at its discretion and as funds are available. Grantees and subgrantees may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project or planning proposal. These costs can only be incurred during the open application period of the respective grant program. Costs associated with implementation of the activity but incurred prior to grant award are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be reimbursed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Duplication of benefits.</E> Grant funds may not duplicate benefits received by or available to applicants, subapplicants and project participants from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. Such individual or entity must notify the grantee and FEMA of all benefits that it receives or anticipates from <PRTPAGE P="267"/>other sources for the same purpose. FEMA will reduce the subgrant award by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Negligence or other tortious conduct.</E> FEMA grant funds are not available where an applicant, subapplicant, other project participant, or third party's negligence or intentional actions contributed to the conditions to be mitigated. If the applicant, subapplicant, or project participant suspects negligence or other tortious conduct by a third party for causing such condition, they are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the tortious conduct of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available for the same purpose, and will treat them consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) FEMA grant funds are not available to satisfy or reimburse for legal obligations, such as those imposed by a legal settlement, court order, or State law.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 79.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Grant administration.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Grantee must follow FEMA grant requirements, including submission of performance and financial status reports, and shall follow adequate competitive procurement procedures. In addition, grantees are responsible for ensuring that all subgrantees are aware of and follow the requirements contained in 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.</P>
            <P>(b) During the implementation of an approved grant, the State POC may find that actual costs are exceeding the approved award amount. While there is no guarantee of additional funding, FEMA will only consider requests made by the State POC to pay for such overruns if:</P>
            <P>(1) Funds are available to meet the requested increase in funding;</P>
            <P>(2) The amended grant award meets the cost-share requirements identified in this section; and</P>
            <P>(3) The total amount obligated to the State does not exceed the maximum funding amounts set in § 79.4(a)(2).</P>
            <P>(c) Grantees may use cost underruns from ongoing subgrants to offset overruns incurred by another subgrant(s) awarded under the same grant. All costs for which funding is requested must have been included in the original application's cost estimate.</P>
            <P>(d) For all cost overruns that exceed the amount approved under the grant, and which require additional Federal funds, the State POC shall submit a written request with a recommendation, including a justification for the additional funding to the Regional Administrator for a determination. If approved, the Regional Administrator shall increase the grant through an amendment to the original award document.</P>
            <P>(e) At the time of closeout, FEMA will recapture any funds provided to a State or a community under these programs if the applicant has not provided the appropriate matching funds, the approved project has not been completed within the timeframes specified in the grant agreement, or the completed project does not meet the criteria specified in this part.</P>

              <P>This part provides guidance on the administration of FEMA mitigation assistance for projects to acquire property for open space purposes under all FEMA hazard mitigation assistance programs. It provides information on the eligibility and procedures for implementing projects for acquisition and relocation of at-risk properties from the hazard area to maintain the property for open space purposes. This part applies to property acquisition for open space project awards made under any FEMA hazard mitigation assistance program. This part supplements general program requirements of the funding grant program and must be read in conjunction with the relevant program regulations and guidance available at <E T="03">http://www.fema.gov.</E>This part, with the exception of § 80.19 Land use and oversight, applies to projects for which the funding program application period opens or for which funding is made available pursuant to a major disaster declared on or after December 3, 2007. Prior to that date, applicable program regulations and guidance in effect for the funding program (available at <E T="03">http://www.fema.gov</E>) shall apply. Section 80.19 Land use and oversight apply as of December 3, 2007 to all FEMA funded acquisitions for the purpose of open space.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as noted in this part, the definitions applicable to the funding program apply to implementation of this part. In addition, for purposes of this part:</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicant</E> is the State or Indian tribal government applying to FEMA for a grant, and which will be accountable for the use of the funds.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grantee</E> means the State or Indian tribal government to which FEMA awards a grant and which is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity, even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Market Value</E> is generally defined as the amount in cash, or on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would have sold on the effective date of the valuation, after a reasonable exposure time on the open competitive market, from a willing and reasonably knowledgeable seller to a willing and reasonably knowledgeable buyer, with neither acting under any compulsion to buy or sell, giving due consideration to all available economic uses of the property at the time of the valuation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">National of the United States</E> means a person within the meaning of the term as defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. section 1101(a)(22).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Purchase offer</E> is the initial value assigned to the property, which is later adjusted by applicable additions and deductions, resulting in a final offer amount to a property owner.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Qualified alien</E> means a person within the meaning of the term as defined at 8 U.S.C. 1641.</P>

              <P>A project involving property acquisition or the relocation of structures for open space is eligible for hazard mitigation assistance only if the subapplicant meets the pre-award requirements set forth in this subpart. A project may not be framed in a manner that has the effect of circumventing the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible and ineligible costs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Allowable costs.</E> Eligible project costs may include compensation for the value of structures, for their relocation or demolition, for associated land, and associated costs. For land that is already held by an eligible entity, compensation for the land is not an allowable cost, but compensation for development rights may be allowable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Pre-award costs.</E> FEMA may fund eligible pre-award project costs at its discretion and as funds are available. Grantees and subgrantees may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project proposal. These costs can only be incurred during the open application period of the respective grant program. Costs associated with implementation of the project but incurred prior to grant award are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be reimbursed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Duplication of benefits.</E> Grant funds may not duplicate benefits received by <PRTPAGE P="271"/>or available to applicants, subapplicants and other project participants from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. Such individual or entity must notify the subapplicant and FEMA of all benefits that it receives, anticipates, or has available from other sources for the same purpose. FEMA will reduce the subgrant award by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Negligence or other tortious conduct.</E> FEMA acquisition funds are not available where an applicant, subapplicant, other project participant, or third party's negligence or intentional actions contributed to the conditions to be mitigated. If the applicant, subapplicant, or project participant suspects negligence or other tortious conduct by a third party for causing such condition, they are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the tortious conduct of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available for the same purpose, and will treat them consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) FEMA mitigation grant funds are not available to satisfy or reimburse for legal obligations, such as those imposed by a legal settlement, court order, or State law.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acquisition of improved properties.</E> Eligible properties are those with at-risk structures on the property, including those that are damaged or destroyed due to an event. In some cases, undeveloped, at-risk land adjacent to an eligible property with existing structures may be eligible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Subdivision restrictions.</E> The land may not be subdivided prior to acquisition except for portions outside the identified hazard area, such as the Special Flood Hazard Area or any risk zone identified by FEMA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Subapplicant property interest.</E> To be eligible, the subapplicant must acquire or retain fee title (full property interest), except for encumbrances FEMA determines are compatible with open space uses, as part of the project implementation. A pass through of funds from an eligible entity to an ineligible entity must not occur.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Hazardous materials.</E> Eligible properties include only those that are not contaminated with hazardous materials, except for incidental demolition and household hazardous waste.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Open space restrictions.</E> Property acquired or from which a structure is removed must be dedicated to and maintained as open space in perpetuity consistent with this part.</P>

              <P>(4) The documentation of voluntary interest signed by each property owner, which must include that the subapplicant has informed them in writing that it will not use its eminent domain authority for the open space purpose; and</P>

              <P>(5) Assurance that the subject property is not part of an intended, planned, or designated project area for which the land is to be acquired by a certain date, and that local and State governments have no intention to use the property for any public or private facility in the future inconsistent with this part;<PRTPAGE P="272"/>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultation regarding other ongoing Federal activities.</E> (1) The subapplicant must demonstrate that it has consulted with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) regarding the subject land's potential future use for the construction of a levee system. The subapplicant must also demonstrate that it has, and will, reject any future consideration of such use if it accepts FEMA assistance to convert the property to permanent open space.</P>
              <P>(2) The subapplicant must demonstrate that it has coordinated with its State Department of Transportation to ensure that no future, planned modifications, improvements, or enhancements to Federal aid systems are under consideration that will affect the subject property.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restriction on alternate properties.</E> Changes to the properties in an approved mitigation project will be considered by FEMA but not approved automatically. The subapplicant must identify the alternate properties in the project application and each alternate property must meet eligibility requirements in order to be considered.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Hazardous materials.</E> The subgrantee shall take steps to ensure it does not acquire or include in the project properties contaminated with hazardous materials by seeking information from property owners and from other sources on the use and presence of contaminants affecting the property from owners of properties that are or were industrial or commercial, or adjacent to such. A contaminated property must be certified clean prior to participation. This excludes permitted disposal of incidental demolition and household hazardous wastes. FEMA mitigation grant funds may not be used for clean up or remediation of contaminated properties.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Clear title.</E> The subgrantee will obtain a title insurance policy demonstrating that fee title conveys to the subgrantee for each property to ensure that it acquires only a property with clear title. The property interest generally must transfer by a general warranty deed. Any incompatible easements or other encumbrances to the property must be extinguished before acquisition.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Purchase offer and supplemental payments.</E> (1) The amount of purchase offer is the current market value of the property or the market value of the property immediately before the relevant event affecting the property (“pre-event”).</P>
              <P>(i) The relevant event for Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act assistance under HMGP is the major disaster under which funds are available; for assistance under the Pre-disaster Mitigation program (PDM) (42 U.S.C. 5133), it is the most recent major disaster. Where multiple disasters have affected the same property, the grantee and subgrantee shall determine which is the relevant event.</P>
              <P>(ii) The relevant event for assistance under the National Flood Insurance Act is the most recent event resulting in a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claim of at least $5000.</P>

              <P>(2) For acquisition of properties under the Severe Repetitive Loss program under part 79 of this subchapter, the purchase offer is not less than the greatest of the amount in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; the original purchase price paid by the participating property owner holding the flood insurance policy; or the outstanding amount of any loan to the participating property owner, which is secured by a recorded interest in the property at the time of the purchase offer.<PRTPAGE P="273"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The grantee should coordinate with the subgrantee in their determination of whether the valuation should be based on pre-event or current market value. Generally, the same method to determine market value should be used for all participants in the project.</P>
              <P>(4) A property owner who did not own the property at the time of the relevant event, or who is not a National of the United States or qualified alien, is not eligible for a purchase offer based on pre-event market value of the property. Subgrantees who offer pre-event market value to the property owner must have already obtained certification during the application process that the property owner is either a National of the United States or a qualified alien.</P>
              <P>(5) Certain tenants who must relocate as a result of the project are entitled to relocation benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (such as moving expenses, replacement housing rental payments, and relocation assistance advisory services) in accordance with 49 CFR part 24.</P>
              <P>(6) If a purchase offer for a residential property is less than the cost of the homeowner-occupant to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling outside the hazard-prone area in the same community, the subgrantee for funding under the Severe Repetitive Loss program implemented at part 79 of this subchapter shall make available a supplemental payment to the homeowner-occupant to apply to the difference. Subgrantees for other mitigation grant programs may make such a payment available in accordance with criteria determined by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(7) The subgrantee must inform each property owner, in writing, of what it considers to be the market value of the property, the method of valuation and basis for the purchase offer, and the final offer amount. The offer will also clearly state that the property owner's participation in the project is voluntary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Removal of Existing Buildings.</E> Existing incompatible facilities must be removed by demolition or by relocation outside of the hazard area within 90 days of settlement of the property transaction. The FEMA Regional Administrator may grant an exception to this deadline only for a particular property based upon written justification if extenuating circumstances exist, but shall specify a final date for removal.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Deed Restriction.</E> The subgrantee, upon settlement of the property transaction, shall record with the deed of the subject property notice of applicable land use restrictions and related procedures described in this part, consistent with FEMA model deed restriction language.</P>

              <P>This section applies to acquisitions for open space projects to address flood hazards. If the Administrator determines to mitigate in other circumstances, he/she will adapt the provisions of this section as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Open space requirements.</E> The property shall be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity as open space for the conservation of natural floodplain functions.</P>
              <P>(1) These uses may include: Parks for outdoor recreational activities; wetlands management; nature reserves; cultivation; grazing; camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation); unimproved, unpaved parking lots; buffer zones; and other uses FEMA determines compatible with this part.</P>
              <P>(i) Allowable uses generally do not include: Walled buildings, levees, dikes, or floodwalls, paved roads, highways, bridges, cemeteries, landfills, storage of any hazardous or toxic materials, above or below ground pumping and switching stations, above or below ground storage tanks, paved parking, off-site fill or other uses that obstruct the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain.</P>

              <P>(ii) In the rare circumstances where the Administrator has determined competing Federal interests were unavoidable and has analyzed floodplain impacts for compliance with § 60.3 of this subchapter or higher standards, the Administrator may find only USACE projects recognized by FEMA <PRTPAGE P="274"/>in 2000 and improvements to pre-existing Federal-aid transportation systems to be allowable uses.</P>
              <P>(2) No new structures or improvements will be built on the property except as indicated below:</P>
              <P>(i) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;</P>
              <P>(ii) A public restroom; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A structure that is compatible with open space and conserves the natural function of the floodplain, which the Administrator approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.</P>
              <P>(3) Any improvements on the property shall be in accordance with proper floodplain management policies and practices. Structures built on the property according to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be floodproofed or elevated to at least the base flood level plus 1 foot of freeboard, or greater, if required by FEMA, or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(4) After the date of property settlement, no Federal entity or source may provide disaster assistance for any purpose with respect to the property, nor may any application for such assistance be made to any Federal entity or source.</P>
              <P>(5) The property is not eligible for coverage under the NFIP for damage to structures on the property occurring after the date of the property settlement, except for pre-existing structures being relocated off the property as a result of the project.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Subsequent transfer.</E> After acquiring the property interest, the subgrantee, including successors in interest, shall convey any interest in the property only if the Regional Administrator, through the State, gives prior written approval of the transferee in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) The request by the subgrantee, through the State, to the Regional Administrator must include a signed statement from the proposed transferee that it acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the terms of this section, and documentation of its status as a qualified conservation organization if applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) The subgrantee may convey a property interest only to a public entity or to a qualified conservation organization. However, the subgrantee may convey an easement or lease to a private individual or entity for purposes compatible with the uses described in paragraph (a), of this section, with the prior approval of the Regional Administrator, and so long as the conveyance does not include authority to control and enforce the terms and conditions of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If title to the property is transferred to a public entity other than one with a conservation mission, it must be conveyed subject to a conservation easement that shall be recorded with the deed and shall incorporate all terms and conditions set forth in this section, including the easement holder's responsibility to enforce the easement. This shall be accomplished by one of the following means:</P>
              <P>(i) The subgrantee shall convey, in accordance with this paragraph, a conservation easement to an entity other than the title holder, which shall be recorded with the deed, or</P>
              <P>(ii) At the time of title transfer, the subgrantee shall retain such conservation easement, and record it with the deed.</P>
              <P>(4) Conveyance of any property interest must reference and incorporate the original deed restrictions providing notice of the conditions in this section and must incorporate a provision for the property interest to revert to the subgrantee or grantee in the event that the transferee ceases to exist or loses its eligible status under this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> FEMA, its representatives and assigns, including the grantee shall have the right to enter upon the property, at reasonable times and with reasonable notice, for the purpose of inspecting the property to ensure compliance with the terms of this part, the property conveyance and of the grant award.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Monitoring and reporting.</E> Every 3 years the subgrantee (in coordination with any current successor in interest) through the grantee, shall submit to the FEMA Regional Administrator a report certifying that the subgrantee <PRTPAGE P="275"/>has inspected the property within the month preceding the report, and that the property continues to be maintained consistent with the provisions of this part, the property conveyance and the grant award.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> The subgrantee, grantee, FEMA, and their respective representatives, successors and assigns, are responsible for taking measures to bring the property back into compliance if the property is not maintained according to the terms of this part, the conveyance, and the grant award. The relative rights and responsibilities of FEMA, the grantee, the subgrantee, and subsequent holders of the property interest at the time of enforcement, shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The grantee will notify the subgrantee and any current holder of the property interest in writing and advise them that they have 60 days to correct the violation.</P>
              <P>(i) If the subgrantee or any current holder of the property interest fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to come into compliance with the terms of the grant within the 60-day period, the grantee shall enforce the terms of the grant by taking any measures it deems appropriate, including but not limited to bringing an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(ii) FEMA, its representatives, and assignees may enforce the terms of the grant by taking any measures it deems appropriate, including but not limited to 1 or more of the following:</P>

Section 11 requires that certain payments be deducted from those costs and that the Treasury Department will ordinarily pay the amount resulting from the application of that formula. Where the United States has entered into a contract (which is not a mutual aid agreement, defined in § 151.03) for the provision of fire protection, and it is the intent of the parties that reimbursement under section 11 is unavailable, this intent will normally govern. Where a mutual aid agreement is in effect between the claimant and an agency of the United States for the property upon which the fire occurred, reimbursement will be available in otherwise proper situations. However, any payments (including the value of services) rendered under the agreement during the term of the agreement (or the Federal fiscal year in which the fire occurred, if no term is discernible) shall be deducted from the costs claimed, pursuant to § 151.12.</P>

              <P>Any fire service in any State which believes it has a claim(s) cognizable under section 11 shall submit its claim(s) in writing within 90 days of the occurrence of the fire(s) for which a claim(s) is made. If the fire is of such duration that the claimant desires to <PRTPAGE P="282"/>submit a claim before its conclusion, it may do so, but only for the eligible costs actually incurred to date. Additional claims may be filed for costs later incurred. Claims shall be submitted to the Administrator, FEMA, Washington, DC, 20472. Each claim shall include the following information:</P>

              <P>(d) Proof of authority to fight the fire (source of alarm, whether fire service was requested by responsible Federal official or whether such an official accepted the assistance when offered);</P>
              <P>(e) Personnel and equipment committed to fighting of fire (type of equipment and number of items); and an itemized list of direct expenses (e.g., hours of equipment operation, fuel costs, consumables, overtime pay and wages for any specially hired personnel) and direct losses (e.g., damaged or destroyed equipment, to include purchase cost, estimate of the cost of repairs, statement of depreciated value immediately preceding and subsequent to the damage or destruction and the extent of insurance coverage) actually incurred in fighting the fire. A statement should be included explaining why each such expense or loss is considered by the claimant not be a normal operating cost, or to be in excess of normal operating costs;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of amount authorized for payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator shall determine the amount to be paid on a claim (subject to payment by the Department of the Treasury). The amount to be paid is the total of eligible expenses, costs and losses under paragraph (a)(1) of this section which exceeds the amount of payments under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The Administrator shall establish the reimbursable amount by determining:</P>
              <P>(1) The extent to which the fire service incurred additional firefighting costs, over and above its normal operating costs, in connection with the fire which is the subject of the claim, i.e., the “amount of costs”; and</P>
              <P>(2) What payments, if any, including taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, the fire service or its parent jurisdiction has received from the United States for the support of fire services on the property on which the fire occurred.</P>

              <FP>The reimbursable amount is the amount, if any, by which the amount of costs, determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount of payments determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Where more than one claim is filed the aggregate reimbursable amount is the amount by which the total amount of costs, determined under paragraph <PRTPAGE P="283"/>(a)(1) of this section exceed the amount of Federal payments (in the case of a mutual aid agreement—its term or if none is determinable, the Federal fiscal year) determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</FP>
              <P>(b) The Administrator will first determine the costs as contemplated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will then notify the claimant as to that amount. The claimant must indicate within 30 days its acceptance or rejection of that amount.</P>
              <P>(1) If the determination is accepted by the claimant, this will be the final and conclusive determination of the amount of costs by the claimant in conjunction with the fire for which the claims are submitted.</P>
              <P>(2) If the claimant rejects this amount, it must notify the Administrator, within 30 days, of its reasons for its rejection. Upon receipt of notification of rejection, the Administrator shall reconsider his determination and notify the claimant of the results of the reconsideration. The amount determined on reconsideration will constitute the costs to be used by the Administrator in determining the reimbursable amount.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon receipt of documentation from the claimant on the amount of payments the Federal Government has made for the support of fire services on the property in question, the Administrator will, following such verification or investigation as the Administrator may deem appropriate, calculate the full amount to be reimbursed under the section 11 formula as set forth in § 151.12(a). This calculation of the reimbursable amount is based upon the costs determined pursuant to § 151.12(b) and the documentation of Federal payments that the claimant submitted.</P>
              <P>(d) The Administrator's determination of the reimbursable amount will be sent to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon receipt of the claim and determination made under § 151.12 (a), (b), and (c), determine the amount authorized for payment, which shall be the amount actually available for payment from any monies in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated but subject to reimbursement (from any appropriations which may be available or which may be made available for the purpose) by the Federal department or agency under whose jurisdiction the fire occurred. This shall be a sum no greater, although it may be less, that the reimbursable amount determined by the Administrator, FEMA, with respect to the claim under § 151.12 (a), (b) and (c).</P>
              <P>(e) Upon receipt of written notification from the claimant of its intention to accept the amount authorized as full settlement of the claim, accompanied by a properly executed document of release, the Administrator will forward the claim, a copy of the Administrator's determination and the claimant's document of release to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of the claim in the amount authorized.</P>
              <P>(f) Subject to the discovery of additional material evidence, the Administrator may reconsider any determination in this section, whether or not made as his final determination.</P>

              <P>(a) If the claimant elects to protest the amount authorized for payment, after the applicable procedures of § 151.12 have been followed, it must within 30 days of receipt of notification of the amount authorized notify the Administrator in writing of its objections and set forth the reasons why the Administrator should reconsider the determination. The Administrator will upon notice of protest and receipt of additional evidence reconsider the determination of the amount of Federal payments under § 151.12(a)(2) but not the determination of the amount of costs under § 151.12(a)(1). The Administrator shall cause a reconsideration by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount actually available and authorized for payment by the Treasury. The Administrator, upon receipt of the Secretary of the Treasury's reconsidered determination, will notify the claimant in writing of the amount authorized, upon reconsideration, for payment in full settlement of the claim.</P>

              <P>(b) If the claimant elects to accept the amount authorized, upon reconsideration, for payment in full settlement <PRTPAGE P="284"/>of its claims, it must within 30 days (or a longer period of time acceptable to the Administrator) of its receipt of that determination notify the Administrator of its acceptance in writing accompanied by a properly executed document of release. Upon receipt of such notice and document of release, the Administrator will forward the claim, a copy of the Administrator's final determination, and the claimant's document of release to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of the claim in the amount of final authorization.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and eligible uses of grant funds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This competitive grant program will provide funding directly to fire departments of a State for the purpose of enhancing departments abilities to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of firefighting personnel, facing fire and fire-related hazards. Eligible applicants can submit only one application per application period. Departments that submit multiple applications in one application period will have each of their applications deemed ineligible.</P>

            <P>(b) Eligible applicants are fire departments or fire departments of a State which is defined as an agency or organization that has a “formally recognized arrangement” with a State, local or tribal authority (city, county, parish, fire district, township, town, or other non-Federal governing body) to provide fire suppression services within a fixed geographical area. A fire department can apply for assistance for its emergency medical services unit provided the unit falls organizationally under the auspices of the fire department. A municipality or fire district may submit an application on behalf of a fire department when the fire department lacks the legal status to do so, e.g., where the fire department falls <PRTPAGE P="285"/>within the auspices of the municipality. When a municipality or fire district submits an application on behalf of a fire department, the fire department is precluded from submitting an additional application. Non-Federal airport and/or port authority fire departments are eligible, but only if they have a formally recognized arrangement with the local jurisdiction to provide fire suppression, on a first-due basis, outside the confines of the airport or port facilities. Airport or port authority fire departments whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on the airport grounds or port facilities are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments that are Federal or contracted by the Federal government and whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on Federal installations are not eligible for this grant program. Fire stations that are not independent but are part of, or controlled by a larger fire department or agency, are typically not eligible. Fire departments that are for-profit departments (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> do not have specific non-profit status or are not municipally based) are not eligible to apply for assistance under this program. Also not eligible for this program are ambulance services, rescue squads, auxiliaries, dive teams, urban search and rescue teams, fire service organizations or associations, and State/local agencies such as a forest service, fire marshal, hospitals, and training offices.</P>
            <P>(c) Congress included in the legislation a list of fourteen activities eligible for funding under this program. Those activities are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) To hire additional firefighting personnel;</P>
            <P>(2) To train firefighting personnel in firefighting, emergency response (including response to a terrorism incident or use of a weapon of mass destruction), arson prevention and detection, or the handling of hazardous materials, or to train firefighting personnel to provide any of the training in this paragraph (c);</P>
            <P>(3) To fund the creation of rapid intervention teams to protect firefighting personnel at scenes of fires and other emergencies;</P>
            <P>(4) To certify fire inspectors;</P>
            <P>(5) To establish wellness and fitness programs for firefighting personnel to ensure that the firefighting personnel can carry out their duties;</P>
            <P>(6) To fund emergency medical services provided by fire departments;</P>
            <P>(7) To acquire additional firefighting vehicles, including fire trucks;</P>
            <P>(8) To acquire additional firefighting equipment, including equipment for communications, monitoring, and response to a terrorism incident or use of a weapon of mass destruction;</P>
            <P>(9) To acquire personal protective equipment required for firefighting personnel by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other personal protective equipment for firefighting personnel, including protective equipment to respond to a terrorism incident or the use of a weapon of mass destruction;</P>
            <P>(10) To modify fire stations, fire training facilities, and other facilities to protect the health and safety of firefighting personnel;</P>
            <P>(11) To enforce fire codes;</P>
            <P>(12) To fund fire prevention programs;</P>
            <P>(13) To educate the public about arson prevention and detection; and</P>
            <P>(14) To provide incentives for the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighting personnel for volunteer firefighting departments and other firefighting departments that utilize volunteers.</P>
            <P>(d) The specific activities that will be eligible for funding will be announced in the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) that we will publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.</P>

              <E T="03">Fire department or fire department of a State</E> is an agency or organization that has a “formally recognized arrangement” with a State, local or tribal authority (city, county, parish, fire district, township, town, or other non-Federal governing body) to provide fire suppression services within a fixed geographical area. A fire department can apply for assistance for its emergency medical services unit provided the unit falls organizationally under the auspices of the fire department. A municipality or fire district may submit an application on behalf of a fire department when the fire department lacks the legal status to do so, e.g., where the fire department falls within the auspices of the municipality. When a municipality or fire district submits an application on behalf of a fire department, the fire department is precluded from submitting an additional application. Non-Federal airport and/or port authority fire departments are eligible, but only if they have a formally recognized arrangement with the local jurisdiction to provide fire suppression services, on a first-due basis, outside the confines of the airport or port facilities. Airport or port authority fire departments whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on the airport grounds or port facilities are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments that are Federal or contracted by the Federal government and whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on Federal installations are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments or fire stations that are not independent but are part of, or controlled by a larger fire department or agency, are typically not eligible. Fire departments that are for-profit departments (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> do not have specific non-profit status or are not municipally based) are not eligible to apply for assistance under this program. Also not eligible for this program are ambulance services, rescue squads, auxiliaries, dive teams, urban search and rescue teams, fire service organizations or associations, and State/local agencies such as a forest service, fire marshal, hospitals, and training offices.</P>

            <P>(a) Fire departments that have received funding under the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program in previous years are eligible to apply for funding in the current year. However, due to our responsibilities under this program to assure adequate distribution of awards amongst certain types of departments (career, combination and volunteer) and certain types of communities (urban, suburban or rural) as well as an equitable geographic distribution, we reserve the right to fund or not to fund previous recipients of grants under this program in order for us to fulfill these responsibilities.</P>

            <P>(c) No applicant can submit more than one application per fiscal year. Applicants that submit multiple applications will have each of their applications deemed ineligible.</P>
            <P>(d) The scoring of the applications will determine the distribution of the funding across the eligible programs. Notwithstanding anything in this part, no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the funds appropriated for grants shall be used to assist grant recipients to purchase firefighting vehicles and not less than five (5) percent of the funds shall be used for fire prevention programs.</P>
            <P>(e) We will not provide assistance under this part for activities for which another Federal agency has more specific or primary authority to provide assistance for the same purpose. We may disallow or recoup amounts that fall within other Federal agency's authority.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review process and evaluation criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Every application will be evaluated based on the answers to the activity-specific questions during our initial screening. The applications that are determined to best address the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program's established priorities during this initial screening will be in the “competitive range” and subject to a second level of review. We will use the narratives/supplemental information provided by the applicants in their grant applications to evaluate, on a competitive basis, the merits and benefits of each request for funding. In selecting applications for award, we will evaluate each application for assistance independently based on established eligibility criteria and the program priorities. Eligible applicants that best address the priorities will advance to a second level of review. The second level of review involves an assessment of the financial needs of the applicant, and an analysis of the benefits that would result from the grant award.</P>
            <P>(b) In order to be successful at this second level of the evaluation, an applicant must complete the narrative section of the application package. The narrative should include a detailed description of the planned program, uses for the grant funds including details of each budget line item. For example, if personnel costs are included in the budget, please provide a break down of what those costs are for. The narrative should explain why the grant funds are needed and why the department has not been able to obtain funding for the planned activities on its own. A discussion of financial need should include a discussion of any Federal funding received for similar activities. Finally, the applicant's narrative should detail the benefits the department or community will realize as a result of the grant award.</P>

            <P>(c) This second level of review will be conducted using a panel of technical evaluation panelists. These panelists are largely made up of non-Federal experts with a fire service background. The panelists will assess the application's merits with respect to the clarity and detail provided in the narrative <PRTPAGE P="290"/>about the project, the applicant's financial need, and the project's purported benefit to be derived from the cost. Technical evaluation panelists will independently score each application before them and then discuss the merits/shortcomings of the application in an effort to reconcile any major discrepancies. A consensus on the score is not required. The highest scoring applications resulting from this second level of review will then be considered for award. We seek to maximize the benefits derived from the funding by crediting applicants with the greatest financial need and whose proposed activities provide the greatest benefit versus the cost.</P>
            <P>(d) In addition to the project narrative, the applicant must provide an itemized budget detailing the use of the grant funds. If an applicant is seeking funds in more than one eligible activity within a program, separate budgets will have to be generated for each activity and then an overall or summary budget will have to be generated. For those applicants applying on line, the summary budget will be automatically generated by the e-grants system.</P>
            <P>(e) Specific rating criteria for each of the eligible programs will be published in a Notice of Funding Availability that we will publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application review and award process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As stated in § 152.5, we will evaluate each application in the preliminary screening process to determine which applications best address the program's established priorities. The best applications as determined in this preliminary step will be deemed to be in the “competitive range.” All applications in the competitive range will advance to a second level review by a technical evaluation panel. Using the evaluation criteria detailed in the Program Guidance and in the NOFA (both of which are published pursuant to this program's annual appropriation), the panelists will score each application they evaluate. The assigned score will reflect the degree to which the applicant: clearly relates their proposed project; demonstrates financial need; and, details a high benefit to cost value of the proposed activities. We will provide the panelists the complete application content for their evaluation. We will also provide them with reference materials for national standards or regulations and guidelines with respect to typical costs for proposed apparatus and equipment purchases.</P>

            <P>(b) Our award decisions will be based on the stated priorities of the grant program first, then on the demonstrated need of the applicant and the benefits to be derived from the proposed projects. We will make awards on a competitive basis, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> we will fund the highest scored applications before considering lower scored applications.</P>
            <P>(c) In a few cases, to fulfill our obligations under the law to make grants to a variety of departments, we may also make funding decisions using rank order as the preliminary basis, and then analyze the type of fire department (paid, volunteer, or combination fire departments), the size and character of the community it serves (urban, suburban, or rural), and/or the geographic location of the fire department. In these instances where we are making decisions based on geographic location, we will use States as the basic geographic unit. We may also base our funding decisions on previous grant awards funded by this program and/or grantees' performance on previous grants and a technical evaluation of reasonable costs for labor, services, materials or equipment.</P>

            <P>(a) Grantees will have twelve months to incur obligations and complete the scope of work to fulfill their responsibilities under this grant program. The performance period of each grant will be detailed in the Articles of Agreement that we provide each grantee. Grantees may request funds from FEMA as reimbursement for expenditures made under the grant program or they may request funds for immediate cash needs under 2 CFR 200.305. Advances of funds may also be approved to meet immediate cash needs.</P>

            <P>(b) Generally, fire departments cannot use grant funds to pay for products and services contracted for, or purchased prior to the effective date of the <PRTPAGE P="291"/>grant. However, we will consider requests for reimbursement for these on an exception basis. Expenses incurred after the application deadline but prior to award may be eligible for reimbursement if the expenses were justified, unavoidable (i.e., urgent and compelling), consistent with the scope of work, and specifically approved by the Assistance Officer. Expenses, obligations, commitments or contracts incurred or entered into prior to the application deadline are not eligible to be included as an expense.</P>
            <P>(c) All grantees must follow their own established procurement process when buying anything with Federal grant funds as provided in 2 CFR 200.317-200.326. If the grantee does not have an established procurement process, they must seek a minimum of two bids for any acquisition.</P>
            <P>(d) When requesting funding, grantees can only request an amount that is necessary to satisfy their immediate cash needs directly related to the grant, i.e., an amount equal to the total eligible grant expenses due within 30 days. Grantees can request payments of up to one hundred (100) percent of the federal share of the award amount but only if delivery of the ordered products and/or services is imminent (approximately 30 days) and the resulting payment will require the entire amount of funds.</P>
            <P>(e) A grantee may request sufficient funding for a down payment if required to do so by the seller, such as in grants involving some purchases of firefighting vehicles. The grantee may request as much as fifty (50) percent of the federal share of the award amount at the time of the order placement to pay the down payment. The grantee may request the balance of the federal share upon delivery of the ordered equipment or vehicle.</P>
            <P>(f) The recipients of funding under this program must report to us on how the grant funding was used and the benefits that resulted. This will be accomplished via submission of performance reports. Details regarding the reporting requirements will be provided in the Articles of Agreement provided to each grantee.</P>
            <P>(g) Fire departments that receive funding under this program must agree to provide information to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for the period covered by the assistance. If a grantee does not currently participate in the incident reporting system and does not have the capacity to report at the time of the award, that grantee must agree to provide information to the system for a twelve-month period commencing as soon as possible after they develop the capacity to report. Capacity to report to the NFIRS must be established prior to the termination of the one-year performance period.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk assessments</E> that provide the factual basis for activities proposed in the strategy portion of the mitigation plan. Statewide risk assessments must characterize and analyze natural hazards and risks to provide a statewide overview. This overview will allow the State to compare potential losses throughout the State and to determine their priorities for implementing mitigation measures under the strategy, and to prioritize jurisdictions for receiving technical and financial support in developing more detailed local risk and vulnerability assessments. The risk assessment shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) An overview of the type and location of all natural hazards that can affect the State, including information on previous occurrences of hazard events, as well as the probability of future hazard events, using maps where appropriate;</P>
            <P>(ii) An overview and analysis of the State's vulnerability to the hazards described in this paragraph (c)(2), based on estimates provided in local risk assessments as well as the State risk assessment. The State shall describe vulnerability in terms of the jurisdictions most threatened by the identified hazards, and most vulnerable to damage and loss associated with hazard events. State owned or operated critical facilities located in the identified hazard areas shall also be addressed;</P>
            <P>(iii) An overview and analysis of potential losses to the identified vulnerable structures, based on estimates provided in local risk assessments as well as the State risk assessment. The State shall estimate the potential dollar losses to State owned or operated buildings, infrastructure, and critical facilities located in the identified hazard areas.</P>
            <P>(3) A <E T="03">Mitigation Strategy</E> that provides the State's blueprint for reducing the losses identified in the risk assessment. This section shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of State goals to guide the selection of activities to mitigate and reduce potential losses.</P>
            <P>(ii) A discussion of the State's pre- and post-disaster hazard management policies, programs, and capabilities to mitigate the hazards in the area, including: an evaluation of State laws, regulations, policies, and programs related to hazard mitigation as well as to development in hazard-prone areas; a discussion of State funding capabilities for hazard mitigation projects; and a general description and analysis of the effectiveness of local mitigation policies, programs, and capabilities.</P>

            <P>(iii) An identification, evaluation, and prioritization of cost-effective, environmentally sound, and technically feasible mitigation actions and activities the State is considering and an explanation of how each activity contributes to the overall mitigation strategy. This section should be linked to local <PRTPAGE P="297"/>plans, where specific local actions and projects are identified.</P>
            <P>(iv) Identification of current and potential sources of Federal, State, local, or private funding to implement mitigation activities.</P>
            <P>(v) A State may request the reduced cost share authorized under § 79.4(c)(2) of this chapter for the FMA and SRL programs, if it has an approved State Mitigation Plan meeting the requirements of this section that also identifies specific actions the State has taken to reduce the number of repetitive loss properties (which must include severe repetitive loss properties), and specifies how the State intends to reduce the number of such repetitive loss properties. In addition, the plan must describe the strategy the State has to ensure that local jurisdictions with severe repetitive loss properties take actions to reduce the number of these properties, including the development of local mitigation plans.</P>
            <P>(4) A section on the <E T="03">Coordination of Local Mitigation Planning</E> that includes the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of the State process to support, through funding and technical assistance, the development of local mitigation plans.</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the State process and timeframe by which the local plans will be reviewed, coordinated, and linked to the State Mitigation Plan.</P>
            <P>(iii) Criteria for prioritizing communities and local jurisdictions that would receive planning and project grants under available funding programs, which should include consideration for communities with the highest risks, repetitive loss properties, and most intense development pressures. Further, that for non-planning grants, a principal criterion for prioritizing grants shall be the extent to which benefits are maximized according to a cost benefit review of proposed projects and their associated costs.</P>
            <P>(5) A <E T="03">Plan Maintenance Process</E> that includes:</P>
            <P>(i) An established method and schedule for monitoring, evaluating, and updating the plan.</P>
            <P>(ii) A system for monitoring implementation of mitigation measures and project closeouts.</P>
            <P>(iii) A system for reviewing progress on achieving goals as well as activities and projects identified in the Mitigation Strategy.</P>
            <P>(6) A <E T="03">Plan Adoption Process.</E> The plan must be formally adopted by the State prior to submittal to us for final review and approval.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Assurances.</E> The plan must include assurances that the State will comply with all applicable Federal statutes and regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives grant funding, including 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002. The State will amend its plan whenever necessary to reflect changes in State or Federal statutes and regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Review and updates.</E> Plan must be reviewed and revised to reflect changes in development, progress in statewide mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities and resubmitted for approval to the appropriate Regional Administrator every 5 years. The Regional review will be completed within 45 days after receipt from the State, whenever possible. We also encourage a State to review its plan in the post-disaster timeframe to reflect changing priorities, but it is not required.</P>

            <P>(2) Plans prepared for the FMA program, described at part 79 of this chapter, need only address these requirements as they relate to flood hazards in order to be eligible for FMA project grants. However, these plans must be clearly identified as being flood mitigation plans, and they will not meet the eligibility criteria for other mitigation grant programs, unless flooding is the only natural hazard the jurisdiction faces.</P>
            <P>(3) Regional Administrator's may grant an exception to the plan requirement in extraordinary circumstances, such as in a small and impoverished community, when justification is provided. In these cases, a plan will be completed within 12 months of the award of the project grant. If a plan is not provided within this timeframe, the project grant will be terminated, and any costs incurred after notice of grant's termination will not be reimbursed by FEMA.</P>
            <P>(4) Multi-jurisdictional plans (<E T="03">e.g.</E> watershed plans) may be accepted, as appropriate, as long as each jurisdiction has participated in the process and has officially adopted the plan. State-wide plans will not be accepted as multi-jurisdictional plans.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Planning process.</E> An open public involvement process is essential to the development of an effective plan. In order to develop a more comprehensive approach to reducing the effects of natural disasters, the planning process shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) An opportunity for the public to comment on the plan during the drafting stage and prior to plan approval;</P>
            <P>(2) An opportunity for neighboring communities, local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, and agencies that have the authority to regulate development, as well as businesses, academia and other private and non-profit interests to be involved in the planning process; and</P>
            <P>(3) Review and incorporation, if appropriate, of existing plans, studies, reports, and technical information.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Plan content.</E> The plan shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Documentation of the <E T="03">planning process</E> used to develop the plan, including how it was prepared, who was involved in the process, and how the public was involved.</P>
            <P>(2) A <E T="03">risk assessment</E> that provides the factual basis for activities proposed in the strategy to reduce losses from identified hazards. Local risk assessments must provide sufficient information to enable the jurisdiction to identify and prioritize appropriate mitigation actions to reduce losses from identified hazards. The risk assessment shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of the type, location, and extent of all natural hazards that can affect the jurisdiction. The plan shall include information on previous occurrences of hazard events and on the probability of future hazard events.</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the jurisdiction's vulnerability to the hazards described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. This description shall include an overall summary of each hazard and its impact on the community. All plans approved after October 1, 2008 must also address NFIP insured structures that have been repetitively damaged by floods. The plan should describe vulnerability in terms of:</P>
            <P>(A) The types and numbers of existing and future buildings, infrastructure, and critical facilities located in the identified hazard areas;</P>

            <P>(B) An estimate of the potential dollar losses to vulnerable structures identified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of <PRTPAGE P="300"/>this section and a description of the methodology used to prepare the estimate;</P>
            <P>(C) Providing a general description of land uses and development trends within the community so that mitigation options can be considered in future land use decisions.</P>
            <P>(iii) For multi-jurisdictional plans, the risk assessment section must assess each jurisdiction's risks where they vary from the risks facing the entire planning area.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">A mitigation strategy</E> that provides the jurisdiction's blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the risk assessment, based on existing authorities, policies, programs and resources, and its ability to expand on and improve these existing tools. This section shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of mitigation goals to reduce or avoid long-term vulnerabilities to the identified hazards.</P>
            <P>(ii) A section that identifies and analyzes a comprehensive range of specific mitigation actions and projects being considered to reduce the effects of each hazard, with particular emphasis on new and existing buildings and infrastructure. All plans approved by FEMA after October 1, 2008, must also address the jurisdiction's participation in the NFIP, and continued compliance with NFIP requirements, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(iii) An action plan describing how the actions identified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section will be prioritized, implemented, and administered by the local jurisdiction. Prioritization shall include a special emphasis on the extent to which benefits are maximized according to a cost benefit review of the proposed projects and their associated costs.</P>
            <P>(iv) For multi-jurisdictional plans, there must be identifiable action items specific to the jurisdiction requesting FEMA approval or credit of the plan.</P>
            <P>(4) A <E T="03">plan maintenance process</E> that includes:</P>
            <P>(i) A section describing the method and schedule of monitoring, evaluating, and updating the mitigation plan within a five-year cycle.</P>
            <P>(ii) A process by which local governments incorporate the requirements of the mitigation plan into other planning mechanisms such as comprehensive or capital improvement plans, when appropriate.</P>
            <P>(iii) Discussion on how the community will continue public participation in the plan maintenance process.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Documentation</E> that the plan has been formally adopted by the governing body of the jurisdiction requesting approval of the plan (e.g., City Council, County Commissioner, Tribal Council). For multi-jurisdictional plans, each jurisdiction requesting approval of the plan must document that it has been formally adopted.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Plan review.</E> (1) Plans must be submitted to the State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO) for initial review and coordination. The State will then send the plan to the appropriate FEMA Regional Office for formal review and approval. Where the State point of contact for the FMA program is different from the SHMO, the SHMO will be responsible for coordinating the local plan reviews between the FMA point of contact and FEMA.</P>
            <P>(2) The Regional review will be completed within 45 days after receipt from the State, whenever possible.</P>
            <P>(3) A local jurisdiction must review and revise its plan to reflect changes in development, progress in local mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities, and resubmit it for approval within 5 years in order to continue to be eligible for mitigation project grant funding.</P>
            <P>(4) Managing States that have been approved under the criteria established by FEMA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5170c(c) will be delegated approval authority for local mitigation plans, and the review will be based on the criteria in this part. Managing States will review the plans within 45 days of receipt of the plans, whenever possible, and provide a copy of the approved plans to the Regional Office.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Duplication of benefits.</E> FEMA provides supplementary assistance under the Stafford Act, which generally may not duplicate benefits received by or available to the applicant from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. An applicant must notify FEMA of all benefits that it receives or anticipates from other sources for the same purpose, and must seek all such benefits available to them. FEMA will reduce the grant by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source. FEMA may provide assistance under this Part when other benefits are available to an applicant, but the applicant will be liable to FEMA for any duplicative amounts that it receives or has available to it from other sources, and must repay FEMA for such amounts.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Duplication of programs.</E> FEMA will not provide assistance under this part for activities for which another Federal agency has more specific or primary authority to provide assistance for the same purpose. FEMA may disallow or recoup amounts that fall within another Federal agency's authority. FEMA may provide assistance under this part, but the applicant must agree to seek assistance from the appropriate Federal agency and to repay FEMA for amounts that are within another Agency's authority.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Negligence.</E> FEMA will provide no assistance to an applicant for costs attributable to applicant's own negligence. If the applicant suspects negligence by a third party for causing a condition for which FEMA made assistance available under this Part, the applicant is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the negligence of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits <PRTPAGE P="313"/>available to the recipient or subrecipient, and will treat them consistent with (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Intentional acts.</E> Any person who intentionally causes a condition for which assistance is provided under this part shall be liable to the United States to the extent that FEMA incurs costs attributable to the intentional act or omission that caused the condition. FEMA may provide assistance under this part, but it will be conditioned on an agreement by the applicant to cooperate with FEMA in efforts to recover the cost of the assistance from the liable party. A person shall not be liable under this section as a result of actions the person takes or omits in the course of rendering care or assistance in response to the fire.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preliminary damage assessment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The preliminary damage assessment (PDA) process is a mechanism used to determine the impact and magnitude of damage and the resulting unmet needs of individuals, businesses, the public sector, and the community as a whole. Information collected is used by the State as a basis for the Governor's request, and by FEMA to document the recommendation made to the President in response to the Governor's request. It is in the best interest of all parties to combine State and Federal personnel resources by performing a joint PDA prior to the initiation of a Governor's request, as follows.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preassessment by the State.</E> When an incident occurs, or is imminent, which the State official responsible for disaster operations determines may be beyond the State and local government capabilities to respond, the State will request the Regional Administrator to perform a joint FEMA-State preliminary damage assessment. It is not anticipated that all occurrences will result in the requirement for assistance; therefore, the State will be expected to verify their initial information, in some manner, before requesting this support.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Damage assessment teams.</E> Damage assessment teams will be composed of at least one representative of the Federal Government and one representative of the State. A local government representative, familiar with the extent and location of damage in his/her community, should also be included, if possible. Other State and Federal agencies, and voluntary relief organizations may also be asked to participate, as needed. It is the State's responsibility to coordinate State and local participation in the PDA and to ensure that <PRTPAGE P="323"/>the participants receive timely notification concerning the schedule. A FEMA official will brief team members on damage criteria, the kind of information to be collected for the particular incident, and reporting requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of findings.</E> At the close of the PDA, FEMA will consult with State officials to discuss findings and reconcile any differences.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The requirement for a joint PDA may be waived for those incidents of unusual severity and magnitude that do not require field damage assessments to determine the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Act, or in such other instances determined by the Regional Administrator upon consultation with the State. It may be necessary, however, to conduct an assessment to determine unmet needs for managerial response purposes.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 206.34</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Request for utilization of Department of Defense (DOD) resources.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> During the immediate aftermath of an incident which may ultimately qualify for a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency, when threats to life and property are present which cannot be effectively dealt with by the State or local governments, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may direct DOD to utilize DOD personnel and equipment for removal of debris and wreckage and temporary restoration of essential public facilities and services.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request process.</E> The Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request such DOD assistance. The Governor should submit the request to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 48 hours of the occurrence of the incident. Requests made after that time may still be considered if information is submitted indicating why the request for assistance could not be made during the initial 48 hours. The request shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) Information describing the types and amount of DOD emergency assistance being requested;</P>
              <P>(2) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;</P>
              <P>(3) A finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary for the preservation of life and property;</P>
              <P>(4) A certification by the Governor that the State and local government will reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal share of the cost of such work; and</P>
              <P>(5) An agreement:</P>
              <P>(i) To provide all lands, easements and rights-of-way necessary to accomplish the approved work without cost to the United States;</P>
              <P>(ii) To hold and save the United States free from damages due to the requested work, and to indemnify the Federal government against any claims arising from such work; and</P>
              <P>(iii) To assist DOD in all support and local jurisdictional matters.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Processing the request.</E> Upon receipt of the request, the Regional Administrator shall gather adequate information to support a recommendation and forward it to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. If the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that such work is essential to save lives and protect property, he/she will issue a mission assignment to DOD authorizing direct Federal assistance to the extent deemed appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Implementation of assistance.</E> The performance of emergency work may not exceed a period of 10 days from the date of the mission assignment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Limits.</E> Generally, no work shall be approved under this section which falls within the statutory authority of DOD or another Federal agency. However, where there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, not addressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under this section of the Stafford Act, the involvement of other Federal agencies would not preclude the <PRTPAGE P="324"/>authorization of DOD assistance by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Federal share.</E> The Federal share of assistance under this section shall be not less than 75 percent of the cost of eligible work.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Project management.</E> DOD shall ensure that the work is completed in accordance with the approved scope of work, costs, and time limitations in the mission assignment. DOD shall also keep the Regional Administrator and the State advised of work progress and other project developments. It is the responsibility of DOD to ensure compliance with applicable Federal, State and local legal requirements. A final report will be submitted to the Regional Administrator upon termination of all direct Federal assistance work. Final reports shall be signed by a representative of DOD and the State. Once the final eligible cost is determined, DOD will request reimbursement from FEMA and FEMA will submit a bill to the State for the non-Federal share of the mission assignment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reimbursement of DOD.</E> Reimbursement will be made in accordance with § 206.8 of these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for emergency declarations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When an incident occurs or threatens to occur in a State, which would not qualify under the definition of a major disaster, the Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request that the President declare an emergency. The Governor should submit the request to the President through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 5 days after the need for assistance under title V becomes apparent, but no longer than 30 days after the occurrence of the incident, in order to be considered. The period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate provided that a written request for such extension is made by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during the 30-day period immediately following the incident. The extension request must stipulate the reason for the delay.</P>
              <P>(b) The basis for the Governor's request must be the finding that the situation:</P>
              <P>(1) Is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capability of the State and the affected local government(s); and</P>
              <P>(2) Requires supplementary Federal emergency assistance to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;</P>
              <P>(2) Information describing the State and local efforts and resources which have been or will be used to alleviate the emergency;</P>
              <P>(3) Information describing other Federal agency efforts and resources which have been or will be used in responding to this incident; and</P>
              <P>(4) Identification of the type and extent of additional Federal aid required.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Modified declaration for Federal emergencies.</E> The requirement for a Governor's request under paragraph (a) of this section can be waived when an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility rests in the Federal government because the emergency involves a subject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the Federal government exercises exclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority. Any party may bring the existence of such a situation to the attention of the FEMA Regional Administrator. Any recommendation for a Presidential declaration of emergency in the absence of a Governor's request must be initiated by the Regional Administrator or transmitted through the Regional Administrator by another Federal agency. In determining that such an emergency exists, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or Regional Administrator shall consult the Governor of the affected State, if practicable.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other authorities.</E> It is not intended for an emergency declaration to <PRTPAGE P="325"/>preempt other Federal agency authorities and/or established plans and response mechanisms in place prior to the enactment of the Stafford Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for major disaster declarations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When a catastrophe occurs in a State, the Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request a major disaster declaration. The Governor should submit the request to the President through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 30 days of the occurrence of the incident in order to be considered. The 30-day period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, provided that a written request for an extension is submitted by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during this 30-day period. The extension request will stipulate reasons for the delay.</P>
              <P>(b) The basis for the request shall be a finding that:</P>
              <P>(1) The situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments; and</P>
              <P>(2) Federal assistance under the Act is necessary to supplement the efforts and available resources of the State, local governments, disaster relief organizations, and compensation by insurance for disaster-related losses.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;</P>
              <P>(2) An estimate of the amount and severity of damages and losses stating the impact of the disaster on the public and private sector;</P>
              <P>(3) Information describing the nature and amount of State and local resources which have been or will be committed to alleviate the results of the disaster;</P>
              <P>(4) Preliminary estimates of the types and amount of supplementary Federal disaster assistance needed under the Stafford Act; and</P>
              <P>(5) Certification by the Governor that State and local government obligations and expenditures for the current disaster will comply with all applicable cost sharing requirements of the Stafford Act.</P>
              <P>(d) For those catastrophes of unusual severity and magnitude when field damage assessments are not necessary to determine the requirement for supplemental Federal assistance, the Governor or Acting Governor may send an abbreviated written request through the Regional Administrator for a declaration of a major disaster. This may be transmitted in the most expeditious manner available. In the event the FEMA Regional Office is severely impacted by the catastrophe, the request may be addressed to the Administrator of FEMA. The request must indicate a finding in accordance with § 206.36(b), and must include as a minimum the information requested by § 206.36 (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(5). Upon receipt of the request, FEMA shall expedite the processing of reports and recommendations to the President. Notification to the Governor of the Presidential declaration shall be in accordance with 44 CFR 206.39. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorateshall assure that documentation of the declaration is later assembled to comply fully with these regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgment.</E> The Regional Administrator shall provide written acknowledgment of the Governor's request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Regional summary.</E> Based on information obtained by FEMA/State preliminary damage assessments of the affected area(s) and consultations with appropriate State and Federal officials and other interested parties, the Regional Administrator shall promptly prepare a summary of the PDA findings. The data will be analyzed and submitted with a recommendation to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Regional Analysis shall include a discussion of State and local resources and capabilities, and other assistance <PRTPAGE P="326"/>available to meet the major disaster or emergency-related needs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">FEMA recommendation.</E> Based on all available information, the Administrator shall formulate a recommendation which shall be forwarded to the President with the Governor's request.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Major disaster recommendation.</E> The recommendation will be based on a finding that the situation is or is not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the State and its local governments. It will also contain a determination of whether or not supplemental Federal assistance under the Stafford Act is necessary and appropriate. In developing a recommendation, FEMA will consider such factors as the amount and type of damages; the impact of damages on affected individuals, the State, and local governments; the available resources of the State and local governments, and other disaster relief organizations; the extent and type of insurance in effect to cover losses; assistance available from other Federal programs and other sources; imminent threats to public health and safety; recent disaster history in the State; hazard mitigation measures taken by the State or local governments, especially implementation of measures required as a result of previous major disaster declarations; and other factors pertinent to a given incident.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Emergency recommendation.</E> The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate whether or not Federal emergency assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act is necessary to supplement State and local efforts to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe. Only after it has been determined that all other resources and authorities available to meet the crisis are inadequate, and that assistance provided in section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate, will FEMA recommend an emergency declaration to the President.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Modified Federal emergency recommendation.</E> The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate that an emergency does or does not exist for which assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate. An emergency declaration will not be recommended in situations where the authority to respond or coordinate is within the jurisdiction of one or more Federal agencies without a Presidential declaration. However, where there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, not addressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under the Stafford Act, the involvement of other Federal agencies would not preclude a declaration of an emergency under the Act.</P>

The initial designations will <PRTPAGE P="327"/>usually be announced in the declaration. Determinations by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate of the types and extent of FEMA disaster assistance to be provided are based upon findings whether the damage involved and its effects are of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the response capabilities of the State, the affected local governments, and other potential recipients of supplementary Federal assistance. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may authorize all, or only particular types of, supplementary Federal assistance requested by the Governor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Areas eligible to receive assistance.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate also has been delegated authority to designate the affected areas eligible for supplementary Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. These designations shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> An affected area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate includes all local government jurisdictions within its boundaries. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may, based upon damage assessments in any given area, designate all or only some of the areas requested by the Governor for supplementary Federal assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for additional designations after a declaration.</E> After a declaration by the President, the Governor, or the GAR, may request that additional areas or types of supplementary Federal assistance be authorized by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. Such requests shall be accompanied by appropriate verified assessments and commitments by State and local governments to demonstrate that the requested designations are justified and that the unmet needs are beyond State and local capabilities without supplementary Federal assistance. Additional assistance or areas added to the declaration will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time limits to request.</E> In order to be considered, all supplemental requests under paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within 30 days from the termination date of the incident, or 30 days after the declaration, whichever is later. The 30-day period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate provided that a written request is made by the appropriate State official during this 30-day period. The request must include justification of the State's inability to meet the deadline.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Upon the declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, the Governor, acting for the State, and the FEMA Regional Administrator or his/her designee, acting for the Federal Government, shall execute a FEMA-State Agreement. The FEMA-State Agreement states the understandings, commitments, and conditions for assistance under which FEMA disaster assistance shall be provided. This Agreement imposes binding obligations on FEMA, States, their local governments, and private nonprofit organizations within the States in the form of conditions for assistance which are legally enforceable. No FEMA funding will be authorized or provided to any grantees or other recipients, nor will direct Federal assistance be authorized by mission assignment, until such time as this Agreement for the Presidential declaration has been signed, except where it is deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to begin the process of providing essential emergency services or housing assistance under the Individuals and Households Program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> This Agreement describes the incident and the incident period for which assistance will be made available, the type and extent of the Federal assistance to be made available, and contains the commitment of the State and local government(s) with respect to the amount of funds to be expended in alleviating damage and suffering caused by the major disaster or emergency. The Agreement also contains such other terms and conditions consistent with the declaration and the provisions of applicable laws, Executive Order and regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Provisions for modification.</E> In the event that the conditions stipulated in the original Agreement are changed or modified, such changes will be reflected in properly executed amendments to the Agreement, which may be signed by the GAR and the Regional Administrator or his/her designee for the specified major disaster or emergency. Amendments most often occur <PRTPAGE P="329"/>to close or amend the incident period, to add forms of assistance not originally authorized, or to designate additional areas eligible for assistance.</P>
              <P>(d) In a modified declaration for a Federal emergency, a FEMA-State Agreement may or may not be required based on the type of assistance being provided.</P>

              <P>(3) The State and the other eligible disaster applicants are not delinquent in payment of any debts to FEMA incurred as a result of Presidentially declared major disasters or emergencies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repayment of loans.</E> Any loan made to a State under paragraph (a) of this section must be repaid to the United States. The Governor must include a repayment schedule as part of the request for advance.</P>
              <P>(1) The State shall repay the loan (the principal disbursed plus interest) in accordance with the repayment schedule approved by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate together with the Chief Financial Officer.</P>

              <P>(a) We pay seventy-five percent (75%) of the eligible cost of permanent restorative work under section 406 of the Stafford Act and for emergency work under section 403 and section 407 of the Stafford Act, unless the Federal share is increased under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) We recommend an increase in the Federal cost share from seventy-five percent (75%) to not more than ninety percent (90%) of the eligible cost of permanent work under section 406 and of emergency work under section 403 and section 407 whenever a disaster is so extraordinary that actual Federal obligations under the Stafford Act, excluding FEMA administrative cost, meet or exceed a qualifying threshold of:</P>
              <P>(1) Beginning in 1999 and effective for disasters declared on or after May 21, 1999, $75 per capita of State population;</P>

              <P>(c) When we determine whether to recommend a cost-share adjustment we consider the impact of major disaster declarations in the State during the preceding twelve-month period.</P>
              <P>(d) If warranted by the needs of the disaster, we recommend up to one hundred percent (100%) Federal funding for emergency work under section 403 and section 407, including direct Federal assistance, for a limited period in the initial days of the disaster irrespective of the per capita impact.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 206.48</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Factors considered when evaluating a Governor's request for a major disaster declaration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When we review a Governor's request for major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, these are the primary factors in making a recommendation to the President whether assistance is warranted. We consider other relevant information as well.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Public Assistance Program.</E> We evaluate the following factors to evaluate the need for assistance under the Public Assistance Program.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Estimated cost of the assistance.</E> We evaluate the estimated cost of Federal and nonfederal public assistance against the statewide population to give some measure of the per capita impact within the State. We use a figure of $1 per capita as an indicator that the disaster is of such size that it might warrant Federal assistance, and adjust this figure annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. We are establishing a minimum threshold of $1 million in public assistance damages per disaster in the belief that we can reasonably expect even the lowest population States to cover this level of public assistance damage.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Localized impacts.</E> We evaluate the impact of the disaster at the county and local government level, as well as impacts at the American Indian and <PRTPAGE P="331"/>Alaskan Native Tribal Government levels, because at times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant Federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met. This is particularly true where critical facilities are involved or where localized per capita impacts might be extremely high. For example, we have at times seen localized damages in the tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita though the statewide per capita impact was low.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Insurance coverage in force.</E> We consider the amount of insurance coverage that is in force or should have been in force as required by law and regulation at the time of the disaster, and reduce the amount of anticipated assistance by that amount.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Hazard mitigation.</E> To recognize and encourage mitigation, we consider the extent to which State and local government measures contributed to the reduction of disaster damages for the disaster under consideration. For example, if a State can demonstrate in its disaster request that a Statewide building code or other mitigation measures are likely to have reduced the damages from a particular disaster, we consider that in the evaluation of the request. This could be especially significant in those disasters where, because of mitigation, the estimated public assistance damages fell below the per capita indicator.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Recent multiple disasters.</E> We look at the disaster history within the last twelve-month period to evaluate better the overall impact on the State or locality. We consider declarations under the Stafford Act as well as declarations by the Governor and the extent to which the State has spent its own funds.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Programs of other Federal assistance.</E> We also consider programs of other Federal agencies because at times their programs of assistance might more appropriately meet the needs created by the disaster.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors for the Individual Assistance Program.</E> The following factors are used to evaluate the need for supplemental Federal assistance to individuals under the Stafford Act, as Federal assistance may not supplant the combined capabilities of a State, Tribal, or local government. Federal Individual Assistance, if authorized, is intended to assist eligible individuals and families when State, Tribal, and local government resources and assistance programs are overwhelmed. State fiscal capacity (44 CFR 206.48(b)(1)(i)) and uninsured home and personal property losses (44 CFR 206.48(b)(2)) are the principal factors that FEMA will consider when evaluating the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Individuals and Households Program but FEMA will always consider all relevant information submitted as part of a declaration request. If the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Individuals and Households Program is not clear from the evaluation of the principal factors, FEMA will turn to the other factors to determine the level of need.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">State fiscal capacity and resource availability.</E> FEMA will evaluate the availability of State resources, and where appropriate, any extraordinary circumstances that contributed to the absence of sufficient resources.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fiscal capacity (principal factor for individuals and households program).</E> Fiscal capacity is a State's potential ability to raise revenue from its own sources to respond to and recover from a disaster. The following data points are indicators of fiscal capacity.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Total taxable resources (TTR) of the State.</E> TTR is the U.S. Department of Treasury's annual estimate of the relative fiscal capacity of a State. A low TTR may indicate a greater need for supplemental Federal assistance than a high TTR.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Gross domestic product (GDP) by State.</E> GDP by State is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDP by State may be used as an alternative or supplemental evaluation method to TTR.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Per capita personal income by local area.</E> Per capita personal income by local area is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. A low per capita personal income by local area may indicate a greater need for supplemental Federal assistance than a high per capita personal income by local area.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Other factors.</E> Other limits on a State's treasury or ability to collect funds may be considered.<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Resource availability.</E> Federal disaster assistance under the Stafford Act is intended to be supplemental in nature, and is not a replacement for State emergency relief programs, services, and funds. FEMA evaluates the availability of resources from State, Tribal, and local governments as well as non-governmental organizations and the private sector.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">State, tribal, and local government; non-governmental organizations (NGO); and Private Sector Activity.</E> State, Tribal, and local government, Non-Governmental Organizations, and private sector resources may offset the need for or reveal an increased need for supplemental Federal assistance. The State may provide information regarding the resources that have been and will be committed to meet the needs of disaster survivors such as housing programs, resources provided through financial and in-kind donations, and the availability of affordable (as determined by the U.S. Department of Urban and Housing Development's fair market rent standards) rental housing within a reasonable commuting distance of the impacted area.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Cumulative effect of recent disasters.</E> The cumulative effect of recent disasters may affect the availability of State, Tribal, local government, NGO, and private sector disaster recovery resources. The State should provide information regarding the disaster history within the last 24-month period, particularly those occurring within the current fiscal cycle, including both Presidential (public and individual assistance) and gubernatorial disaster declarations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Uninsured home and personal property losses (principal factor for individuals and households program).</E> Uninsured home and personal property losses may suggest a need for supplemental Federal assistance. The State may provide the following preliminary damage assessment data:</P>
              <P>(i) The cause of damage.</P>
              <P>(ii) The jurisdictions impacted and concentration of damage.</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of homes impacted and degree of damage.</P>
              <P>(iv) The estimated cost of assistance.</P>
              <P>(v) The homeownership rate of impacted homes.</P>
              <P>(vi) The percentage of affected households with sufficient insurance coverage appropriate to the peril.</P>
              <P>(vii) Other relevant preliminary damage assessment data.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Disaster impacted population profile.</E> The demographics of a disaster impacted population may identify additional needs that require a more robust community response and delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. FEMA will consider demographics of the impacted communities for the following data points as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau or other Federal agencies:</P>
              <P>(i) The percentage of the population for whom poverty status is determined.</P>
              <P>(ii) The percentage of the population already receiving government assistance such as Supplemental Security Income and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.</P>
              <P>(iii) The pre-disaster unemployment rate.</P>
              <P>(iv) The percentage of the population that is 65 years old and older.</P>
              <P>(v) The percentage of the population 18 years old and younger.</P>
              <P>(vi) The percentage of the population with a disability.</P>
              <P>(vii) The percentage of the population who speak a language other than English and speak English less than “very well.”</P>
              <P>(viii) Any unique considerations regarding American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribal populations raised in the State's request for a major disaster declaration that may not be reflected in the data points referenced in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Impact to community infrastructure.</E> The following impacts to a community's infrastructure may adversely affect a population's ability to safely and securely reside within the community.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Life saving and life sustaining services.</E> The effects of a disaster may cause disruptions to or increase the demand for life-saving and life-sustaining services, necessitate a more robust response, and may delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. The State may provide information regarding the impact on life saving and life sustaining services for a period of <PRTPAGE P="333"/>greater than 72 hours. Such services include but are not limited to police, fire/EMS, hospital/medical, sewage, and water treatment services.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Essential community services.</E> The effects of a disaster may cause disruptions to or increase the demand for essential community services and delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. The State may provide information regarding the impact on essential community services for a period greater than 72 hours. Such services include but are not limited to schools, social services programs and providers, child care, and eldercare.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Transportation infrastructure and utilities.</E> Transportation infrastructure or utility disruptions may render housing uninhabitable or inaccessible. Such conditions may also affect the delivery of life sustaining commodities, provision of emergency services, ability to shelter in place, and efforts to rebuild. The State may provide information regarding the impact on transportation infrastructure and utilities for a period of greater than 72 hours.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Casualties.</E> The number of individuals who are missing, injured, or deceased due to a disaster may indicate a heightened need for supplemental Federal disaster assistance. The State may report the number of missing, injured, or deceased individuals.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Disaster related unemployment.</E> The number of disaster survivors who lost work or became unemployed due to a disaster and who do not qualify for standard unemployment insurance may indicate a heightened need for supplemental Federal assistance. This usually includes the self-employed, service industry workers, and seasonal workers such as those employed in tourism, fishing, or agriculture industries. The State may provide an estimate of the number of disaster survivors impacted under this paragraph as well as information regarding major employers affected.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Temporary housing assistance for emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section prescribes the policy to be followed by the Federal Government or any other organization when implementing section 408 of the Stafford Act for Presidentially-<PRTPAGE P="335"/>declared emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002 (Note that the reference to section 408 of the Stafford Act refers to prior legislation amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act 2000).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Program intent.</E> Assistance under this program is made available to applicants who require temporary housing as a result of a major disaster or emergency that is declared by the President. Eligibility for assistance is based on need created by disaster-related unlivability of a primary residence or other disaster-related displacement, combined with a lack of adequate insurance coverage. Eligible applicants may be paid for authorized accommodations and/or repairs. In the interest of assisting the greatest number of people in the shortest possible time, applicants who are able to do so will be encouraged to make their own arrangements for temporary housing. Although numerous instances of minor damage may cause some inconvenience to the applicant, the determining eligibility factor must be the livability of the primary residence. FEMA has also determined that it is reasonable to expect applicants or their landlords to make some repairs of a minor nature. Temporary housing will normally consist of a check to cover housing-related costs wherever possible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Adequate alternate housing</E> means housing that:</P>
              <P>(i) Accommodates the needs of the occupants.</P>
              <P>(ii) Is within reasonable commuting distance of work, school, or agricultural activities which provide over 25% of the household income.</P>
              <P>(iii) Is within the financial ability of the occupant in the realization of a permanent housing plan.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective date of assistance</E> means the date the eligible applicant received temporary housing assistance but, where applicable, only after appropriate insurance benefits are exhausted.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Essential living area</E> means that area of the residence essential to normal living, i.e., kitchen, one bathroom, dining area, living room, entrances and exits, and essential sleeping areas. It does not include family rooms, guest rooms, garages, or other nonessential areas, unless hazards exist in these areas which impact the safety of the essential living area.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Fair market rent</E> means a reasonable amount to pay in the local area for the size and type of accommodations which meets the applicant's needs.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Financial ability</E> is the determination of the occupant's ability to pay housing costs. The determination is based upon the amount paid for housing before the disaster, provided the household income has not changed subsequent to or as a result of the disaster or 25 percent of gross post disaster income if the household income changed as a result of the disaster. When computing financial ability, extreme or unusual financial circumstances may be considered by the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Household</E> means all residents of the predisaster residence who request temporary housing assistance, plus any additions during the temporary housing period, such as infants, spouses, or part-time residents who were not present at the time of the disaster but who are expected to return during the temporary housing period.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Housing costs</E> means shelter rent and mortgage payments including principal, interest, real estate taxes, real property insurance, and utility costs, where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Occupant</E> means an eligible applicant residing in temporary housing provided under this section.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Owner-occupied</E> means that the residence is occupied by: the legal owner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence and pays no rent but is responsible for the payment of taxes, or maintenance of the residence; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights with formal title vested in another.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Primary residence</E> means the dwelling where the applicant normally lives during the major portion of the calendar year, a dwelling which is required because of proximity to employment, or to agricultural activities as referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Duplication of benefits</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requirement to avoid duplication.</E> Temporary <PRTPAGE P="336"/>housing assistance shall not be provided to an applicant if such assistance has been provided by any other source. If any State or local government or voluntary agency has provided temporary housing, the assistance under this section begins at the expiration of such assistance, and may continue for a period not to exceed l8 months from the date of declaration, provided the criteria for continued assistance in paragraph (k)(3) of this section are met. If it is determined that temporary housing assistance will be provided under this section, notification shall be given those agencies which have the potential for duplicating such assistance. In the instance of insured applicants, temporary housing assistance shall be provided only when:</P>
              <P>(i) Payment of the applicable benefits has been significantly delayed;</P>
              <P>(ii) Applicable benefits have been exhausted;</P>
              <P>(iii) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the temporary housing need; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Housing is not available on the private market.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Recovery of funds.</E> Prior to provision of assistance, the applicant must agree to repay to FEMA from insurance proceeds or recoveries from any other source an amount equivalent to the value of the temporary housing assistance provided. In no event shall the amount repaid to FEMA exceed the amount recovered by the applicant. All claims shall be collected in accordance with agency procedures for debt collection.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applications</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application period.</E> The standard FEMA application period is the 60 days following the date the President declares an incident a major disaster or an emergency. The Regional Administrator may, however, extend the application period, when we anticipate that we need more time to collect applications from the affected population or to establish the same application deadline for contiguous Counties or States. After the application period has ended, FEMA will accept and process applications for an additional 60 days only from persons who can provide an acceptable explanation (and documentation to substantiate their explanation) for why they were not able to contact FEMA before the application period ended.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Household composition.</E> Members of a household shall be included on a single application and be provided one temporary housing residence unless it is determined by the Regional Administrator that the size of the household requires that more than one residence be provided.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">General eligibility guidelines.</E> Temporary housing assistance may be made available to those applicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency declared by the President, are qualified for such assistance.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Conditions of eligibility.</E> Temporary housing assistance may be provided only when <E T="03">both</E> of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant's primary residence has been made unlivable or the applicant has been displaced as the result of a major disaster or emergency because:</P>
              <P>(A) The residence has been destroyed, essential utility service has been interrupted, or the essential living area has been damaged as a result of the disaster to such an extent as to constitute a serious health or safety hazard which did not exist prior to the disaster. The Regional Administrator shall prepare additional guidelines when necessary to respond to a particular disaster;</P>
              <P>(B) The residence has been made inaccessible as a result of the incident to the extent that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to gain entry due to the disruption or destruction of transportation routes, other impediments to access, or restrictions placed on movement by a responsible official due to continued health and safety problems;</P>
              <P>(C) The owner of the applicant's residence requires the residence to meet their personal needs because the owner's predisaster residence was made unlivable as a result of the disaster;</P>
              <P>(D) Financial hardship resulting from the disaster has led to eviction or dispossession; or</P>

              <P>(E) Other circumstances resulting from the disaster, as determined by the Regional Administrator, prevent the applicant from occupying their predisaster primary residence.<PRTPAGE P="337"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Insured applicants have made every reasonable effort to secure insurance benefits, and the insured has agreed to repay FEMA from whatever insurance proceeds are later received, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Conditions of ineligibility.</E> Except as provided for in section 408(b), Temporary Housing Assistance shall not be provided:</P>
              <P>(i) To an applicant who is displaced from other than their primary residence; or</P>
              <P>(ii) When the residence in question is livable, i.e., only minor damage exists and it can reasonably be expected to be repaired by the applicant/owner or the landlord; or</P>
              <P>(iii) When the applicant owns a secondary or vacation residence, or unoccupied rental property which meets their temporary housing needs; or</P>
              <P>(iv) To an applicant who has adequate rent-free housing accommodations; or</P>
              <P>(v) To an applicant who has adequate insurance coverage and there is no indication that benefits will be delayed; or</P>
              <P>(vi) When a late application is not approved for processing by the Regional Administrator; or</P>
              <P>(vii) To an applicant who evacuated the residence in response to official warnings solely as a precautionary measure, and who is able to return to the residence immediately after the incident (i.e., the applicant is not otherwise eligible for temporary housing assistance).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Forms of Temporary Housing Assistance.</E> All proceeds received or receivable by the applicant under § 206.101 shall be exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release, or waiver. No rights under this provision are assignable or transferable.</P>
              <P>(1) Temporary Housing Assistance is normally provided in the form of a check to cover the cost of rent or essential home repairs. The exceptions to this are when existing rental resources are not available and repairs to the home will not make it livable in a reasonable period of time, or when the eligible applicant is unable to physically leave the home due to the need to tend crops or livestock.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Government-owned, private, and commercial properties.</E> When an eligible applicant is unable to obtain an available temporary housing unit, FEMA may enter into a leasing agreement for the eligible applicant. Rent payments shall be in accordance with the fair market rent (FMR) rates established for each operation for the type and size residence.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Transient accommodations.</E> Immediately following a Presidentially declared major disaster or emergency, disaster victims are expected to stay with family or friends without FEMA assistance, or to make use of mass shelters to the fullest extent possible for short-term housing. Transient accommodations may be provided when individual circumstances warrant such assistance for only a short period of time or pending provision of other temporary housing resources. Transient accommodations may be provided for up to 30 days unless this period is extended by the Regional Administrator. Authorized expenditures for transient accommodations shall be restricted to the rental cost including utilities except for those which are separately metered. Payment for food, telephone, or other similar services is not authorized under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units. Government-owned or privately owned mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units may be placed on commercial, private, or group sites. The placement must comply with applicable State and local codes and ordinances as well as FEMA'S regulations at 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and the regulations at 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations.</P>

              <P>(i) A commercial site is a site customarily leased for a fee because it is fully equipped to accommodate a housing unit. In accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B), the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has determined that leasing commercial sites at Federal expense is in the public interest. When the Regional Administrator determines that <PRTPAGE P="338"/>upgrading of commercial sites or installation of utilities on such sites will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources, they may authorize such action at Federal expense.</P>
              <P>(ii) A private site is a site provided or obtained by the applicant at no cost to the Federal Government. Also in accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B), the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has determined that the cost of installation or repairs of essential utilities on private sites is authorized at Federal expense when such actions will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources.</P>
              <P>(iii) A group site is a site which accommodates two or more units. In accordance with section 408(a)(2)(A), locations for group sites shall be provided by State or local government complete with utilities. However, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may authorize development of group sites, including installation of essential utilities, by the Federal Government, based on a recommendation from the Regional Administrator; provided, however, that the Federal expense is limited to 75 percent of the cost of construction and development (including installation of utilities). In accordance with section 408(a)(4) of the Stafford Act, the State or local government shall pay any cost which is not paid for from the Federal share, including long-term site maintenance such as snow removal, street repairs and other services of a governmental nature.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Temporary mortgage and rental payments.</E> Assistance in the form of mortgage or rental payments may be paid to or be provided on behalf of eligible applicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency, have received written notice of dispossession or eviction from their primary residence by foreclosure of any mortgage or lien, cancellation of any contract of sale, or termination of any lease entered into prior to the disaster. Written notice, for the purpose of this paragraph, means a communication in writing by a landlord, mortgage holder, or other party authorized under State law to file such notice. The purpose of such notice is to notify a person of impending termination of a lease, foreclosure of a mortgage or lien, or cancellation of any contract of sale, which would result in the person's dispossession or eviction. Applications for this type of assistance may be filed for up to 6 months following the date of declaration. This assistance may be provided for a period not to exceed 18 months or for the duration of the period of financial hardship, as determined by the Regional Administrator, whichever is less. The location of the residence of an applicant for assistance under this section shall not be a consideration of eligibility.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Home repairs.</E> Repairs may be authorized to quickly repair or restore to a livable condition that portion of or areas affecting the essential living area of, or private access to, an owner-occupied primary residence which was damaged as a result of the disaster. Installation of utilities or conveniences not available in the residence prior to the disaster shall not be provided. However, repairs which are authorized shall conform to applicable local and/or State building codes; upgrading of existing damaged utilities may be authorized when required by these codes.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Options for repairs.</E> Eligible applicants approved for repairs may be assisted through one or a combination of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Cash payment.</E> Payment shall be limited to the reasonable costs for the repairs and replacements in the locality, as determined by the Regional Administrator. This will be the method normally used, unless unusual circumstances warrant the methods listed under paragraph (g)(4), (i) (B) or (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) Provision of materials and replacement items.</P>
              <P>(C) Government awarded repair contracts when authorized by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Feasibility.</E> Repairs may be provided to those eligible applicants:</P>
              <P>(A) Who are owner-occupants of the residence to be made livable;</P>

              <P>(B) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential living <PRTPAGE P="339"/>area within 30 days following the feasibility determination. The Regional Administrator may extend this period for extenuating circumstances by determining that this type of assistance is still more cost effective, timely and otherwise suitable than other forms for temporary housing; and</P>
              <P>(C) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential living area, the cost of which do not exceed the dollar limitations established by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Regional Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive the dollar limitations when repairs are more cost effective and appropriate than other forms of housing assistance or when extenuating circumstances warrant.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Scope of work.</E> The type of repair or replacement authorized may vary depending upon the nature of the disaster. Items will be repaired where feasible or replaced only when necessary to insure the safety or health of the occupant. Replacement items shall be of average quality, size, and capacity taking into consideration the needs of the occupant. Repairs shall be disaster related and shall be limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) Repairs to the plumbing system, including repairs to or replacement of fixtures, providing service to the kitchen and one bathroom;</P>
              <P>(B) Repairs to the electrical system providing service to essential living areas, including repairs to or replacement of essential fixtures;</P>
              <P>(C) Repairs to the heating unit, including repairs to duct work, vents, and integral fuel and electrical systems. If repair or replacement through other forms of assistance cannot be accomplished before the start of the season requiring heat, home repairs may be authorized by the Regional Administrator when an inspection shows that the unit has been damaged beyond repair, or when the availability of necessary parts or components makes repair impossible;</P>
              <P>(D) Repairs to or replacement of essential components of the fuel system to provide for cooking;</P>
              <P>(E) Pumping and cleaning of the septic system, repairs to or replacement of the tank, drainfield, or repairs to sewer lines;</P>
              <P>(F) Flushing and/or purifying the water well, and repairs to or replacement of the pump, controls, tank, and pipes;</P>
              <P>(G) Repairs to or replacement of exterior doors, repair of windows and/or screens needed for health purposes;</P>
              <P>(H) Repairs to the roof, when the damages affect the essential living area;</P>
              <P>(I) Repairs to interior floors, when severe buckling or deterioration creates a serious safety hazard;</P>
              <P>(J) Blocking, leveling, and anchoring of a mobile home; and reconnecting and/or resetting mobile home sewer, water, electrical and fuel lines, and tanks;</P>
              <P>(K) Emergency repairs to private access routes, limited to those repairs that meet the minimum safety standards and using the most economical materials available. Such repairs are provided on a one-time basis when no alternative access facilities are immediately available and when the repairs are more cost effective, timely or otherwise suitable than other forms of temporary housing.</P>
              <P>(L) Repairs to the foundation piers, walls or footings when the damages affect the structural integrity of the essential living area;</P>
              <P>(M) Repairs to the stove and refrigerator, when feasible; and</P>
              <P>(N) Elimination of other health and safety hazards or performance of essential repairs which are authorized by the Regional Administrator as not available through emergency services provided by voluntary or community agencies, and cannot reasonably be expected to be completed on a timely basis by the occupant without FEMA assistance.</P>

              <P>(iv) Requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act. FEMA has determined that flood insurance purchase requirements need not be imposed as a condition of receiving assistance under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Repair recipients will normally receive assistance for further repairs from other programs which will impose the purchase and maintenance requirements. Home repairs may not be provided in Zones A or V of a sanctioned or suspended community except for items that are not covered by flood insurance.<PRTPAGE P="340"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Appropriate form of temporary housing.</E> The form of temporary housing provided should not exceed occupants' minimum requirements, taking into consideration items such as timely availability, cost effectiveness, permanent housing plans, special needs (handicaps, the location of crops and livestock, etc.) of the occupants, and the requirements of FEMA'S floodplain management regulations at 44 CFR part 9. An eligible applicant shall receive one form of temporary housing, except for transient accommodations or when provision of an additional form is in the best interest of the Government. An eligible applicant is expected to accept the first offer of temporary housing; unwarranted refusal shall result in forfeiture of temporary housing assistance. Existing rental resources and home repairs shall be utilized to the fullest extent practicable prior to provision of government-owned mobile homes.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Utility costs and security deposits.</E> All utility costs shall be the responsibility of the occupant except where utility services are not metered separately and are therefore a part of the rental charge. Utility use charges and deposits shall always be the occupants responsibility. When authorized by the Regional Administrator, the Federal Government may pay security deposits; however, the owner or occupant shall reimburse the full amount of the security deposit to the Federal Government before or at the time that the temporary housing assistance is terminated.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Furniture.</E> An allowance for essential furniture may be provided to occupants when such assistance is required to occupy the primary or temporary housing residence. However, loss of furniture does not in and of itself constitute eligibility for temporary housing assistance. Luxury items shall not be provided.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Duration of assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Commencement.</E> Temporary housing assistance may be provided as of the date of the incident of the major disaster or emergency as specified in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice and may continue for 18 months from the date of declaration. An effective date of assistance shall be established for each applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Continued assistance.</E> Predisaster renters normally shall be provided no more than 1 month of assistance unless the Regional Administrator determines that continued assistance is warranted in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section. All other occupants of temporary housing shall be certified eligible for continued assistance in increments not to exceed 3 months. Recertification of eligibility for continued assistance shall be in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section, taking into consideration the occupant's permanent housing plan. A realistic permanent housing plan shall be established for each occupant requesting additional assistance no later than at the time of the first recertification.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Criteria for continued assistance.</E> A temporary housing occupant shall make every effort to obtain and occupy permanent housing at the earliest possible time. A temporary housing occupant will be required to provide receipts documenting disaster related housing costs and shall be eligible for continued assistance when:</P>
              <P>(i) Adequate alternate housing is not available;</P>
              <P>(ii) The permanent housing plan has not been realized through no fault of the occupant; or</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of FEMA-owner leases, the occupant is in compliance with the terms of the lease/rental agreement.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Period of assistance.</E> Provided the occupant is eligible for continued assistance, assistance shall be provided for a period not to exceed 18 months from the declaration date.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> Occupants shall have the right to appeal a program determination in accordance with the following:</P>

              <P>(1) An applicant declared ineligible for temporary housing assistance, an applicant whose application has been cancelled for cause, an applicant whose application has been refused because of late filing, and an occupant who received a direct housing payment but is not eligible for continued assistance in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section, shall have the right to dispute such a determination within 60 calendar days following notification of <PRTPAGE P="341"/>such action. The Regional Administrator shall reconsider the original decision within 15 calendar days after its receipt. The appellant shall be given a written notice of the disposition of the dispute. The decision of the Regional Administrator is final.</P>
              <P>(2) An occupant who has been notified that his/her request to purchase a mobile home or manufactured housing unit or that a request for an adjustment to the sales price has been denied shall have the right to dispute such a determination within 60 business days after receipt of such notice. The Regional Administrator shall reconsider the original decision within 15 calendar days after receipt of the appeal. The appellant shall receive written notice of the disposition of the dispute. The decision of the Regional Administrator is final.</P>
              <P>(3) Termination of assistance provided through a FEMA lease agreement shall be initiated with a 15-day written notice after which the occupant shall be liable for such additional charges as are deemed appropriate by the Regional Administrator including, but not limited to, the fair market rental for the temporary housing residence.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Grounds for termination.</E> Temporary housing assistance may be terminated for reasons including, but not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Adequate alternate housing is available to the occupant(s);</P>
              <P>(B) The temporary housing assistance was obtained either through misrepresentation or fraud; or</P>
              <P>(C) Failure to comply with any term of the lease/rental agreement.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Termination procedures.</E> These procedures shall be utilized in all instances except when a State is administering the Temporary Housing Assistance program. States shall be subject to their own procedures provided they afford the occupant(s) with due process safeguards described in paragraph (m)(2)(v)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Notification to occupant.</E> Written notice shall be given by FEMA to the occupant(s) at least 15 days prior to the proposed termination of assistance. This notice shall specify: the reasons for termination of assistance/occupancy; the date of termination, which shall be not less than 15 days after receipt of the notice; the administrative procedure available to the occupant if they wish to dispute the action; and the occupant's liability after the termination date for additional charges.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Filing of appeal.</E> If the occupant desires to dispute the termination, upon receipt of the written notice specified in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, he/she shall present an appeal in writing to the appropriate office in person or by mail within 60 days from the date of the termination notice. The appeal must be signed by the occupant and state the reasons why the assistance or occupancy should not be terminated. If a hearing is desired, the appeal should so state.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Response to appeal.</E> If a hearing pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section has not been requested, the occupant has waived the right to a hearing. The appropriate program official shall deliver or mail a written response to the occupant within 5 business days after the receipt of the appeal.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Request for hearing.</E> If the occupant requests a hearing pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, FEMA shall schedule a hearing date within 10 business days from the receipt of the appeal, at a time and place reasonably convenient to the occupant, who shall be notified promptly thereof in writing. The notice of hearing shall specify the procedure governing the hearing.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Hearing</E>—(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Hearing officer.</E> The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer, who shall be designated by the Regional Administrator, and who shall not have been involved with the decision to terminate the occupant's temporary housing assistance, nor be a subordinate of any individual who was so involved.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Due process.</E> The occupant shall be afforded a fair hearing and provided the basic safeguards of due process, including cross-examination of the responsible official(s), access to the documents on which FEMA is relying, the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, and the right to a written decision.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If an occupant fails to appear at a hearing, the Hearing Officer may make a determination that the occupant has waived the right <PRTPAGE P="342"/>to a hearing, or may, for good cause shown, postpone the hearing for no more than 5 business days.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Proof.</E> At the hearing, the occupant must first attempt to establish that continued assistance is appropriate; thereafter, FEMA must sustain the burden of proof in justifying that termination of assistance is appropriate. The occupant shall have the right to present evidence and arguments in support of their complaint, to controvert evidence relied on by FEMA, and to cross examine all witnesses on whose testimony or information FEMA relies. The hearing shall be conducted by the Hearing Officer, and any evidence pertinent to the facts and issues raised may be received without regard to its admissibility under rules of evidence employed in formal judicial proceedings.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Decision.</E> The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be based solely upon applicable Federal and State law, and FEMA regulations and requirements promulgated thereunder. The Hearing Officer shall prepare a written decision setting forth a statement of findings and conclusions together with the reasons therefor, concerning all material issues raised by the complainant within 5 business days after the hearing. The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be binding on FEMA, which shall take all actions necessary to carry out the decision or refrain from any actions prohibited by the decision.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The decision shall include a notice to the occupant that he/she must vacate the premises within 3 days of receipt of the written notice or on the termination date stated in the original notice of termination, as required in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, whichever is later. If the occupant does not quit the premises, appropriate action shall be taken and, if suit is brought, the occupant may be required to pay court costs and attorney fees.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the occupant is required to give a specific number of days' notice which exceeds the number of days in the termination notice, the Regional Administrator may approve the payment of rent for this period of time if requested by the occupant.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Disposition of temporary housing units</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acquisition.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may purchase mobile homes or other manufactured housing units for those who require temporary housing. After such temporary housing is vacated, it shall be returned to one of the FEMA-operated Strategic Storage Centers for refurbishment and storage until needed in a subsequent major disaster or emergency. When returning the unit to a Strategic Storage Center is not feasible or cost effective, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may prescribe a different method of disposition in accordance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sales</E>—(i) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> When adequate alternate housing is not available, the Regional Administrator shall make available for sale directly to a temporary housing occupant(s) any mobile home or manufactured housing unit acquired by purchase, in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The unit is to be used as a primary residence;</P>
              <P>(B) The purchaser has a site that complies with local codes and ordinances as well as FEMA's floodplain management regulations at 44 CFR part 9 (in particular § 9.13(e)); and</P>
              <P>(C) The purchaser has sufficient funds to purchase and, if necessary, relocate the unit. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve the sale of a mobile home or manufactured housing unit to a temporary housing occupant when adequate alternate housing is available but only when such sales are clearly in the best interest of the Government.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sales price.</E> Units shall be sold at prices that are fair and equitable to the purchaser and to the Government, as determined by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The purchaser shall pay the total sales price at the time of sale.</P>
              <P>(iii) Adjustment to the sales price.</P>
              <P>(A) Adjustments to the sales price may be provided only when both of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) There is a need to purchase the unit for use as the purchaser's primary <PRTPAGE P="343"/>residence because other adequate alternate housing is unavailable. Adequate alternate housing must meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and may consist of:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Existing housing;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Additional resources such as disaster-damaged rental accommodations which can reasonably be expected to be repaired and become available in the near future;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) New housing construction or housing to be made available through Government subsidy which is included in the immediate recovery plans for the area; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Residences which can be repaired by the predisaster owner/occupant through funds available from insurance, other disaster assistance programs, or through their own resources.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In addition to his/her resources, the purchaser cannot obtain sufficient funds through insurance proceeds, disaster loans, grants, and commercial lending institutions to cover the sales price.</P>
              <P>(B) To determine the adjusted sales price, the current available financial resources of the purchaser shall be calculated. If the financial resources are equal to or greater than the basic sales price, then no adjustment shall be approved. If the purchaser's financial resources are less than the basic sales price, the sales price shall be adjusted to take into consideration the financial resources available but shall include some consideration. Deviations from this rule may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</P>
              <P>(C) The Regional Administrator must approve all adjustments to the sales price of a mobile home.</P>
              <P>(iv) Other conditions of sale.</P>
              <P>(A) A unit shall be sold “as is, where is” except for repairs necessary to protect health or safety, which are to be completed prior to sale. There shall be no implied warranties. In addition, the purchaser must be informed that he/she may have to bring the unit up to codes and standards which are applicable at the proposed site.</P>
              <P>(B) In accordance with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, as amended, the sale of a unit for the purpose of meeting the permanent housing need of an individual or family may not be approved where the unit would be placed in a designated special flood hazard area which has been identified by the Administrator for at least 1 year as floodprone unless the community in which the unit is to be located after the sale is, at the time of approval, participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. The purchaser must agree to buy and maintain an adequate flood insurance policy for as long as the unit is occupied by the purchaser. An adequate policy for purposes of this paragraph shall mean one which provides coverage for the basic sales price of the unit. The purchaser must provide proof of purchase of the initial flood insurance policy.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transfer.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may lend temporary housing units purchased under section 408(a) of the Act directly to States, other Governmental entities, or voluntary organizations. Such transfers may be made only in connection with a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency. Donations may be made only when it is in the best interest of the Government, such as when future re-use by the Federal Government would not be economically feasible. As a condition of such transfers, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall require that the recipient:</P>
              <P>(i) Utilize the units for the purpose of providing temporary housing for victims of major disasters or emergencies in accordance with the written agreement; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Comply with the current applicable FEMA policies and regulations, including this section; 44 CFR part 9 (especially §§ 9.13 and 9.14), Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands; 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may order returned any temporary housing unit made available under this section which is not used in accordance with the terms of transfer.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Reports.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, Regional Administrator, or <PRTPAGE P="344"/>Federal Coordinating Officer may require from field operations such reports, plans, and evaluations as they deem necessary to carry out their responsibilities under the Act and these regulations.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Federal responsibility.</E> The Federal financial and operational responsibility for the Temporary Housing Assistance program shall not exceed 18 months from the date of the declaration of the major disaster or emergency. This period may be extended in writing by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, based on a determination that an extension is necessary and in the public interest. The Regional Administrator may authorize continued use on a non-reimbursable basis of Government property, office space, and equipment by a State, other Government entity, or voluntary organization after the 18 month period.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Applicant notification</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> All applicants for temporary housing assistance will be notified regarding the type and amount of assistance for which they are qualified.

              <SUBJECT>Federal assistance to individuals and households.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section implements the policy and procedures set forth in section 408 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174, as amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This program provides financial assistance and, if necessary, direct assistance to eligible individuals and households who, as a direct result of a major disaster or emergency, have uninsured or under-insured, necessary expenses and serious needs and are unable to meet such expenses or needs through other means.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum amount of assistance.</E> No individual or household will receive financial assistance greater than $25,000 under this subpart with respect to a single major disaster or emergency. FEMA will adjust the $25,000 limit annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers that the Department of Labor publishes.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple types of assistance.</E> One or more types of housing assistance may be made available under this section to meet the needs of individuals and households in the particular disaster situation. FEMA shall determine the appropriate types of housing assistance to be provided under this section based on considerations of cost effectiveness, convenience to the individuals and households and the suitability and availability of the types of assistance. An applicant is expected to accept the first offer of housing assistance; unwarranted refusal of assistance may result in the forfeiture of future housing assistance. Temporary housing and repair assistance shall be utilized to the fullest extent practicable before other types of housing assistance.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Date of eligibility.</E> Eligibility for Federal assistance under this subpart will begin on the date of the incident that results in a presidential declaration that a major disaster or emergency exists, except that reasonable lodging expenses that are incurred in anticipation of and immediately preceding such event may be eligible for Federal assistance under this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Period of assistance.</E> FEMA may provide assistance under this subpart for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of declaration. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may extend this period if he/she determines that due to extraordinary circumstances an extension would be in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Assistance not counted as income.</E> Assistance under this subpart is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determination of eligibility for welfare, income assistance or income-tested benefit programs that the Federal Government funds.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exemption from garnishment.</E> All assistance provided under this subpart is exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release or waiver. Recipients of rights under this provision may not reassign or transfer the rights. These exemptions do not apply to FEMA recovering assistance fraudulently obtained or misapplied.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Duplication of benefits.</E> In accordance with the requirements of section 312 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155, FEMA will not provide assistance under this subpart when any other source has already provided such assistance or when such assistance is <PRTPAGE P="347"/>available from any other source. In the instance of insured applicants, we will provide assistance under this subpart only when:</P>
              <P>(1) Payment of the applicable benefits are significantly delayed;</P>
              <P>(2) Applicable benefits are exhausted;</P>
              <P>(3) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the housing or other needs; or</P>
              <P>(4) Housing is not available on the private market.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Cost sharing.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the Federal share of eligible costs paid under this subpart shall be 100 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) Federal and State cost shares for “Other Needs” assistance under subsections 408 (e) and (f) of the Stafford Act will be as follows;</P>
              <P>(i) The Federal share shall be 75 percent; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The non-federal share shall be paid from funds made available by the State. If the State does not provide the non-Federal share to FEMA before FEMA begins to provide assistance to individuals and households under subsection 408(e) of the Stafford Act, FEMA will still process applications. The State will then be obliged to reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal cost share of such assistance on a monthly basis. If the State does not provide such reimbursement on a monthly basis, then FEMA will issue a Bill for Collection to the State on a monthly basis for the duration of the program. FEMA will charge interest, penalties, and administrative fees on delinquent Bills for Collection in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act. Cost shared funds, interest, penalties and fees owed to FEMA through delinquent Bills for Collections may be offset from other FEMA disaster assistance programs (<E T="03">i.e.</E> Public Assistance) from which the State is receiving, or future grant awards from FEMA or other Federal Agencies. Debt Collection procedures will be followed as outlined in 44 CFR part 11.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Application of the Privacy Act.</E> (1) All provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, apply to this subpart. FEMA may not disclose an applicant's record except:</P>
              <P>(i) In response to a release signed by the applicant that specifies the purpose for the release, to whom the release is to be made, and that the applicant authorizes the release;</P>
              <P>(ii) In accordance with one of the published routine uses in our system of records; or</P>
              <P>(iii) As provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Under section 408(f)(2) of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174(f)(2), FEMA must share applicant information with States in order for the States to make available any additional State and local disaster assistance to individuals and households.</P>
              <P>(i) States receiving applicant information under this paragraph must protect such information in the same manner that the Privacy Act requires FEMA to protect it.</P>
              <P>(ii) States receiving such applicant information shall not further disclose the information to other entities, and shall not use it for purposes other than providing additional State or local disaster assistance to individuals and households.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Flood Disaster Protection Act requirement.</E> (1) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4106), imposes certain restrictions on federal financial assistance for acquisition and construction purposes. For the purpose of this paragraph, <E T="03">financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes</E> means assistance to an individual or household to buy, receive, build, repair or improve insurable portions of a home and/or to purchase or repair insurable contents. For a discussion of what elements of a home and contents are insurable, <E T="03">See</E> 44 CFR part 61, Insurance Coverage and Rates.</P>

              <P>(2) Individuals or households that are located in a special flood hazard area may not receive Federal Assistance for National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)—insurable real and/or personal property, damaged by a flood, unless the community in which the property is located is participating in the NFIP (<E T="03">See</E> 44 CFR part 59.1), or the exception in 42 U.S.C. 4105(d) applies. However, if the community in which the damaged property is located qualifies for and enters the NFIP during the six-month period following the declaration, the Governor's Authorized Representative may <PRTPAGE P="348"/>request a time extension for FEMA (<E T="03">See</E> § 206.112) to accept registrations and to process assistance applications in that community.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Flood insurance purchase requirement:</E> (i) As a condition of the assistance and in order to receive any Federal assistance for future flood damage to any insurable property, individuals and households named by FEMA as eligible recipients under section 408 of the Stafford Act who receive assistance, due to flood damages, for acquisition or construction purposes under this subpart must buy and maintain flood insurance, as required in 42 U.S.C. 4012a, for at least the assistance amount. This applies only to real and personal property that is in or will be in a designated Special Flood Hazard Area and that can be insured under the National Flood Insurance Program.</P>
              <P>(A) If the applicant is a homeowner, flood insurance coverage must be maintained at the address of the flood-damaged property for as long as the address exists. The flood insurance requirement is reassigned to any subsequent owner of the flood-damaged address.</P>
              <P>(B) If the applicant is a renter, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the contents for as long as the renter resides at the flood-damaged rental unit. The restriction is lifted once the renter moves from the rental unit.</P>
              <P>(C) When financial assistance is used to purchase a dwelling, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the dwelling for as long as the dwelling exists and is located in a designated Special Flood Hazard Area. The flood insurance requirement is reassigned to any subsequent owner of the dwelling.</P>
              <P>(ii) FEMA may not provide financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes to individuals or households who fail to buy and maintain flood insurance required under paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section or required by the Small Business Administration.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Environmental requirements.</E> Assistance provided under this subpart must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other environmental laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and applicable agency policy.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Historic preservation.</E> Assistance provided under this subpart generally does not have the potential to affect historic properties and thus is exempted from review in accordance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, with the exception of ground disturbing activities and construction related to §§ 206.117(b)(1)(ii) (Temporary housing), 206.117(b)(3) (Replacement housing), and 206.117(b)(4) (Permanent housing construction).</P>

              <P>“<E T="03">Caused by the disaster”</E> means as a direct result of a peril identified in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> Notice of a Presidentially-declared major disaster or emergency, the component is no longer functional.</P>
              <P>“<E T="03">Real Property Component” or “Component</E>” means each individual part of a dwelling that makes it habitable, as enumerated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Types of housing assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Temporary housing assistance</E>—(i) <E T="03">Financial assistance.</E> Eligible individuals and households may receive financial assistance to rent alternate housing resources, existing rental units, manufactured housing, recreational vehicles, or other readily fabricated dwellings. FEMA may also provide assistance for the reasonable cost of any transportation, utility hookups, or installation of a manufactured housing unit or recreational vehicle to be used for housing. This includes reimbursement for reasonable short-term lodging expenses that individuals or households incur in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.</P>
              <P>(A) FEMA will include all members of a pre-disaster household in a single registration and will provide assistance for one temporary housing residence, unless the Regional Administrator or his/her designee determines that the size or nature of the household requires that we provide assistance for more than one residence.</P>
              <P>(B) FEMA will base the rental assistance on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's current fair market rates for existing rental units. FEMA will further base the applicable rate on the household's bedroom requirement and the location of the rental unit.</P>
              <P>(C) All utility costs and utility security deposits are the responsibility of the occupant except where the utility does not meter utility services separately and utility services are a part of the rental charge.</P>
              <P>(D) The occupant is responsible for all housing security deposits. In extraordinary circumstances, the Regional Administrator or his/her designee may authorize the payment of security deposits; however, the owner or occupant must reimburse the full amount of the security deposit to the Federal Government before or at the time that the temporary housing assistance ends.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Direct assistance.</E> (A) FEMA may provide direct assistance in the form of purchased or leased temporary housing units directly to individuals or households who lack available housing resources and would be unable to make use of the assistance provided under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) FEMA will include all members of a pre-disaster household in a single application and will provide assistance for one temporary housing residence, unless the Regional Administrator or his/her designee determines that the size or nature of the household requires that we provide assistance for more than one residence.</P>
              <P>(C) Any site upon which a FEMA-provided housing unit is placed must comply with applicable State and local codes and ordinances, as well as 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and all other applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy.</P>
              <P>(D) All utility costs and utility security deposits are the responsibility of the occupant except where the utility does not meter utility services separately and utility services are a part of the rental charge.</P>
              <P>(E) FEMA-provided or funded housing units may be placed in the following locations:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A commercial site that is complete with utilities; when the Regional <PRTPAGE P="354"/>Administrator or his/her designee determines that the upgrading of commercial sites, or installation of utilities on such sites, will provide more cost-effective, timely and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources, then Federal assistance may be authorized for such actions.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A private site that an applicant provides, complete with utilities; when the Regional Administrator or his/her designee determines that the cost of installation or repairs of essential utilities on private sites will provide more cost effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources, then Federal assistance may be authorized for such actions.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A group site that the State or local government provides that accommodates two or more units and is complete with utilities; when the Regional Administrator or his/her designee determines that the cost of developing a group site provided by the State or local government, to include installation or repairs of essential utilities on the sites, will provide more cost effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources, then Federal assistance may be authorized for such actions.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A group site provided by FEMA, if the Regional Administrator or his/her designee determines that such a site would be more economical or accessible than one that the State or local government provides.</P>
              <P>(F) After the end of the 18-month period of assistance, FEMA may begin to charge up to the fair market rent rate for each temporary housing unit provided. We will base the rent charged on the number of bedrooms occupied and needed by the household. When establishing the amount of rent, FEMA will take into account the financial ability of the household.</P>
              <P>(G) We may terminate direct assistance for reasons that include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The period of assistance expired under § 206.110(e) and has not been extended;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Adequate alternate housing is available to the occupant(s);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The occupant(s) obtained housing assistance through either misrepresentation or fraud;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The occupant(s) failed to comply with any term of the lease/rental agreement or other rules of the site where the unit is located.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The occupant(s) does not provide evidence documenting that they are working towards a permanent housing plan.</P>
              <P>(H) FEMA will provide a 15 day written notice when initiating the termination of direct assistance that we provide under our lease agreements. This notice will specify the reasons for termination of assistance and occupancy, the date of termination, the procedure for appealing the determination, and the occupant's liability for such additional charges as the Regional Administrator or his/her designee deems appropriate after the termination date, including fair market rent for the unit.</P>
              <P>(I) Duplication of benefits may occur when an applicant has additional living expense insurance benefits to cover the cost of renting alternate housing. In these instances, FEMA may provide a temporary housing unit if adequate alternate housing is not available, or if doing so is in the best interest of the household and the government. We will establish fair market rent, not to exceed insurance benefits available.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Repairs.</E> (i) FEMA may provide financial assistance for the repair of real property components in an owner's primary residence if:</P>

              <P>(iii) The components that may be deemed eligible for repair assistance, and the type of repairs authorized, will vary depending upon the nature of the disaster. Repairs are limited to restoration of the dwelling to a safe and sanitary living or functioning condition.

If replacement assistance is granted, the applicant may either use the maximum amount of assistance (<E T="03">See</E> § 206.110(b) of this part) to replace the dwelling in its entirety, or may use the assistance toward the cost of acquiring a new permanent residence.</P>

              <P>(iii) Housing replacement assistance will be based on the verified disaster-related level of damage to the dwelling, or the statutory maximum (<E T="03">See</E> § 206.110(b) of this part), whichever is less.</P>

              <P>(iii) Other related funeral expenses.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Moving and storage expenses.</E> Necessary expenses and serious needs related to moving and storing personal property to avoid additional disaster damage generally include storage of personal property while disaster-related repairs are being made to the primary residence, and return of the personal property to the individual or household's primary residence.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Other.</E> Other disaster-related expenses not addressed in this section may include:</P>
              <P>(i) The purchase of a Group Flood Insurance Policy as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Other miscellaneous items or services that FEMA, in consultation with the State, determines are necessary expenses and serious needs.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Group Flood Insurance purchase.</E> Individuals identified by FEMA as eligible for “Other Needs” assistance under section 408 of the Stafford Act as <PRTPAGE P="358"/>a result of flood damage caused by a Presidentially-declared major disaster and who reside in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) may be included in a Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) established under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations at 44 CFR 61.17.</P>
              <P>(1) The premium for the GFIP is a necessary expense within the meaning of this section. FEMA or the State shall withhold this portion of the Other Needs award and provide it to the NFIP on behalf of individuals and households who are eligible for coverage. The coverage shall be equivalent to the maximum assistance amount established under section 408 of the Stafford Act.</P>
              <P>(2) FEMA or the State IHP staff shall provide the NFIP with records of individuals who received an “Other Needs” award and are to be insured through the GFIP. Records of “Other Needs” applicants to be insured shall be accompanied by payments to cover the premium amounts for each applicant for the 3-year policy term. The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each applicant. Flood insurance coverage becomes effective on the 30th day following the receipt of records of GFIP insureds and their premium payments from the State or FEMA, and such coverage terminates 36 months from the inception date of the GFIP, which is 60 days from the date of the disaster declaration.</P>
              <P>(3) Insured applicants would not be covered if they are determined to be ineligible for coverage based on a number of exclusions established by the NFIP. Therefore, once applicants/policyholders receive the Certificate of Flood Insurance that contains a list of the policy exclusions, they should review that list to see if they are ineligible for coverage. Those applicants who fail to do this may find that their property is, in fact, not covered by the insurance policy when the next flooding incident occurs and they file for losses. Once the applicants find that their damaged buildings, contents, or both, are ineligible for coverage, they should notify the NFIP in writing in order to have their names removed from the GFIP, and to have the flood insurance maintenance requirement expunged from the data-tracking system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Individual and Family Grant Program for major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Governor may request that a Federal grant be made to a State for the purpose of such State making grants to individuals or families who, as a result of a major disaster, are unable to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs for Presidentially-declared major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002 (Note that the reference to section 411 of the Stafford Act refers to prior legislation amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act 2000). The total Federal grant under this section will be equal to 75 percent of the actual cost of meeting necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals and families, plus State administrative expenses not to exceed 5 percent of the Federal grant (see paragraph (g) of this section). The total Federal grant is made only on condition that the remaining 25 percent of the actual cost of meeting individuals' or families' necessary expenses or serious needs is paid from funds made available by the State. With respect to any one major disaster, an individual or family may not receive a grant or grants under this section totaling more than $10,000 including both the Federal and State shares. The $10,000 limit will be adjusted annually, at the beginning of each fiscal year, to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. IFG assistance for damages or losses to real or personal property, or both, will be provided to individuals or families with those IFG-eligible losses totaling $201 or more; those individuals with damages or losses of $200 or less to real or personal property, or both, are ineligible. The Governor or his/her designee is responsible for the administration of the grant program. The provisions of this regulation are in accordance with 44 CFR Part 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.<PRTPAGE P="362"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The grant program is intended to provide funds to individuals or families to permit them to meet those disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs for which assistance from other means is either unavailable or inadequate. Meeting those expenses and needs as expeditiously as possible will require States to make an early commitment of personnel and resources. States may make grants in instances where the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of application to the IFG program, and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistance to the State. The grant program is not intended to indemnify disaster losses or to permit purchase of items or services which may generally be characterized as nonessential, luxury, or decorative. Assistance under this program is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determination of eligibility for welfare or other income-tested programs supported by the Federal Government, in that IFG assistance is intended to address only disaster-related needs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions used in this section.</E> (1) <E T="03">Necessary expense</E> means the cost of a serious need.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Serious need</E> means the requirement for an item or service essential to an individual or family to prevent, mitigate, or overcome a disaster-related hardship, injury, or adverse condition.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Family</E> means a social unit living together and composed of:</P>
              <P>(i) Legally married individuals or those couples living together as if they were married and their dependents; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A single person and his/her dependents; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Persons who jointly own the residence and their dependents.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Individual</E> means anyone who is not a member of a family as described above.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Dependent</E> means someone who is normally claimed as such on the Federal tax return of another, according to the Internal Revenue Code. It may also mean the minor children of a couple not living together where the children live in the affected residence with the parent who does not actually claim them on the tax return.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Expendable items</E> means consumables, as follows: linens, clothes, and basic kitchenware (pots, pans, utensils, dinnerware, flatware, small kitchen appliances).</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Assistance from other means</E> means assistance including monetary or in-kind contributions, from other governmental programs, insurance, voluntary or charitable organizations, or from any sources other than those of the individual or family. It does not include expendable items.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Owner-occupied</E> means that the residence is occupied by: The legal owner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence but is responsible for payment of taxes, maintenance of the residence, and pays no rent; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights in the residence with formal title vested in another. In States where documentation proving ownership is not recorded or does not exist, the State is required to include in its administrative plan a State Attorney General approved set of conditions describing adequate proof of ownership.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Flowage easement</E> means an area where the landowner has given the right to overflow, flood, or submerge the land to the government or other entity for a public purpose.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">National eligibility criteria.</E> In administering the IFG program, a State shall determine the eligibility of an individual or family in accordance with the following criteria;</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) To qualify for a grant under this section, an individual or family representative must:</P>
              <P>(A) Make application to all applicable available governmental disaster assistance programs for assistance to meet a necessary expense or serious need, and be determined not qualified for such assistance, or demonstrate that the assistance received does not satisfy the total necessary expense or serious need;</P>
              <P>(B) Not have previously received or refused assistance from other means for the specific necessary expense or serious need, or portion thereof, for which application is made; and</P>

              <P>(C) Certify to refund to the State that part of the grant for which assistance from other means is received, or <PRTPAGE P="363"/>which is not spent as identified in the grant award document.</P>
              <P>(ii) Individuals and families who incur a necessary expense or serious need in the major disaster area may be eligible for assistance under this section without regard to their alienage, their residency in the major disaster area, or their residency within the State in which the major disaster has been declared except that for assistance in the “housing” category, ownership and residency in the declared disaster area are required (see paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section).</P>
              <P>(iii) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, as amended, imposes certain restriction on approval of Federal financial assistance for acquisition and construction purposes. This paragraph states those requirements for the IFG program.</P>
              <P>(A) For the purpose of this paragraph, <E T="03">financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes</E> means a grant to an individual or family to repair, replace, or rebuild the insurable portions of a home, and/or to purchase or repair insurable contents. For a discussion of what elements of a home and contents are insurable, see 44 CFR part 61, Insurance Coverage and Rates.</P>
              <P>(B) A State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposes where the structure to which the grant assistance relates is located in a designated special flood hazard area which has been identified by the Assistant Administrator for Mitigation for at least 1 year as floodprone, unless the community in which the structure is located is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). However, if a community qualifies for and enters the NFIP during the 6-month period following the major disaster declaration, the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR) may request a time extension (see paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section) from the Regional Administrator for the purpose of accepting and processing grant applications in that community. The Regional Administrator or Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, as appropriate, may approve the State's request if those applicable governmental disaster assistance programs which were available during the original application period are available to the grant applicants during the extended application period.</P>
              <P>(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) The State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposes in a designated special flood hazard area in which the sale of flood insurance is available under the NFIP unless the individual or family obtains adequate flood insurance and maintains such insurance for as long as they live at that property address. The coverage shall equal the maximum grant amount established under § 411(f) of the Stafford Act. If the grantee is a homeowner, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the residence at the flood-damaged property address for as long as the structure exists if the grantee, or any subsequent owner of that real estate, ever wishes to be assisted by the Federal government with any subsequent flood damages or losses to real or personal property, or both. If the grantee is a renter, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the contents for as long as the renter resides at the flood-damaged property address. The restriction is lifted once the renter moves from the rental unit.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Individuals named by a State as eligible recipients under § 411 of the Stafford Act for an IFG program award for flood damage as a result of a Presidential major disaster declaration will be included in a Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) established under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations, at 44 CFR 61.17.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The premium for the GFIP is a necessary expense within the meaning of this section. The State shall withhold this portion of the IFG award and provide it to the NFIP on behalf of individuals and families who are eligible for coverage. The coverage shall be equivalent to the maximum grant amount established under § 411(f) of the Stafford Act.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The State IFG program staff shall provide the NFIP with records of individuals who received an IFG award and are, therefore, to be insured. Records of IFG grantees to be insured shall be accompanied by payments to cover the premium amounts for each grantee for the 3-year policy term. The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each grantee. Flood insurance <PRTPAGE P="364"/>coverage becomes effective on the 30th day following the receipt of records of GFIP insureds and their premium payments from the State, and terminates 36 months from the inception date of the GFIP, i.e., 60 days from the date of the disaster declaration.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii)</E> Insured grantees would not be covered if they are determined to be ineligible for coverage based on a number of exclusions established by the NFIP. Therefore, once grantees/policyholders receive the Certificate of Flood Insurance that contains a list of the policy exclusions, they should review that list to see if they are ineligible for coverage. Those grantees who fail to do this may find that their property is, in fact, not covered by the insurance policy when the next flooding incident occurs and they file for losses. Once the grantees find that their damaged buildings, contents, or both, are ineligible for coverage, they should notify the NFIP in writing in order to have their names removed from the GFIP, and to have the flood insurance maintenance requirement expunged from the NFIP data-tracking system. (If the grantee wishes to refer to or review a Standard Flood Insurance Policy, it will be made available by the NFIP upon request.)</P>
              <P>(D) A State may not make a grant to any individual or family who received Federal disaster assistance for flood damage occurring after September 23, 1994, if that property has already received Federal flood-disaster assistance in a disaster declared after September 23, 1994, a flood insurance purchase and maintenance requirement was levied as a condition or result of receiving that Federal disaster assistance, and flood insurance was, in fact, not maintained in an amount at least equal to the maximum IFG grant amount. However, if that property was determined to be ineligible for NFIP flood insurance coverage and is in a special flood hazard area located in a community participating in the NFIP, then the State may continue to make grants to those individuals or families that receive additional damage in all subsequent Presidentially declared major disasters involving floods.</P>
              <P>(iv) In order to comply with the President's Executive Orders on Floodplain Management (E.O. 11988) and Protection of Wetlands (E.O. 11990), the State must implement the IFG program in accordance with FEMA regulations 44 CFR part 9. That part specifies which IFG program actions require a floodplain management decisionmaking process before a grant may be made, and also specifies the steps to follow in the decisionmaking process. Should the State determine that an individual or family is otherwise eligible for grant assistance, the State shall accomplish the necessary steps in accordance with that section, and request the Regional Administrator to make a final floodplain management determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Eligible categories.</E> Assistance under this section shall be made available to meet necessary expenses or serious needs by providing essential items or services in the following categories:</P>
              <P>(i) Housing. With respect to primary residences (including mobile homes) which are owner-occupied at the time of the disaster, grants may be authorized to:</P>
              <P>(A) Repair, replace, or rebuild;</P>
              <P>(B) Provide access. When an access serves more than one individual or family, an owner-occupant whose primary residence is served by the access may be eligible for a proportionate share of the cost of jointly repairing or providing such access. The owner-occupant may combine his/her grant funds with funds made available by the other individuals or families if a joint use agreement is executed (with no cost or charge involved) or if joint ownership of the access is agreed to;</P>
              <P>(C) Clean or make sanitary;</P>
              <P>(D) Remove debris from such residences. Debris removal is limited to the minimum required to remove health or safety hazards from, or protect against additional damage to the residence;</P>

              <P>(E) Provide or take minimum protective measures required to protect such residences against the immediate threat of damage, which means that the disaster damage is causing a potential safety hazard and, if not repaired, will cause actual safety hazards from common weather or environmental events (example: additional rain, flooding, erosion, wind); and<PRTPAGE P="365"/>
              </P>
              <P>(F) Minimization measures required by owner-occupants to comply with the provision of 44 CFR part 9 (Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands), to enable them to receive assistance from other means, and/or to enable them to comply with a community's floodplain management regulations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Personal property. Proof of ownership of personal property is not required. This category includes:</P>
              <P>(A) Clothing;</P>
              <P>(B) Household items, furnishings, or appliances. If a predisaster renter receives a grant for household items, furnishings, or appliances and these items are an integral part of mobile home or other furnished unit, the predisaster renter may apply the funds awarded for these specific items toward the purchase of the furnished unit, and toward mobile home site development, towing, set-up, connecting and/or reconnecting;</P>
              <P>(C) Tools, specialized or protective clothing, and equipment which are required by an employer as a condition of employment;</P>
              <P>(D) Repairing, cleaning or sanitizing any eligible personal property item; and</P>
              <P>(E) Moving and storing to prevent or reduce damage.</P>
              <P>(iii) Transportation. Grants may be authorized to repair, replace, or provide privately owned vehicles or to provide public transportation.</P>
              <P>(iv) Medical or dental expenses.</P>
              <P>(v) Funeral expenses. Grants may include funeral and burial (and/or cremation) and related expenses.</P>
              <P>(vi) Cost of the first year's flood insurance premium to meet the requirement of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) Costs for estimates required for eligibility determinations under the IFG program. Housing and personal property estimates will be provided by the government. However, an applicant may appeal to the State if he/she feels the government estimate is inaccurate. The cost of an applicant-obtained estimate to support the appeal is not an eligible cost.</P>
              <P>(viii) Other. A State may determine that other necessary expenses and serious needs are eligible for grant assistance. If such a determination is made, the State must summarize the facts of the case and thoroughly document its findings of eligibility. Should the State require technical assistance in making a determination of eligibility, it may provide a factual summary to the Regional Administrator and request guidance. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate also may determine that other necessary expenses and serious needs are eligible for grant assistance. Following such a determination, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall advise the State, through the Regional Administrator, and provide the necessary program guidance.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Ineligible categories.</E> Assistance under this section shall not be made available for any item or service in the following categories:</P>
              <P>(i) Business losses, including farm businesses and self-employment;</P>
              <P>(ii) Improvements or additions to real or personal property, except those required to comply with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(F) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) Landscaping;</P>
              <P>(iv) Real or personal property used exclusively for recreation; and</P>
              <P>(v) Financial obligations incurred prior to the disaster.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Verification.</E> The State will be provided most verification data on IFG applicants who were not required to first apply to the SBA. The FEMA Regional Administrator shall be responsible for performing most of the required verifications in the categories of housing (to include documentation of home ownership and primary residency); personal property; and transportation (to include notation of the plate or title number of the vehicle; the State may wish to follow up on this). Certain verifications may still be required to be performed by the State, such as on late applicants or reverifications, when FEMA or its contractors are no longer available, and on medical/dental, funeral and “other” categories. Eligibility determination functions shall be performed by the State. The SBA will provide copies of verification performed by SBA staff on housing and personal property (including vehicles) for those applicants who were first required to apply to SBA. This will enable the State to make an eligibility <PRTPAGE P="366"/>determination on those applicants. When an applicant disagrees with the grant award, he/she may appeal to the State. The cost of any estimate provided by the applicant in support of his/her appeal is not eligible under the program.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">State administrative plan.</E> (1) The State shall develop a plan for the administration of the IFG program that includes, as a minimum, the items listed below.</P>
              <P>(i) Assignment of grant program responsibilities to State officials or agencies.</P>
              <P>(ii) Procedures for:</P>
              <P>(A) Notifying potential grant applicants of the availability of the program, to include the publication of application deadlines, pertinent program descriptions, and further program information on the requirements which must be met by the applicant in order to receive assistance;</P>
              <P>(B) Participating with FEMA in the registration and acceptance of applications, including late applications, up to the prescribed time limitations;</P>
              <P>(C) Reviewing verification data provided by FEMA and performing verifications for medical, dental, funeral, and “other” expenses, and also for all grant categories in the instance of late applications and appeals. FEMA will perform any necessary reverifications while its contract personnel are in the disaster area, and the State will perform any others;</P>
              <P>(D) Determining applicant eligibility and grant amounts, and notifying applicants of the State's decision;</P>
              <P>(E) Determining the requirement for flood insurance;</P>
              <P>(F) Preventing duplication of benefits between grant assistance and assistance from other means;</P>
              <P>(G) At the applicant's request, and at the State's option, reconsidering the State's determinations;</P>
              <P>(H) Processing applicant appeals, recognizing that the State has final authority. Such procedures must provide for:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The receipt of oral or written evidence from the appellate or representative;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A determination on the record; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A decision by an impartial person or board;</P>
              <P>(I) Disbursing grants in a timely manner;</P>
              <P>(J) Verifying by random sample that grant funds are meeting applicants' needs, are not duplicating assistance from other means, and are meeting floodplain management and flood insurance requirements. Guidance on the sample size will be provided by the Regional Administrator;</P>
              <P>(K) Recovering grant funds obtained fraudulently, expended for unauthorized items or services, expended for items for which assistance is received from other means, or authorized for acquisition or construction purposes where proof of purchase of flood insurance is not provided to the State. Except for those mentioned in the previous sentence, grants made properly by the State on the basis of federally sponsored verification information are not subject to recovery by the State, i.e., FEMA will not hold the State responsible for repaying to FEMA the Federal share of those grants. The State is responsible for its 25 percent share of those grants. As an attachment to its voucher, the State must identify each case where recovery actions have been taken or are to be taken, and the steps taken or to be taken to accomplish recovery;</P>
              <P>(L) Conducting any State audits that might be performed in compliance with the Single Audit Act of 1984; and ensuring that appropriate corrective action is taken within 6 months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;</P>
              <P>(M) Reporting to the Regional Administrator, and to the Federal Coordinating Officer as required; and</P>
              <P>(N) Reviewing and updating the plan each January.</P>
              <P>(iii) National eligibility criteria as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iv) Provisions for compliance with 44 CFR part 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments; 44 CFR part 11, Claims; the State's own debt collection procedures; and all applicable Federal laws and regulations.<PRTPAGE P="367"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Pertinent time limitations for accepting applications, grant award activities, and administrative activities, to comply with Federal time limitations.</P>
              <P>(vi) Provisions for specifically identifying, in the accounts of the State, all Federal and State funds committed to each grant program; for repaying the loaned State share as of the date agreed upon in the FEMA-State Agreement; and for immediately returning, upon discovery, all Federal funds that are excess to program needs.</P>
              <P>(vii) Provisions for safeguarding the privacy of applicants and the confidentiality of information, except that the information may be provided to agencies or organizations who require it to make eligibility decisions for assistance programs, or to prevent duplication of benefits, to State agencies responsible for audit or program review, and to FEMA or the Government Accountability Office for the purpose of making audits or conducting program reviews.</P>
              <P>(viii) A section identifying the management and staffing functions in the IFG program, the sources of staff to fill these functions, and the management and oversight responsibilities of:</P>
              <P>(A) The GAR;</P>
              <P>(B) The department head responsible for the IFG program;</P>
              <P>(C) The Grant Coordinating Officer, i.e., the State official assigned management responsibility for the IFG program; and</P>
              <P>(D) The IFG program manager, where management responsibilities are assigned to such a person on a day-to-day basis.</P>
              <P>(2) The Governor or his/her designee may request the Regional Administrator to provide technical assistance in the preparation of an administrative plan to implement this program.</P>
              <P>(3) The Governor shall submit a revised State administrative plan each January to the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator shall review and approve the plan annually. In each disaster for which assistance under this section is requested, the Regional Administrator shall request the State to prepare any amendments required to meet current policy guidance. The Regional Administrator must then work with the State until the plan and amendment(s) are approved.</P>
              <P>(4) The State shall make its approved administrative plan part of the State emergency plan, as described in subpart A of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">State initiation of the IFG program.</E> To make assistance under this section available to disaster victims, the Governor must, either in the request of the President for a major disaster declaration or by separate letter to the Regional Administrator, express his/her intention to implement the program. This expression of intent must include an estimate of the size and cost of the program. In addition, this expression of intent represents the Governor's agreement to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That the program is needed to satisfy necessary expenses and serious needs of disaster victims which cannot otherwise be met;</P>
              <P>(2) That the State will pay its 25 percent share of all grants to individuals and families;</P>
              <P>(3) That the State will return immediately upon discovery advanced Federal funds that exceed actual requirements;</P>
              <P>(4) To implement an administrative plan as identified in paragraph (e) of this section;</P>
              <P>(5) To implement the grant program throughout the area designated as eligible for assistance by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate; and</P>
              <P>(6) To maintain close coordination with and provide reports to the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Funding.</E> (1) The Regional Administrator may obligate the Federal share of the IFG program based upon the determination that:</P>
              <P>(i) The Governor has indicated the intention to implement the program, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The State's administrative plan meets the requirements of this section and current policy guidance; and</P>

              <P>(iii) There is no excess advance of the Federal share due FEMA from a prior IFG program. The State may eliminate any such debt by paying it immediately, or by accepting an offset of the owed funds against other funds payable <PRTPAGE P="368"/>by FEMA to the State. When the excess Federal share has been repaid, the Regional Administrator may then obligate funds for the Federal share for the current disaster.</P>
              <P>(2) The Regional Administrator may increase the State's letter of credit to meet the Federal share of program needs if the above conditions are met. The State may withdraw funds for the Federal share in the amount made available to it by the Regional Administrator. Advances to the State are governed by 44 CFR 13.21, Payment.</P>
              <P>(3) The Regional Administrator may lend to the State its share in accordance with subpart A of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(4) Payable costs are governed by 44 CFR 13.22, Allowable Costs, and the associated OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments. Also, the costs must be in accordance with the national eligibility criteria stated in paragraph (d) of this section, and the State's administrative plan, as stated in paragraph (e) of this section. The Federal contribution to this program shall be 75 percent of program costs and shall be made in accordance with 44 CFR 13.25, Matching or Cost-Sharing.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Final payment.</E> Final payment to the State for the Federal share of the IFG program plus administrative costs, is governed by 44 CFR l3.21, Payment, and 44 CFR 13.50, Closeout. The voucher is Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement). A separate voucher for the State share will be prepared, to include all disaster programs for which the State is requesting a loan of the nonFederal share. The FEMA Regional Administrator will analyze the voucher and approve, disapprove, or suspend approval until deficiencies are corrected.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Audits.</E> The State should perform the audits required by the Single Audit Act of 1984. Refer to 44 CFR part 13. All programs are subject to Federal audit.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Time limitations.</E> (1) In the administration of the IFG program:</P>
              <P>(i) The Governor shall indicate his/her intention to implement the IFG program no later than 7 days following the day on which the major disaster was declared and in the manner set forth in paragraph (f) of this section;</P>

              <P>(ii) Applications shall be accepted from individuals or families for a period of 60 days following the declaration, and for no longer than 30 days thereafter when the State determines that extenuating circumstances beyond the applicants' control (such as, but not limited to, hospitalization, illness, or inaccessibility to application centers) prevented them from applying in a timely manner. <E T="03">Exception:</E> If applicants exercising their responsibility to first apply to the Small Business Administration do so after SBA's deadline, and SBA accepts their case for processing because of “substantial causes essentially beyond the control of the applicant,” and provides a formal decline or insufficient loan based on lack of repayment ability, unsatisfactory credit, or unsatisfactory experience with prior loans (i.e., the reasons a loan denial client would normally be eligible for IFG assistance), then such an application referred to the State by the SBA is considered as meeting the IFG filing deadline. The State may then apply its own criteria in determining whether to process the case for grant assistance. The State automatically has an extension of time to complete the processing, eligibility, and disbursement functions. However, the State must still complete all administrative activity within the 270-day period described in this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The State shall complete all grant award activity, including eligibility determinations, disbursement, and disposition of State level appeals, within 180 days following the declaration date. The Regional Administrator shall suspend all grant awards disbursed after the specified completion date; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The State shall complete all administrative activities and submit final reports and vouchers to the Regional Administrator within 90 days of the completion of all grant award activity.</P>

              <P>(2) The GAR may submit a request with appropriate justification for the extension of any time limitation. The Regional Administrator may approve the request for a period not to exceed 90 days. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate <PRTPAGE P="369"/>may approve any request for a further extension of the time limitations.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Appeals</E>—(1) <E T="03">Bills for collection (BFC's).</E> The State may appeal the issuance of a BFC by the Regional Administrator. Such an appeal shall be made in writing within 60 days of the issuance of the bill. The appeal must include information justifying why the bill is incorrect. The Regional Administrator shall review the material submitted and notify the State, in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, of his/her decision. Interest on BFC's starts accruing on the date of issuance of the BFC, but is not charged if the State pays within 30 days of issuance. If the State is successful in its appeal, interest will not be charged; if unsuccessful, interest is due and payable, as above.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other appeals.</E> The State may appeal any other decision of the regional Administrator. Such appeals shall be made in writing within 60 days of the Regional Administrator 's decision. The appeal must include information justifying a reversal of the decision. The Regional Administrator shall review the material submitted and notify the State, in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, of his/her decision.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Appeals to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</E> The State may further appeal the Regional Administrator 's decisions to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. This appeal shall be made in writing within 60 days of the Regional Administrator 's decision. The appeal must include information justifying a reversal of the decision. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall review the material submitted and notify the State, in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, of his/her decision.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Exemption from garnishment.</E> All proceeds received or receivable under the IFG program shall be exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release, or waiver. No rights under this provision are assignable or transferable. The above exemptions will not apply to the requirement imposed by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(K) of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Debt collection.</E> If the State has been unable to recover funds as stated in paragraph (e)(1)(k) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall institute debt collection activities against the individual according to the procedures outlined in 44 CFR part 11, Claims, and 44 CFR 13.52, Collection of Amounts Due.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disaster legal services.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Legal services, including legal advice, counseling, and representation in non fee-generating cases, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, may be provided to low-income individuals who require them as a result of a major disaster. For the purpose of this section, <E T="03">low-income individuals</E> means those disaster victims who have insufficient resources to secure adequate legal services, whether the insufficiency existed prior to or results from the major disaster. In cases where questions arise about the eligibility of an individual for legal services, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative shall make a determination.</P>
              <P>(b) Disaster legal services shall be provided free to such individuals. Fee-generating cases shall not be accepted by lawyers operating under these regulations. For purposes of this section, a fee-generating case is one which would not ordinarily be rejected by local lawyers as a result of its lack of potential remunerative value. Where any question arises as to whether a case is fee-generating as defined in this section, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative, after any necessary consultation with local or State bar associations, shall make the determination. Any fee-generating cases shall be referred by the Regional Administrator or his/her representative to private lawyers, through existing lawyer referral services, or, where that is impractical or impossible, the Regional Administrator may provide a list of lawyers from which the disaster victim may choose. Lawyers who have rendered voluntary legal assistance under these regulations are not precluded from taking fee-generating cases referred to them in this manner while in their capacity as private lawyers.</P>

              <P>(1) Disaster-related home repair and rebuilding assistance to families for permanent housing purposes, including site acquisition and development, relocation of residences out of hazardous areas, assistance with costs associated with temporary housing or permanent rehousing (e.g., utility deposits, access, transportation, connection of utilities, etc.);</P>
              <P>(2) Disaster-related unmet needs of families who are unable to obtain adequate assistance under the Act or from other sources. Such assistance may include but is not limited to: health and safety measures; evacuation costs; assistance delineated in the Act or other Federal, State, local, or volunteer programs; hazard mitigation or floodplain management purposes; and assistance to self-employed persons (with no employees) to reestablish their businesses; and</P>

              <P>(3) Other services which alleviate human suffering and promote the well being of disaster victims. For example, services to the elderly, to children, or to handicapped persons, such as transportation, recreational programs, provision of special ramps, or hospital or home visiting services. The funds may be provided to individual disaster victims, or to benefit a group of disaster victims.<PRTPAGE P="377"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditions for use of the Cora Brown Fund.</E> (1) The Cora Brown Fund is available only when the President declares that a major disaster or emergency exists under the Act, only in areas designated as eligible for Federal disaster assistance through notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and only at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The fund is limited to the initial endowment plus accrued interest, and this assistance program will cease when the fund is used up.</P>
              <P>(2) A disaster victim normally will receive no more than $2,000 from this fund in any one declared disaster unless the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that a larger amount is in the best interest of the disaster victim and the Federal Government. Funds to provide service which benefit a group may be awarded in an amount determined by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, based on the Regional Administrator 's recommendation.</P>
              <P>(3) The fund may not be used in a way that is inconsistent with other federally mandated disaster assistance or insurance programs, or to modify other generally applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(4) Funds awarded to a disaster victim may be provided by FEMA jointly to the disaster victim and to a State or local agency, or volunteer organization, to enable such an agent to assist in providing the approved assistance to an applicant. Example: Repair funds may be provided jointly to an applicant and the Mennonite Disaster Service, who will coordinate the purchase of supplies and provide the labor.</P>
              <P>(5) Money from this fund will not duplicate assistance for which a person is eligible from other sources.</P>
              <P>(6) In order to comply with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234), as amended, any award for acquisition or construction purposes shall carry a requirement that any adequate flood insurance policy be purchased and maintained. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall determine what is adequate based on the purpose of the award.</P>
              <P>(7) The fund shall be administered in an equitable and impartial manner without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or economic status.</P>
              <P>(8) Funds awarded to a disaster victim from this fund may be combined with funds from other sources.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Administrative procedures.</E> (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall be responsible for awarding funds and authorizing disbursement.</P>
              <P>(2) The Chief Financial Officer shall be responsible for fund accountability and, in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, for liaison with the Department of the Treasury concerning the investment of excess money in the fund pursuant to the provisions contained in section 601 of the Act.</P>

              <P>(3) Each FEMA Regional Administrator may submit requests to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on a disaster victim's behalf by providing documentation describing the needs of the disaster victim, a verification of the disaster victim's claim, a record of other assistance which has been or will be available for the same purpose, and his/her recommendation as to the items and the amount. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall review the facts and make a determination. If the award amount is below $2,000, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may appoint a designee to have approval authority; approval authority of $2,000 or above shall be retained by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall notify the Chief Financial Officer of a decision for approval, and the Chief Financial Officer shall order a check to be sent to the disaster victim (or jointly to the disaster victim and an assistance organization), through the Regional Administrator. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall also notify the Regional Administrator of the decision, whether for approval or <PRTPAGE P="378"/>disapproval. The Regional Administrator shall notify the disaster victim in writing, identify any award as assistance from the Cora Brown Fund, and advise the recipient of appeal procedures.</P>
              <P>(4) If the award is to be for a service to a group of disaster victims, the Regional Administrator shall submit his/her recommendation and supporting documentation to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate (or his/her designee if the award is below $2,000), who shall review the information and make a determination. In cases of approval, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall request the Chief Financial Officer to send a check to the intended recipient or provider, as appropriate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall notify the Regional Administrator of the decision. The Regional Administrator shall notify a representative of the group in writing.</P>
              <P>(5) The Chief Financial Officer shall process requests for checks, shall keep records of disbursements and balances in the account, and shall provide the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate with quarterly reports.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Audits.</E> The Inspector General of DHS may audit the use of money in this account to determine whether the funds are being administered according to these regulations and whether the financial management of the account is adequate. The Inspector General shall provide his/her findings to the Administrator, for information, comments and appropriate action. A copy shall be provided to the Chief Financial Officer for the same purpose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duplication of benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section establishes the policies for implementing section 312 of the Stafford Act, entitled Duplication of Benefits. This section relates to assistance for individuals and families.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Government policy.</E> (1) Federal agencies providing disaster assistance under the Act or under their own authorities triggered by the Act, shall cooperate to prevent and rectify duplication of benefits, according to the general policy guidance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The agencies shall establish appropriate agency policies and procedures to prevent duplication of benefits.</P>
              <P>(2) Major disaster and emergency assistance provided to individuals and families under the Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided by States, local governments, and disaster assistance organizations, is not considered as income or a resource when determining eligibility for or benefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource-tested programs. Examples of federally funded income assistance or resource-tested programs are the food stamp program and welfare assistance programs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">FEMA policy.</E> It is FEMA policy:</P>
              <P>(1) To prevent duplication of benefits between its own programs and insurance benefits, and between its own programs and other disaster assistance. Assistance under the Act may be provided in instances where the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of application and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistance to the agency providing the Federal assistance;</P>
              <P>(2) To examine a debt resulting from duplication to determine that the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions to remedy duplication which has occurred when other assistance has become available;</P>
              <P>(3) To assure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits, by consulting with other Federal agencies and by performing selected quality control reviews, that the other disaster relief agencies establish and follow policies and procedures to prevent and remedy duplication among their programs, other programs, and insurance benefits; and</P>

              <P>(4) To coordinate the effort of agencies providing assistance so that each agency understands the prevention and remedial policies of the others and is able to fulfill its own responsibilities regarding duplication of benefits.<PRTPAGE P="379"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Guidance to prevent duplication of benefits.</E> (1) Delivery sequence. FEMA provides the following policy and procedural guidance to ensure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits.</P>
              <P>(i) Duplication occurs when an agency has provided assistance which was the primary responsibility of another agency, and the agency with primary responsibility later provides assistance. A delivery sequence establishes the order in which disaster relief agencies and organizations provide assistance. The specific sequence, in accordance with the mandates of the assistance programs, is to be generally followed in the delivery of assistance.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the delivery sequence has been disrupted, the disrupting agency is responsible for rectifying the duplication. The delivery sequence pertains to that period of time in the recovery phase when most of the traditional disaster assistance programs are available.</P>
              <P>(2) The delivery sequence is, in order of delivery:</P>
              <P>(i) Volunteer agencies' emergency assistance (except expendable items such as clothes, linens, and basic kitchenware); insurance (including flood insurance);</P>
              <P>(ii) Housing assistance pursuant to section 408 of the Stafford Act.</P>
              <P>(iii) Small Business Administration and Farmers Home Administration disaster loans;</P>
              <P>(iv) Other Needs assistance, pursuant to section 408 of the Stafford Act or its predecessor program, the Individual and Family Grant Program.</P>
              <P>(v) Volunteer agencies' “additional assistance” programs; and</P>
              <P>(vi) The “Cora Brown Fund.”</P>
              <P>(3) Two significant points about the delivery sequence are that:</P>
              <P>(i) Each assistance agency should, in turn, offer and be responsible for delivering assistance without regard to duplication with a program later in the sequence; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The sequence itself determines what types of assistance can duplicate other assistance (i.e., a Federal program can duplicate insurance benefits, however, insurance benefits cannot duplicate the Federal assistance). An agency's position in the sequence determines the order in which it should provide assistance and what other resources it must consider before it does so.</P>
              <P>(4) If following the delivery sequence concept would adversely affect the timely receipt of essential assistance by a disaster victim, an agency may offer assistance which is the primary responsibility of another agency. There also may be cases when an agency (Agency B) delivers assistance which is normally the primary responsibility of another agency (Agency A) because Agency A has, for good cause, denied assistance. After the assistance is delivered, Agency A reopens the case. If the primary response Agency A then provides assistance, that Agency A is responsible for coordinating with Agency B to either:</P>
              <P>(i) Assist Agency B in preventing the duplication of benefits, or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case where the disaster victim has refused assistance from Agency A, notify Agency B that it must recover assistance previously provided.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Program guidance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Programs under the Act vs. other agency assistance.</E> (i) In making an eligibility determination, the FEMA Regional Administrator, in the case of federally operated programs, or the State, in the case of State operated programs, shall determine whether assistance is the primary responsibility of another agency to provide, according to the delivery sequence; and determine whether that primary response agency can provide assistance in a timely way.</P>
              <P>(ii) If it is determined that timely assistance can be provided by the agency with primary responsibility, refrain from providing assistance under the Act. If it is determined that assistance from the agency with primary responsibility will be delayed, assistance under the Act may be provided, but then must be recovered from the applicant when the other assistance becomes available.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Programs under the Act vs. insurance.</E> In making an eligibility determination, the FEMA Regional Administrator or State shall:</P>

              <P>(i) Remind the applicant about his/her responsibility to pursue an adequate settlement. The applicant must provide information concerning insurance recoveries.<PRTPAGE P="380"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Determine whether the applicant's insurance settlement will be sufficient to cover the loss or need without disaster assistance; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Determine whether insurance benefits (including flood insurance) will be provided in a timely way. Where flood insurance is involved, the Regional Administrator shall coordinate with the Federal Insurance Administration. The purpose of this coordination is to obtain information about flood insurance coverage and settlements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Random sample.</E> Each disaster assistance agency is responsible for preventing and rectifying duplication of benefits under the coordination of the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) and the general authority of section 312. To determine whether duplication has occurred and established procedures have been followed, the Regional Administrator shall, within 90 days after the close of the disaster assistance programs application period, for selected disaster declarations, examine on a random sample basis, FEMA's and other government and voluntary agencies' case files and document the findings in writing.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved.</E> If duplication is discovered, the Regional Administrator shall determine whether the duplicating agency followed its own remedial procedures.</P>
              <P>(i) If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was successful in correcting the duplication, the Regional Administrator will take no further action. If the agency was not successful in correcting the duplication, and the Regional Administrator is satisfied that the duplicating agency followed its remedial procedures, no further action will be taken.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of benefits procedures, or the Regional Administrator is not satisfied that the procedures were followed in an acceptable manner, then the Regional Administrator shall provide an opportunity for the agency to take the required corrective action. If the agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities for remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall notify the recipient of the excess assistance, and after examining the debt, if it is determined that the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions, then take those recovery actions in conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case in the random sample (or larger universe, at the Regional Administrator's discretion).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Duplication when assistance under other authorities is involved.</E> When the random sample shows evidence that duplication has occurred and corrective action is required, the Regional Administrator and the FCO shall urge the duplicating agency to follow its own procedures to take corrective action, and shall work with the agency toward that end. Under his/her authority in section 312, the Regional Administrator shall require the duplicating agency to report to him/her on its attempt to correct the duplications identified in the sample.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Recovering FEMA funds: debt collection.</E> Funds due to FEMA are recovered in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security's Debt Collection Regulations (6 CFR part 11—Claims).</P>

Such $120,000 amount shall be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Small projects.</E> When the approved estimate of costs for an individual project is less than $120,000, Federal funding shall equal the Federal share of the approved estimate of eligible costs.

Federal funding for such improved projects shall be limited to the Federal share of the approved estimate of eligible costs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternate projects.</E> In any case where a subrecipient determines that the public welfare would not be best served by restoring a damaged public facility or the function of that facility, the recipient may request that the Regional Administrator approve an alternate project.</P>

              <P>(2) A detailed justification for the delay and a projected completion date. The Regional Administrator shall review the request and make a determination. The recipient shall be notified of the Regional Administrator's determination in writing. If the Regional Administrator approves the request, the letter shall reflect the approved completion date and any other requirements the Regional Administrator may determine necessary to ensure that the new completion date is met. If the Regional Administrator denies the time extension request, the recipient may, upon completion of the project, be reimbursed for eligible project costs incurred only up to the latest approved completion date. If the project is not completed, no Federal funding will be provided for that project.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cost Overruns.</E> (1) During the execution of approved work a subrecipient may find that the actual project costs exceed the approved Project Worksheet estimates. Such cost overruns normally fall into the following three categories:</P>
              <P>(i) Variations in unit prices;</P>
              <P>(ii) Change in the scope of eligible work; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Delays in timely starts or completion of eligible work.</P>
              <P>(2) The subrecipient must evaluate each cost overrun and, when justified, submit a request for additional funding through the recipient to the Regional Administrator for a final determination. All requests for the Regional Administrator's approval will contain sufficient documentation to support the eligibility of all claimed work and costs. The recipient must include a written recommendation when forwarding the request. The Regional Administrator will notify the recipient in writing of the final determination. FEMA will not normally review an overrun for an individual small project. The normal procedure for small projects will be that when a subrecipient discovers a significant overrun related to the total final cost for all small projects, the subrecipient may submit an appeal for additional funding in accordance with § 206.206, within 60 days following the completion of all its small projects.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Progress reports.</E> Progress reports will be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator quarterly. The Regional Administrator and recipient shall negotiate the date for submission of the first report. Such reports <PRTPAGE P="385"/>will describe the status of those projects on which a final payment of the Federal share has not been made to the recipient and outline any problems or circumstances expected to result in noncompliance with the approved grant conditions.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Small Projects.</E> Final payment of the Federal share of these projects will be made to the recipient upon approval of the Project Worksheet. The recipient will make payment of the Federal share to the subrecipient as soon as practicable after Federal approval of funding. Before the closeout of the disaster contract, the recipient must certify that all such projects were completed in accordance with FEMA approvals and that the State contribution to the non-Federal share, as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement, has been paid to each subrecipient. Such certification is not required to specify the amount spent by a subrecipient on small projects. The Federal payment for small projects shall not be reduced if all of the approved funds are not spent to complete a project. However, failure to complete a project may require that the Federal payment be refunded.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Large projects.</E> (1) The recipient shall make an accounting to the Regional Administrator of eligible costs for each approved large project. In submitting the accounting the recipient shall certify that reported costs were incurred in the performance of eligible work, that the approved work was completed, that the project is in compliance with the provisions of the FEMA-State Agreement, and that payments for that project have been made in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305. Each large project shall be submitted as soon as practicable after the subrecipient has completed the approved work and requested payment.</P>
              <P>(2) The Regional Administrator shall review the accounting to determine the eligible amount of reimbursement for each large project and approve eligible costs. If a discrepancy between reported costs and approved funding exists, the Regional Administrator may conduct field reviews to gather additional information. If discrepancies in the claim cannot be resolved through a field review, a Federal audit may be conducted. If the Regional Administrator determines that eligible costs exceed the initial approval, he/she will obligate additional funds as necessary.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When the State and local government lack the capability to perform or to contract for eligible emergency work and/or debris removal, under sections 402(1) and (4), 403, 407, 502(a)(1), (5) and (7) of the Act, the recipient may request that the work be accomplished by a Federal agency. Such assistance is subject to the cost sharing provisions outlined in § 206.203(b) of this subpart. Direct Federal assistance is also subject to the eligibility criteria contained in Subpart H of these regulations. FEMA will reimburse other Federal agencies in accordance with Subpart A of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for assistance.</E> All requests for direct Federal assistance shall be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator and shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A written agreement that the State will:</P>
              <P>(i) Provide without cost to the United States all lands, easements and rights-of-ways necessary to accomplish the approved work;</P>
              <P>(ii) Hold and save the United States free from damages due to the requested work, and shall indemnify the Federal Government against any claims arising from such work;</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide reimbursement to FEMA for the nonFederal share of the cost of such work in accordance with the provisions of the FEMA-State Agreement; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Assist the performing Federal agency in all support and local jurisdictional matters.</P>
              <P>(2) A statement as to the reasons the State and the local government cannot perform or contract for performance of the requested work.</P>
              <P>(3) A written agreement from an eligible applicant that such applicant will be responsible for the items in subparagraph (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, in the event that a State is legally unable to provide the written agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Implementation.</E> (1) If the Regional Administrator approves the request, a mission assignment will be issued to the appropriate Federal agency. The mission assignment letter to the agency will define the scope of eligible work, the estimated cost of the eligible work and the billing period frequency. The Federal agency must not exceed the approved funding limit without the authorization of the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) If all or any part of the requested work falls within the statutory authority of another Federal agency, the Regional Administrator shall not approve that portion of the work. In such case, the unapproved portion of the request will be referred to the appropriate agency for action.</P>

              <P>(3) If an impact-State requests assistance in providing evacuation and sheltering support outside an impact-State, FEMA may directly reimburse a host-State for such eligible costs through a grant to a host-State under an impact-State's declaration, consistent with § 206.202(f)(1). FEMA may <PRTPAGE P="388"/>award a grant to a host-State when FEMA determines that a host-State has sufficient capability to meet some or all of the sheltering and/or evacuation needs of an impact-State, and a host-State agrees in writing to provide such support to an impact-State.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time limitation.</E> The time limitation for completion of work by a Federal agency under a mission assignment is 60 days after the President's declaration. Based on extenuating circumstances or unusual project requirements, the Regional Administrator may extend this time limitation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Project management.</E> (1) The performing Federal agency shall ensure that the work is completed in accordance with the Regional Administrator's approved scope of work, costs and time limitations. The performing Federal agency shall also keep the Regional Administrator and recipient advised of work progress and other project developments. It is the responsibility of the performing Federal agency to ensure compliance with applicable Federal, State and local legal requirements. A final inspection report will be completed upon termination of all direct Federal assistance work. Final inspection reports shall be signed by a representative of the performing Federal agency and the State. Once the final eligible cost is determined (including Federal agency overhead), the State will be billed for the nonFederal share of the mission assignment in accordance with the cost sharing provisions of the FEMA-State Agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) Pursuant to the agreements provided in the request for assistance the recipient shall assist the performing Federal agency in all State and local jurisdictional matters. These matters include securing local building permits and rights of entry, control of traffic and pedestrians, and compliance with local building ordinances.</P>

Such facilities are also eligible for assistance from FEMA under the Stafford Act, and recipients shall accept applications from local educational agencies for assistance under the Stafford Act.</P>
              <P>(3) The exception does not cover payment of increased current operating expenses or replacement of lost revenues as provided in 20 U.S.C. 241-1(a) and implemented by 34 CFR 219.14. Such assistance shall continue to be granted and administered by the Department of Education.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mitigation planning.</E> In order to receive assistance under this section, the State or Indian Tribal government applying to FEMA as a recipient must have in place a FEMA approved State or Tribal Mitigation Plan, as applicable, in accordance with 44 CFR part 201.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Private nonprofit facilities.</E> Eligible private nonprofit facilities may receive funding under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The facility provides critical services, which include power, water (including water provided by an irrigation organization or facility in accordance with § 206.221(e)(3)), sewer services, wastewater treatment, communications, emergency medical care, fire department services, emergency rescue, and nursing homes; or</P>
              <P>(2) The private nonprofit organization not falling within the criteria of § 206.226(c)(1) has applied for a disaster loan under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.636(b)) and</P>
              <P>(i) The Small Business Administration has declined the organization's application; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Has eligible damages greater than the maximum amount of the loan for which it is eligible, in which case the excess damages are eligible for FEMA assistance.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Standards.</E> For the costs of Federal, State, and local repair or replacement standards which change the predisaster construction of facility to be eligible, the standards must:</P>
              <P>(1) Apply to the type of repair or restoration required;</P>
              <FP>(Standards may be different for new construction and repair work)</FP>
              <P>(2) Be appropriate to the predisaster use of the facility;</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Be found reasonable, in writing, and formally adopted and implemented by the State or local government on or before the disaster declaration date or be a legal Federal requirement applicable to the type of restoration.</P>
              <P>(ii) This paragraph (d) applies to local governments on January 1, 1999 and to States on January 1, 2000. Until the respective applicability dates, the standards must be in writing and formally adopted by the applicant prior to project approval or be a legal Federal or State requirement applicable to the type of restoration.</P>
              <P>(4) Apply uniformly to all similar types of facilities within the jurisdiction of owner of the facility; and</P>
              <P>(5) For any standard in effect at the time of a disaster, it must have been enforced during the time it was in effect.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Hazard mitigation.</E> In approving grant assistance for restoration of facilities, the Regional Administrator may require cost effective hazard mitigation measures not required by applicable standards. The cost of any requirements for hazard mitigation placed on restoration projects by FEMA will be an eligible cost for FEMA assistance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Repair vs. replacement.</E> (1) A facility is considered repairable when disaster damages do not exceed 50 percent <PRTPAGE P="395"/>of the cost of replacing a facility to its predisaster condition, and it is feasible to repair the facility so that it can perform the function for which it was being used as well as it did immediately prior to the disaster.</P>
              <P>(2) If a damaged facility is not repairable in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, approved restorative work may include replacement of the facility. The applicant may elect to perform repairs to the facility, in lieu of replacement, if such work is in conformity with applicable standards. However, eligible costs shall be limited to the less expensive of repairs or replacement.</P>
              <P>(3) An exception to the limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be allowed for facilities eligible for or on the National Register of Historic Properties. If an applicable standard requires repair in a certain manner, costs associated with that standard will be eligible.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Relocation.</E> (1) The Regional Administrator may approve funding for and require restoration of a destroyed facility at a new location when:</P>
              <P>(i) The facility is and will be subject to repetitive heavy damage;</P>
              <P>(ii) The approval is not barred by other provisions of title 44 CFR; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The overall project, including all costs, is cost effective.</P>
              <P>(2) When relocation is required by the Regional Administrator, eligible work includes land acquisition and ancillary facilities such as roads and utilities, in addition to work normally eligible as part of a facility reconstruction. Demolition and removal of the old facility is also an eligible cost.</P>
              <P>(3) When relocation is required by the Regional Administrator, no future funding for repair or replacement of a facility at the original site will be approved, except those facilities which facilitate an open space use in accordance with 44 CFR part 9.</P>
              <P>(4) When relocation is required by the Regional Administrator, and, instead of relocation, the applicant requests approval of an alternate project [see § 206.203(d)(2)], eligible costs will be limited to 90 percent of the estimate of restoration at the original location excluding hazard mitigation measures.</P>
              <P>(5) If relocation of a facility is not feasible or cost effective, the Regional Administrator shall disapprove Federal funding for the original location when he/she determines in accordance with 44 CFR parts 9, 10, 201, or subpart M of this part 206, that restoration in the original location is not allowed. In such cases, an alternative project may be applied for.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Equipment and furnishings.</E> If equipment and furnishings are damaged beyond repair, comparable items are eligible as replacement items.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Library books and publications.</E> Replacement of library books and publications is based on an inventory of the quantities of various categories of books or publications damaged or destroyed. Cataloging and other work incidental to replacement are eligible.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Beaches.</E> (1) Replacement of sand on an unimproved natural beach is not eligible.</P>
              <P>(2) Improved beaches. Work on an improved beach may be eligible under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) The beach was constructed by the placement of sand (of proper grain size) to a designed elevation, width, and slope; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A maintenance program involving periodic renourishment of sand must have been established and adhered to by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Restrictions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Alternative use facilities.</E> If a facility was being used for purposes other than those for which it was designed, restoration will only be eligible to the extent necessary to restore the immediate predisaster alternate purpose.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inactive facilities.</E> Facilities that were not in active use at the time of the disaster are not eligible except in those instances where the facilities were only temporarily inoperative for repairs or remodeling, or where active use by the applicant was firmly established in an approved budget or the owner can demonstrate to FEMA's satisfaction an intent to begin use within a reasonable time.</P>

              <P>(a) Sections 311 and 406(d) of the Stafford Act, and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, set forth certain insurance requirements which apply to disaster assistance provided by FEMA. The requirements of this subpart apply to all assistance provided pursuant to section <PRTPAGE P="397"/>406 of the Stafford Act with respect to any major disaster declared by the President after November 23, 1988.</P>
              <P>(b) Insurance requirements prescribed in this subpart shall apply equally to private nonprofit (PNP) facilities which receive assistance under section 406 of the Act. PNP organizations shall submit the necessary documentation and assurances required by this subpart to the recipient.</P>
              <P>(c) Actual and anticipated insurance recoveries shall be deducted from otherwise eligible costs, in accordance with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) The full coverage available under the standard flood insurance policy from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) will be subtracted from otherwise eligible costs for a building and its contents within the special flood hazard area in accordance with § 206.252.</P>
              <P>(e) The insurance requirements of this subpart should not be interpreted as a substitute for various hazard mitigation techniques which may be available to reduce the incidence and severity of future damage.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Assistance</E> means any form of a Federal grant under section 406 of the Stafford Act to replace, restore, repair, reconstruct, or construct any facility and/or its contents as a result of a major disaster.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Building</E> means a walled and roofed structure, other than a gas, or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Community</E> means any State or political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization, or Alaskan Native Village or authorized native organization which has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for the areas within its jurisdiction.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Special flood hazard area</E> means an area having special flood, mudslide, and/or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by FEMA as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V1-30 VE, V, M, or E. “Special flood hazard area” is synonymous with “special hazard area”, as defined in 44 CFR part 59.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Standard Flood Insurance Policy</E> means the flood insurance policy issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator, or by a Write-Your-Own Company pursuant to 44 CFR 62.23.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Insurance requirements for facilities damaged by flood.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Where an insurable building damaged by flooding is located in a special flood hazard area identified for more than one year by the Administrator, assistance pursuant to section 406 of the Stafford Act shall be reduced. The amount of the reduction shall be the maximum amount of the insurance proceeds which would have been received had the building and its contents been fully covered by a standard flood insurance policy.</P>
              <P>(b) The reduction stated above shall not apply to a PNP facility which could not be insured because it was located in a community not participating in the NFIP. However, the provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 prohibit approval of assistance for the PNP unless the community agrees to participate in the NFIP within six months after the major disaster declaration date, and the required flood insurance is purchased.</P>
              <P>(c) Prior to approval of a Federal grant for the restoration of a facility and its contents which were damaged by a flood, the recipient shall notify the Regional Administrator of any entitlement to an insurance settlement or recovery. The Regional Administrator shall reduce the eligible costs by the amount of insurance proceeds which the recipient receives.</P>

              <P>(d) The recipient or subrecipient is required to obtain and maintain flood insurance in the amount of eligible disaster assistance, as a condition of receiving Federal assistance that may be <PRTPAGE P="398"/>available. This requirement also applies to insurable flood damaged facilities located outside a special flood hazard area when it is reasonably available, adequate, and necessary. However, the Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and amounts of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner. The requirement to purchase flood insurance is waived when eligible costs for an insurable facility do not exceed $5,000.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Insurance requirements for facilities damaged by disasters other than flood.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Prior to approval of a Federal grant for the restoration of a facility and its contents which were damaged by a disaster other than flood, the recipient shall notify the Regional Administrator of any entitlement to insurance settlement or recovery for such facility and its contents. The Regional Administrator shall reduce the eligible costs by the actual amount of insurance proceeds relating to the eligible costs.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Assistance under section 406 of the Stafford Act will be approved only on the condition that the recipient obtain and maintain such types and amounts of insurance as are reasonable and necessary to protect against future loss to such property from the types of hazard which caused the major disaster. The extent of insurance to be required will be based on the eligible damage that was incurred to the damaged facility as a result of the major disaster. The Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(2) Due to the high cost of insurance, some applicants may request to insure the damaged facilities under a blanket insurance policy covering all their facilities, an insurance pool arrangement, or some combination of these options. Such an arrangement may be accepted for other than flood damages. However, if the same facility is damaged in a similar future disaster, eligible costs will be reduced by the amount of eligible damage sustained on the previous disaster.</P>
              <P>(c) The Regional Administrator shall notify the recipient of the type and amount of insurance required. The recipient may request that the State Insurance Commissioner review the type and extent of insurance required to protect against future loss to a disaster-damaged facility, the Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(d) The requirements of section 311 of the Stafford Act are waived when eligible costs for an insurable facility do not exceed $5,000. The Regional Administrator may establish a higher waiver amount based on hazard mitigation initiatives which reduce the risk of future damages by a disaster similar to the one which resulted in the major disaster declaration which is the basis for the application for disaster assistance.</P>
              <P>(e) The recipient shall provide assurances that the required insurance coverage will be maintained for the anticipated life of the restorative work or the insured facility, whichever is the lesser.</P>
              <P>(f) No assistance shall be provided under section 406 of the Stafford Act for any facility for which assistance was provided as a result of a previous major disaster unless all insurance required by FEMA as a condition of the previous assistance has been obtained and maintained.</P>

              <P>This subpart implements the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) (Pub. L. 97-348) as that statute applies to disaster relief granted to individuals and State and local governments under the Stafford Act. CBRA prohibits new expenditures and new financial assistance within the Coastal Barrier Resources <PRTPAGE P="399"/>System (CBRS) for all but a few types of activities identified in CBRA. This subpart specifies what actions may and may not be carried out within the CBRS. It establishes procedures for compliance with CBRA in the administration of disaster assistance by FEMA.</P>

              <P>It shall be the policy of FEMA to achieve the goals of CBRA in carrying out disaster relief on units of the Coastal Barrier Resources System. It is FEMA's intent that such actions be consistent with the purpose of CBRA to minimize the loss of human life, the wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and the damage to fish, wildlife and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and to consider the means and measures by which the long-term conservation of these fish, wildlife, and other natural resources may be achieved under the Stafford Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the definitions set forth in part 206 of subchapter D are applicable to this subject.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Consultation</E> means that process by which FEMA informs the Secretary of the Interior through his/her designated agent of FEMA proposed disaster assistance actions on a designated unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources System and by which the Secretary makes comments to FEMA about the appropriateness of that action. Approval by the Secretary is not required in order that an action be carried out.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Essential link</E> means that portion of a road, utility, or other facility originating outside of the system unit but providing access or service through the unit and for which no alternative route is reasonably available.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Existing facility</E> on a unit of CBRS established by Public Law 97-348 means a publicly owned or operated facility on which the start of a construction took place prior to October 18, 1982, and for which this fact can be adequately documented. In addition, a legally valid building permit or equivalent documentation, if required, must have been obtained for the construction prior to October 18, 1982. If a facility has been substantially improved or expanded since October 18, 1982, it is not an existing facility.

              <SUBJECT>Loan program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may make a Community Disaster Loan to any local government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need for Federal financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of loan.</E> The amount of the loan is based upon need, not to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs, but shall not exceed $5 million. The term <E T="03">fiscal year</E> as used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interest rate.</E> The interest rate is the rate for five year maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States, adjusted to the nearest <FR>1/8</FR> percent.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time limitation.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following that year. Only one loan may be approved under section <PRTPAGE P="405"/>417(a) for any local government as the result of a single disaster.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Term of loan.</E> The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider requests for an extensions of loans based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the Community Disaster Loan recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment.

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of loan funds.</E> The local government shall use the loaned funds to carry on existing local government functions of a municipal operation character or to expand such functions to meet disaster-related needs. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities.

              <P>(a) The local government shall submit the financial information required by FEMA in the application for a Community Disaster Loan and in the application for loan cancellation, if submitted, and comply with the assurances on the application, the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, and these regulations. The local government shall send all loan application, loan administration, loan cancellation, and loan settlement correspondence through the GAR and the FEMA Regional Office to the FEMA Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</P>
              <P>(b) The GAR shall certify on the loan application that the local government can legally assume the proposed indebtedness and that any proceeds will be used and accounted for in compliance with the FEMA-State Agreement for the major disaster. States are encouraged to take appropriate pre-disaster action to resolve any existing State impediments which would preclude a local government from incurring the increased indebtedness associated with a loan in order to avoid protracted delays in processing loan application requests in major disasters or emergencies.</P>
              <P>(c) The Regional Administrator or designee shall review each loan application or loan cancellation request received from a local government to ensure that it contains the required documents and transmit the application to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. He/she may submit appropriate recommendations to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</P>
              <P>(d) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, or a designee, shall execute a Promissory Note with the local government, and the FEMA Finance Center, shall administer the loan until repayment or cancellation is completed and the Promissory Note is discharged.</P>

              <P>(e) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve or disapprove each loan request, taking into consideration the information provided in the <PRTPAGE P="406"/>local government's request and the recommendations of the GAR and the Regional Administrator. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve or disapprove a request for loan cancellation in accordance with the criteria for cancellation in these regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) The Chief Financial Officer shall establish and maintain a financial account for each outstanding loan and disburse funds against the Promissory Note.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Local government.</E> (1) The local government must be located within the area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate as eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.</P>
              <P>(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential municipal operating services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan eligibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or emergency, must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, and must not be in arrears with respect to any payments due on previous loans. Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local government and a review of financial information and supporting documentation accompanying the application.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.</E> The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential municipal services provided prior to the disaster;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Demonstrated need for financial assistance.</E> The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions. The criteria used in making this determination include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;</P>
              <P>(iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;</P>
              <P>(iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;</P>
              <P>(v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);</P>
              <P>(vi) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;</P>
              <P>(vii) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;</P>
              <P>(viii) Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential municipal services; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Danger of municipal insolvency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> (1) The local government shall submit an application for a Community Disaster Loan through the <PRTPAGE P="407"/>GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see § 206.367(c)).</P>
              <P>(2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government's application. The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy for the submission. The Governor's Authorized Representative may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial requirements.</E> (1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see § 206.364(b)(2)) and shall include a Summary of Revenue Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results—Cash Position, a Debt History, Tax Assessment Data, Financial Projections, Other Information, a Certification, and the Assurances listed on the application.</P>
              <P>(i) Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's most recent financial statement must accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each application for a Community Disaster Loan must also include:</P>
              <P>(A) A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and</P>
              <P>(B) A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinance, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating budget.</E> For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term “operating budget” to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operating budget increases.</E> Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Revenue and assessment information.</E> The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due. Tax revenues assessed but not collected, or other revenues which the local government chooses to forgive, stay, or otherwise not exercise the right to collect, are not a legitimate revenue loss for purposes of evaluating the loan application.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Estimated disaster-related expense.</E> Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated. These are discussed in § 206.366(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal review.</E> (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a community disaster loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial <PRTPAGE P="408"/>loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental function as the result of the disaster.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Resubmission of application.</E> If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be resubmitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Community disaster loan.</E> (1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or</P>
              <P>(ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Promissory note.</E> (i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see § 206.364(d)(2)(ii)). The applicant should indicate its funding requirements on the Schedule of Loan Increments on the Note.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the Promissory Note, the local government must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, to cover the principal amount of the Note. The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan administration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Funding.</E> (1) FEMA will disburse funds to the local government when requested, generally in accordance with the Schedule of Loan Increments in the Promissory Note. As funds are disbursed, interest will accrue against each disbursement.</P>
              <P>(2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local government shall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submitted previously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the level and frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in the disbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days prior to the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt of the funds. A sinking fund should be established to amortize the debt.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial management.</E> (1) Each local government with an approved Community Disaster Loan shall establish necessary accounting records, consistent with local government's financial management system, to account for loan funds received and disbursed and to provide an audit trail.</P>
              <P>(2) FEMA auditors, State auditors, the GAR, the Regional Administrator, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, and the Comptroller General of the United States or their duly authorized representatives shall, for the purpose of audits and examination, have access to any books, documents, papers, and records that pertain to Federal funds, equipments, and supplies received under these regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Loan servicing.</E> (1) The applicant annually shall submit to FEMA copies of its annual financial reports (operating statements, balance sheets, etc.) for the fiscal year of the major disaster, and for each of the 3 subsequent fiscal years.</P>

              <P>(2) The Disaster Assistance Directorate, will review the loan periodically. The purpose of the reevaluation is to determine whether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operating budgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustment of the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds.<PRTPAGE P="409"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall provide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis. The recipient will notify FEMA of any changes of the responsible municipal official who executed the Promissory Note.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inactive loans.</E> If no funds have been disbursed from the Treasury, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA. However, since only one loan may be approved, cancellation precludes submission of a second loan application request by the same local government for the same disaster.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan cancellation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Policies.</E> (1) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses for a municipal operating character. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets that term <E T="03">operating budget</E> to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.</P>
              <P>(2) If the tax and other revenues rates or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the 3 fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax and other revenue rates and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received. This may result in decreasing the potential for loan cancellations.</P>
              <P>(3) If the local government's fiscal year is changed during the “full 3 year period following the disaster” the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period.</P>
              <P>(4) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.</P>
              <P>(5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite predisaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.</E> (1) For purpose of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, such as police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance, and other expenses normally budgeted for the general fund, as defined by the Municipal Finance Officers Association.</P>
              <P>(2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.</P>
              <P>(3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.</P>

              <P>(ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to <PRTPAGE P="410"/>meet disaster temporary housing requirements.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.</P>
              <P>(iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.</P>
              <P>(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Community Disaster Loan purposes:</P>
              <P>(i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.</P>
              <P>(iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.</P>
              <P>(iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's project application.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cancellation application.</E> A local government which has drawn loan funds from the Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.</P>
              <P>(1) Financial information submitted with the application shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and the 3 subsequent fiscal years;</P>
              <P>(ii) Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for each of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must include copies of the local government's annual financial reports, including operating statements balance sheets and related consolidated and individual presentations for each fund account. In addition, the local government must include an explanatory statement when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellation form differ from those in the supporting financial reports.</P>
              <P>(iii) The following additional information concerning annual real estate property taxes pertaining to the community for each of the above fiscal years:</P>
              <P>(A) The market value of the tax base (dollars);</P>
              <P>(B) The assessment ratio (percent);</P>
              <P>(C) The assessed valuation (dollars);</P>
              <P>(D) The tax levy rate (mils);</P>
              <P>(E) Taxes levied and collected (dollars).</P>
              <P>(iv) Audit reports for each of the above fiscal years certifying to the validity of the Operating Statements. The financial statements of the local government shall be examined in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent certified public accountants. The report should not include recommendations concerning loan cancellation or repayment.</P>
              <P>(v) Other financial information specified in the Application for Loan Cancellation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Narrative justification.</E> The application may include a narrative presentation to amplify the financial material accompanying the application and to present any extenuating circumstances which the local government wants the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate to consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination.</E> (1) If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, when determined necessary, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that all or part of the Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the principal amount which is canceled will become a grant, and the related interest will be forgiven. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid immediately and that, if immediate repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local <PRTPAGE P="411"/>government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settling the indebtedness on timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.</P>
              <P>(2) A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other disaster-related grants or other disaster assistance. However, no cancellation may be made that would result in a duplication of benefits to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(3) The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance with § 206.367.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, the local government may submit any additional information in support of the application within 60 days of the date of disapproval. The decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee on the submission is final.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Prepayments.</E> The local government may make prepayments against loan at any time without any prepayment penalty.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repayment.</E> To the extent not otherwise cancelled, Community Disaster Loan funds become due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note. The note shall include the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) The term of a loan made under this program is 5 years, unless extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. Interest will accrue on outstanding cash from the actual date of its disbursement by the Treasury.</P>
              <P>(2) The interest amount due will be computed separately for each Treasury disbursement as follows: I = P × R × T, where I = the amount of simple interest, P = the principal amount disbursed; R = the interest rate of the loan; and, T = the outstanding term in years from the date of disbursement to date of repayment, with periods less than 1 year computed on the basis of 365 days/year. If any portion of the loan is cancelled, the interest amount due will be computed on the remaining principal with the shortest outstanding term.</P>
              <P>(3) Each payment made against the loan will be applied first to the interest computed to the date of the payment, and then to the principal. Prepayments of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any time and shall be applied to the installments last to become due under the loan and shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to pay the remaining installments.</P>
              <P>(4) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may defer payments of principal and interest until FEMA makes its final determination with respect to any Application for Loan Cancellation which the borrower may submit. However, interest will continue to accrue.</P>
              <P>(5) Any costs incurred by the Federal Government in collecting the note shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan, bear interest at the same rate as the loan, and be immediately due without demand.</P>
              <P>(6) In the event of default on this note by the borrower, the FEMA claims collection officer will take action to recover the outstanding principal plus related interest under Federal debt collection authorities, including administrative offset against other Federal funds due the borrower and/or referral to the Department of Justice for judicial enforcement and collection.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional time.</E> In unusual circumstances involving financial hardship, the local government may request an additional period of time beyond the original 10 year term to repay the indebtedness. Such request may be approved by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The local government must submit documented evidence that it has applied for the same credit elsewhere and that such credit is not available at a rate equivalent to the current Treasury rate.</P>

              <P>(2) The principal amount shall be the original uncancelled principal plus related interest.<PRTPAGE P="412"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The interest rate shall be the Treasury rate in effect at the time the new Promissory Note is executed but in no case less than the original interest rate.</P>
              <P>(4) The term of the new Promissory Note shall be for the settlement period requested by the local government but not greater than 10 years from the date the new note is executed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Sections 206.370 through 206.377 provide procedures for local governments and State and Federal officials concerning the Special Community Disaster Loans program under section 417 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5184), the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005, Public Law 109-88, and the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Public Law 109-234.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Sections 206.370 through 206.377 apply only to Special Community Disaster Loans issued under the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005, Public Law 109-88, and the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Public Law 109-234.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may make a Special Community Disaster Loan to any local government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need for Federal financial assistance in order to provide essential services.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of loan.</E> The amount of the loan is based upon need, not to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs. The term fiscal year as used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interest rate.</E> The interest rate is the rate for five year maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States. If an applicant can demonstrate <E T="03">unusual circumstances involving financial hardship</E>, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a rate equal to the five year maturity rate plus 1 per centum, adjusted to the nearest <FR>1/8</FR> percent, and further reduced by one-half.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time limitation.</E> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following that year.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Term of loan.</E> The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider a request for an extension of a loan based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) of the Stafford Act normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment (see § 206.377(c)).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of loan funds.</E> The local government shall use the loaned funds to assist in providing essential services. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the non-Federal share of any Federal program, including those under the Stafford Act.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Relation to other assistance.</E> Any Special Community Disaster Loans including cancellations of loans made under this subpart shall not reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance provided <PRTPAGE P="413"/>under the authority of the Stafford Act or this part.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Cancellation.</E> The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local government during the three full fiscal years following the disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed disaster-related municipal operating expenses.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The local government shall submit the financial information required by FEMA in the application for a Community Disaster Loan or other format specified by FEMA and comply with the assurances on the application, the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, the application for loan cancellation, if submitted, and §§ 206.370 through 206.377. The local government shall send all loan application, loan administration, loan cancellation, and loan settlement correspondence through the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR) and the FEMA Regional Office to the Director of the Public Assistance Division.</P>
              <P>(b) The GAR shall certify on the loan application that the local government can legally assume the proposed indebtedness and that any proceeds will be used and accounted for in compliance with the FEMA-State Agreement for the major disaster. States are encouraged to take appropriate pre-disaster action to resolve any existing State impediments which would preclude a local government from incurring the increased indebtedness associated with a loan in order to avoid protracted delays in processing loan application requests resulting from major disasters.</P>
              <P>(c) The Regional Administrator or designee shall review each loan application or loan cancellation request received from a local government to ensure that it contains the required documents and transmit the application to the Director of the Public Assistance Division. He/she may also submit appropriate recommendations to the Director of the Public Assistance Division.</P>
              <P>(d) The Director of the Public Assistance Division or a designee, shall execute a Promissory Note with the local government and shall administer the loan until repayment or cancellation is completed and the Promissory Note is discharged.</P>
              <P>(e) The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall approve or disapprove each loan request, taking into consideration the information provided in the local government's request and the recommendations of the GAR and the Regional Administrator. The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall approve or disapprove a request for loan cancellation in accordance with the criteria for cancellation in these regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) The FEMA Chief Financial Officer shall establish and maintain a financial account for each outstanding loan and disburse funds against the Promissory Note.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Local government.</E> (1) The local government must be located within the area eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.</P>
              <P>(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Special Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Stafford Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan eligibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or <PRTPAGE P="414"/>emergency, and it must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to provide essential municipal services. Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local government and a review of financial information and supporting documentation accompanying the application.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.</E> The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential services provided prior to the disaster;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Demonstrated need for financial assistance.</E> The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions. The criteria used in making this determination may include some or all of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;</P>
              <P>(iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;</P>
              <P>(iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;</P>
              <P>(v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);</P>
              <P>(vi) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;</P>
              <P>(vii) Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential services; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Danger of municipal insolvency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> (1) The local government shall submit an application for a Special Community Disaster Loan through the GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see § 206.377(c)).</P>
              <P>(2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government's application. The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy of the submission. The GAR may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial requirements.</E> (1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) and shall include a Summary of Revenue Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results—Cash Position, and certification and assurances requested by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.</P>

              <P>(i) Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's <PRTPAGE P="415"/>most recent financial statement must, unless impracticable, accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each application for a Special Community Disaster Loan must also include:</P>
              <P>(A) A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and</P>
              <P>(B) A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinances, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating budget.</E> For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term “operating budget” to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operating budget increases.</E> Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Revenue and assessment information.</E> The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Estimated disaster-related expense.</E> Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal review.</E> (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance as the result of the disaster to provide essential municipal services.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Resubmission of application.</E> If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be submitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Special Community Disaster Loan.</E> (1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or</P>
              <P>(ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Promissory note.</E> (i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section). The applicant should indicate its funding requirements on the Schedule of Loan Increments on the Note.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the Promissory Note, the local government must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, to cover the principal amount of the Note. The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver of requirements.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this or other sections promulgated pursuant to Public Law 109-88, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may, upon the request of an applicant or loan recipient, waive any specific application requirement or financial reporting requirement (see, <PRTPAGE P="416"/>e.g., § 206.375(a)(2)) upon a finding by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate that the effects of the major disaster prevent the applicant from fulfilling the application requirement and that waiving the requirements would be consistent with the purposes of the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan administration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Funding.</E> (1) FEMA will disburse funds to the local government when requested, generally in accordance with the Schedule of Loan Increments in the Promissory Note. As funds are disbursed, interest will accrue against each disbursement.</P>
              <P>(2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local government shall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submitted previously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the level and frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in the disbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days prior to the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt of the funds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial management.</E> (1) Each local government with an approved Special Community Disaster Loan shall establish necessary accounting records, consistent with local government's financial management system, to account for loan funds received and disbursed and to provide an audit trail.</P>
              <P>(2) FEMA auditors, State auditors, the GAR, the Regional Administrator, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, and the Comptroller General of the United States or their duly authorized representatives shall, for the purpose of audits and examination, have access to any books, documents, papers, and records that pertain to Federal funds, equipments, and supplies received under §§ 206.370 through 206.377.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Loan servicing.</E> (1) The applicant annually shall submit to FEMA copies of its annual financial reports (operating statements, balance sheets, etc.) for the fiscal year of the major disaster, and for each of the 3 subsequent fiscal years.</P>
              <P>(2) FEMA will review the loan periodically. The purpose of the reevaluation is to determine whether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operating budgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustment of the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds.</P>
              <P>(3) FEMA shall provide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis. The recipient will notify FEMA of any changes of the responsible municipal official who executed the Promissory Note.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inactive loans.</E> If no funds have been disbursed from the loan program, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan cancellation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Director of the Public Assistance Division determines that revenues of the local government during the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For loan cancellation purposes,</P>
              <P>(1) “Operating budget” means actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.</P>
              <P>(2) “Revenue” means any source of income from taxes, fees, fines, and other sources of income, and will be recognized only as they become susceptible to accrual (measurable and available).</P>

              <P>(3) “Three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster” means either a 36-<PRTPAGE P="417"/>month period beginning on September 1, 2005, or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the disaster, at the applicant's discretion.</P>
              <P>(4) “Operating expenses” means those expenses and expenditures incurred as a result of performing services, including salaries and benefits, contractual services, and commodities. Capital expenditures and debt service payments and capital leases are not considered operating expenses. Under accrual accounting, expenses are recognized as soon as a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Revenue Calculation procedures.</E> (1) If the tax rates and other revenues or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the three full fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax rates and other revenues and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received.</P>
              <P>(2) At the applicant's discretion, the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster is either a 36-month period beginning on September 1, 2005 or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the disaster. If the applicant's fiscal year is changed within the 36 months immediately following the disaster, the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period. Should the applicant elect the 36-month period beginning September 1, 2005, FEMA will prorate the revenues and expenses for the partial years based on the applicant's annual financial statements.</P>
              <P>(3) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of property taxes that are transferred to other funds for Debt Service or Pension Obligations funding will not be excluded from the calculation of the operating budget or from expenditures in calculation of the operating deficit, to the extent that the property tax revenues in the General Fund are less than they were pre-disaster. FEMA will consider the impact of the loss of property tax revenue in Debt Service or Pension Funds (non-operating funds) if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The entity experienced a loss of property tax revenue as a result of the disaster and the assessed value during the three years following the disaster, in the aggregate, is less than the pre-disaster assessed value;</P>
              <P>(ii) the entity has a property tax cap limitation on the ability to raise property taxes post-disaster; and</P>
              <P>(iii) the property taxes are levied through the General Operating Fund and transfers for obligations mandated by law are made to fund Debt Service or Pension Obligations which result in the entity experiencing a reduction of property tax revenues in the General Fund.</P>
              <P>(5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite pre-disaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.</P>
              <P>(6) The provisions of this section apply to all Special Community Disaster loans issued from the dates of enactment of Public Law 109-88 and Public Law 109-234.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.</E> (1) For purposes of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, including but not limited to police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance.</P>

              <P>(2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital <PRTPAGE P="418"/>projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.</P>
              <P>(3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housing requirements.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.</P>
              <P>(iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.</P>
              <P>(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Special Community Disaster Loan purposes:</P>
              <P>(i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Stafford Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5172).</P>
              <P>(ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.</P>
              <P>(iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.</P>
              <P>(iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's Project Application.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cancellation application.</E> A local government which has drawn loan funds from the U.S. Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Prepayments.</E> The local government may make prepayments against loan at any time without any prepayment penalty.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repayment.</E> To the extent not otherwise cancelled, loan funds become due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note. The note shall include the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) The term of a loan made under this program is 5 years, unless extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. Interest will accrue on outstanding cash from the actual date of its disbursement by FEMA or FEMA's designated Disbursing Agency.</P>
              <P>(2) The interest amount due will be computed separately for each Treasury disbursement as follows: I = P X R X T, where I = the amount of simple interest, P = the principal amount disbursed; R = the interest rate of the loan; and, T = the outstanding term in years from the date of disbursement to date of repayment, with periods less than 1 year computed on the basis of 365 days/year. If any portion of the loan is cancelled, the interest amount due will be computed on the remaining principal with the shortest outstanding term.</P>
              <P>(3) Each payment made against the loan will be applied first to the interest computed to the date of the payment, and then to the principal. Prepayments of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any time and shall be applied to the installments last to become due under the loan and shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to pay the remaining installments.</P>
              <P>(4) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may defer payments of principal and interest until FEMA makes its final determination with respect to any Application for Loan Cancellation which the borrower may submit. However, interest will continue to accrue.</P>

              <P>(5) Any costs incurred by the Federal Government in collecting the note shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan, bear interest at the same rate as the loan, and be immediately due without demand.<PRTPAGE P="420"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) In the event of default on this note by the borrower, the FEMA claims collection officer will take action to recover the outstanding principal plus related interest under Federal debt collection authorities, including administrative offset against other Federal funds due the borrower and/or referral to the Department of Justice for judicial enforcement and collection.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional time.</E> In unusual circumstances involving financial hardship, the local government may request an additional period of time beyond the original 10 year term to repay the indebtedness. Such request may be approved by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The local government must submit documented evidence that it has applied for the same credit elsewhere and that such credit is not available at a rate equivalent to the current Treasury rate.</P>
              <P>(2) The principal amount shall be the original uncancelled principal plus related interest less any payments made.</P>
              <P>(3) The interest rate shall be the Treasury rate in effect at the time the new Promissory Note is executed but in no case less than the original interest rate. A reduced rate may not be applied if was it was not previously applied to the loan.</P>
              <P>(4) The term of the new Promissory Note shall be for the settlement period requested by the local government but not greater than 10 years from the date the new note is executed.</P>

Cost overruns which can be met without additional Federal funds, or which can be met by offsetting cost underruns on other projects, need not be submitted to the Regional Administrator for approval, so long as the full scope of work on all affected projects can still be met. For cost overruns which exceed Federal obligated funds and which require additional Federal funds, the Governor's Authorized Representative shall evaluate each cost overrun and shall submit a request with a recommendation to the Regional Administrator for a determination. The applicant's justification for additional costs and other pertinent material shall accompany the request. The Regional Administrator shall notify the Governor's Authorized Representative in writing of the determination and process a supplement, if necessary. All requests that are not justified shall be denied by the Governor's Authorized Representative.

Grantees and subgrantees may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project or planning proposal. These costs can only be incurred during the open application period of the grant program. Costs associated with implementation of the activity but incurred prior to grant award are not eligible.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section describes how FEMA determines the amount of funds that it will contribute under this part for management costs for PA and/or HMGP for a particular major disaster or emergency.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Lock-in.</E> FEMA will determine the amount of funds that it will make available for management costs by a lock-in, which will act as a ceiling for funds available to a grantee, including its subgrantees.</P>
            <P>(1) Not earlier than 30 days and not later than 35 days from the date of declaration, FEMA will provide the grantee preliminary lock-in amount(s) for management costs based on the projections at that time of the Federal share for financial assistance for PA and HMGP, as applicable. In accordance with § 207.7(c), FEMA will obligate 25 percent of the estimated lock-in amount(s) to the grantee.</P>
            <P>(2) For planning purposes, FEMA will revise the lock-in amount(s) at 6 months after the date of the declaration. In accordance with § 207.7(e), FEMA may obligate interim amount(s) to the grantee.</P>
            <P>(3) FEMA will determine the final lock-in amount(s) 12 months after date of declaration or after determination of the final HMGP lock-in ceiling, whichever is later. FEMA will obligate the remainder of the lock-in amount(s) to the grantee in accordance with § 207.7(f).</P>
            <P>(4) Rates. (i) For major disaster declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for PA based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs for financial assistance pursuant to sections 403, 406, and 407 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170b, 5172, and 5173, respectively, but not including direct Federal assistance. For major disaster declarations on or after November 13, 2007, the PA rate will be 3.34 percent.</P>
            <P>(ii) For major disaster declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for HMGP based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs under section 404 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170c. For major disaster declarations on or after November 13, 2007, the HMGP rate will be 4.89 percent.</P>
            <P>(iii) For emergency declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for PA based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs for financial assistance (sections 502 and 503 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5192 and 5193, respectively), but not including direct Federal assistance. For emergency declarations on or after November 13, 2007 the rate will be 3.90 percent.</P>
            <P>(c) The dollar amount provided to a grantee for management cost funds for a single declaration will not exceed 20,000,000, except as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) The grantee must justify in writing to the Regional Administrator any requests to change the amount of the lock-in or the cap, extend the time period before lock-in, or request an interim obligation of funding at the time of the 6-month lock-in adjustment. The Regional Administrator will recommend to the Chief Financial Officer whether to approve the extension, change, or interim obligation. Extensions, changes to the lock-in, or interim obligations will not be made without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer.</P>

            <P>(e) The Chief Financial Officer may change the amount of the lock-in or the cap, or extend the time before lock-<PRTPAGE P="431"/>in, if the Chief Financial Officer determines that the projections used to determine the lock-in were inaccurate to such a degree that the change to the lock-in would be material, or for other reasons in his or her discretion that may reasonably warrant such changes. The Chief Financial Officer will not make such changes without consultation with the grantee and the Regional Administrator.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial Funding Request Submission.</E> Upon notification of the preliminary lock-in amount(s) for management costs based on the Federal share of the projected eligible program costs for financial assistance at that time for PA and HMGP, as applicable, the grantee must submit its initial management cost funding request to the Regional Administrator. FEMA must receive the initial funding request before it will provide any management cost funds under this part.</P>
            <P>(1) For PA management costs, funding requests shall be submitted using a PW.</P>
            <P>(2) For HMGP management costs, funding requests shall be submitted using an HMGP project narrative.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Request Documentation.</E> The grantee is required to submit, no later than 120 days after the date of declaration, documentation to support costs and activities for which the projected lock-in for management cost funding will be used. In extraordinary circumstances, FEMA may approve a request by a grantee to submit support documentation after 120 days. FEMA will work with the grantee to approve or reject the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. If the request is rejected, the grantee will have 30 days to resubmit it for reconsideration and approval. FEMA will not obligate the balance of the management costs lock-in pursuant to a final funding request as described in paragraph (f) of this section or any interim amounts as allowed under paragraph (e) of this section unless the grantee's documentation is approved. The documentation must include:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of activities, personnel requirements, and other costs for which the grantee will use management cost funding provided under this part;</P>
            <P>(2) The grantee's plan for expending and monitoring the funds provided under this part and ensuring sufficient funds are budgeted for grant closeout; and</P>

            <P>(3) An estimate of the percentage or amount of pass-through funds for management costs provided under this part that the grantee will make available to subgrantees, and the basis, criteria, or formula for determining the subgrantee percentage or amount (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, number of projects, complexity of projects, X percent to any subgrantee).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Interim Funding Request.</E> If the grantee can justify a bona fide need for <PRTPAGE P="432"/>an additional obligation of management cost funds at 6 months, the grantee may submit a request to the Regional Administrator. Any interim obligations by FEMA must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer and will not exceed an amount equal to 10 percent of the 6-month lock-in amount, except in extraordinary circumstances.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Final Funding Request.</E> Upon notification of the final lock-in amount(s), the grantee must submit a final management cost funding request to the Regional Administrator. Any necessary revisions to supporting documentation must be attached to the final funding request.</P>

The grantee is responsible for ensuring that subgrantees meet all program and administrative requirements.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Period of availability.</E> (1) For major disaster declarations, the grantee may expend management cost funds for allowable costs for a maximum of 8 years from the date of the major disaster declaration or 180 days after the latest performance period date of a non-management cost PA PW or HMGP project narrative, respectively, whichever is sooner.</P>
            <P>(2) For emergency declarations, the grantee may expend management cost funds for allowable costs for a maximum of 2 years from the date of the emergency declaration or 180 days after the latest performance period of a non-management cost PA PW, whichever is sooner.</P>
            <P>(3) The period of availability may be extended only at the written request of the grantee, with the recommendation of the Regional Administrator, and with the approval of the Chief Financial Officer. The grantee must include a justification in its request for an extension, and must demonstrate that there is work in progress that can be completed within the extended period of availability. In no case will an extended period of availability allow more than 180 days after the expiration of any performance period extensions granted under PA or HMGP for project completion. FEMA will deobligate any funds not liquidated by the grantee in accordance with 2 CFR 200.309 and 200.343(b).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> The grantee must provide quarterly progress reports on management cost funds to the Regional Administrator as required by the FEMA-State Agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Closeout.</E> The grantee has primary responsibility for the closeout tasks associated with both the program and subgrantee requirements. Complying with each program's performance period requirement, the grantee must conduct final inspections for projects, reconcile subgrantee expenditures, resolve negative audit findings, obtain final reports from subgrantees and reconcile the closeout activities of subgrantees with PA and HMGP grant awards.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Audit requirements.</E> Uniform audit requirements in 2 CFR 200.500-200.520 apply to all assistance provided under this part.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Document retention.</E> In compliance with State law and procedures and with 2 CFR 200.333-200.337, grantees must retain records, including source documentation to support expenditures/costs incurred for management costs, for 3 years from the date of submission of the final Financial Status Report to FEMA that is required for PA and HMGP. The grantee is responsible for resolving questioned costs that may result from audit findings during the 3-year-record-retention period and returning any disallowed costs from ineligible activities.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section describes how FEMA provides administrative and management cost funding for PA and HMGP for major disasters or emergencies declared before November 13, 2007.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible direct costs.</E> Eligible direct costs to complete approved activities are governed by 2 CFR parts 200 and <PRTPAGE P="433"/>3002. The eligible direct costs for administration and management of the program are divided into two categories as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Grantee.</E> (i) <E T="03">Statutory administrative costs.</E> FEMA may provide funds to the grantee to cover the extraordinary costs incurred in preparing project worksheets or applications, final inspection reports, quarterly reports, final audits, and related field inspections by State employees, including overtime pay and per diem and travel expenses, but not including regular time for such employees. FEMA will base the funds on the following percentages of the total amount of assistance provided (Federal share) for all subgrantees in the State under sections 403, 404, 406, 407, 502, and 503 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5170b, 5170c, 5172, 5173, 5192, and 5193, respectively):</P>
            <P>(A) For the first 100,000 of total assistance provided (Federal share), 3 percent of such assistance.</P>
            <P>(B) For the next 900,000, 2 percent of such assistance.</P>
            <P>(C) For the next 4,000,000, 1 percent of such assistance.</P>
            <P>(D) For assistance over $5,000,000, one-half of 1 percent of such assistance.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">State management administrative costs.</E> Except for the items listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, other administrative costs will be paid in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E—Cost Principles. The grantee and FEMA will share such costs under the cost share provisions of applicable PA and HMGP regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Subgrantee.</E> The grantee may provide funds to the subgrantee to cover necessary costs of requesting, obtaining, and administering Federal disaster assistance subgrants, based on the following percentages of net eligible costs under sections 403, 404, 406, 407, 502, and 503 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5170b, 5170c, 5172, 5173, 5192, and 5193, respectively), for an individual applicant (applicants in this context include State agencies):</P>
            <P>(i) For the first $100,000 of net eligible costs, 3 percent of such costs.</P>
            <P>(ii) For the next $900,000, 2 percent of such costs.</P>
            <P>(iii) For the next $4,000,000, 1 percent of such costs.</P>
            <P>(iv) For those costs over $5,000,000, one-half of 1 percent of such costs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible indirect costs:</E> (1) <E T="03">Grantee.</E> Indirect costs of administering the disaster program are eligible in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002 if the grantee provides FEMA with a current Indirect Cost Rate Agreement approved by its Cognizant Agency.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Subgrantee.</E> No indirect costs of a subgrantee are separately eligible because the percentage allowance in paragraph (b)(2) of this section covers necessary costs of requesting, obtaining and administering Federal assistance.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Availability.</E> (1) For major disaster declarations, FEMA will reimburse grantee eligible costs as described in this section at (b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1) for a maximum of 8 years from the date of the major disaster declaration or 180 days after the latest performance period date of a non-management cost PA PW or predecessor form or HMGP project narrative, respectively, whichever is sooner.</P>
            <P>(2) For emergency declarations, FEMA will reimburse grantee eligible costs as described in this section at (b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1) for a maximum of 2 years from the date of the emergency declaration or 180 days after the latest performance period of a non-management cost PA PW or predecessor form, whichever is sooner.</P>
            <P>(3) The reimbursement of grantee eligible costs as described in this section at (b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1) may be provided by FEMA after the periods of availability described in this section only at the written request of the grantee, with the recommendation of the Regional Administrator, and with the approval of the Chief Financial Officer. The grantee must include a justification in its request for further reimbursement, and must demonstrate that there is work in progress that can be completed within the extended period of reimbursement. In no case will reimbursement be provided after 180 days after the expiration of any performance period extensions granted under PA or HMGP for project completion.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 208.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Maximum Pay Rate Table.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section establishes the process for creating and updating the Maximum Pay Rate Table (Table), and the Table's use to reimburse Affiliated Personnel (Task Force Physicians, Task Force Engineers, and Canine Handlers) and Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency. Section 208.32 defines the “Maximum Pay Rate Table” as “the DHS-issued table that identifies the maximum pay rates for selected System positions that may be used for reimbursement of Affiliated Personnel compensation and Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency.” In that same section, the term “Affiliated <PRTPAGE P="439"/>Personnel” is defined as “individuals not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency and individuals normally affiliated with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency as volunteers.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of this section.</E> (1) The Maximum Pay Rate Table applies to those individuals who are not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency, or whose affiliation with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency is as a volunteer; that is, an individual whom the Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency does not normally compensate in any way, at any rate.</P>
              <P>(2) The Table also applies to Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Method for determining maximum pay rates.</E> (1) DHS uses the United States Office of Personnel Management's salary rates, computed under 5 U.S.C. 5504, as the basis for the maximum pay rate schedule. DHS considers System members' experience and sets maximum pay rates at the maximum grade, middle step for each position, which demonstrates an experience level of five years.</P>
              <P>(2) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes salary and locality pay schedules each calendar year.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Physicians.</E> DHS uses the latest Special Salary Rate Table Number 0290 for Medical Officers (Clinical) Worldwide for physicians. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at <E T="03">http://www.opm.gov/oca/03 tables/SSR/HTML/0290.asp.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Engineers and Canine Handlers.</E> DHS uses the latest General Schedule pay scale for both positions. Both specialties are compared to the General Schedule pay scale to ensure parity with like specialties on a task force (canine handlers are equated with rescue specialists). The rates used in the initial Table can be found at <E T="03">http://www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/html/gs.asp.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Locality Pay.</E> To determine adjustments for locality pay DHS uses the latest locality pay areas (including the “Rest of U.S.” area) established by OPM. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at <E T="03">http://www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/locdef.asp.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review and update.</E> DHS will review and update the Table periodically, at least annually. The comments of Sponsoring and Participating Agencies and their experience with the Table will be considered and evaluated in the course of the reviews.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Initial rates and subsequent revisions.</E> DHS will publish the initial maximum pay rate table in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a notice with request for comments. Subsequent revisions will be made to the pay rate table as OPM changes salary rates as described in this section. When subsequent revisions are made to the maximum pay rate table DHS will publish the new maximum pay rate table in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The rates will be effective for the latest year indicated by OPM. <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/>
              </P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> In some years the latest year may not be the current calendar year. For instance, OPM did not change its pay rates for calendar year 2004, and the 2003 schedules apply.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of the maximum pay rate table</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The Maximum Pay Rate Table sets forth maximum rates for which DHS will reimburse the Sponsoring Agency for compensation paid to Activated Affiliated Personnel and as Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Higher rates.</E> The Sponsoring Agency may choose to pay Affiliated Personnel at a higher rate, but DHS will not reimburse the increment above the maximum rate specified in the Maximum Pay Rate Table. Likewise, the Sponsoring Agency may choose to enter into a Participating Agency agreement with the individual's employer, rather than use the individual as an Affiliated Personnel, in which case the Maximum Pay Rate Table would not apply.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Compensation for Sponsoring Agency employees serving as Affiliated Personnel.</E>  An employee of a Sponsoring Agency serving on a Task Force in a capacity other than his or her normal job, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, a fire department dispatcher affiliated with the Task Force as a canine search specialist, as an Affiliated Personnel, would not necessarily be subject to the Maximum Pay Rate <PRTPAGE P="440"/>Table for reimbursement for salary and benefits for that individual. However, Sponsoring Agencies may use the rates in the Maximum Pay Rate Table as a guide for establishing compensation levels for such individuals.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Backfill expenses for Affiliated Personnel under § 208.39(g).</E>  (i) The only way that DHS can reimburse for Backfill costs incurred for Affiliated Personnel is through Participating Agencies. If reimbursement for Backfill expenses is needed for Affiliated Personnel, DHS encourages them to urge their employers or professional association to seek Participating Agency status.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Private, for-profit organizations.</E>  Participating Agency status is available to private, for-profit organizations, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, HMOs or medical or engineering professional associations, under the revised definition of “Participating Agency” set forth in this Interim rule. (See Definitions, § 208.2, <E T="03">Participating Agency.</E> and § 208.32, <E T="03">Maximum Pay Rate Tabl.e</E>). When a for-profit Participating Agency must backfill an Activated System Member's position we will compensate that Participating Agency up to the maximum rate provided in the Table.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Compensation costs.</E>  DHS will reimburse for-profit organizations, for purposes of reimbursement and Backfill, for the System Member's actual compensation or the actual compensation of the individual who Backfills a position (which includes salary and benefits, as described in §§ 208.39 and 208.40), but will not reimburse for billable or other rates that might be charged for services rendered to commercial clients or patients.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preparedness Cooperative Agreement process.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E>  To obtain DHS funding for an award or amendment of a Preparedness Cooperative Agreement, the Sponsoring Agency must submit an application. Standard form SF-424 “Application for Federal Assistance” generally will be used. However, the application must be in a form that the Assistance Officer specifies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Award.</E>  DHS will award a Preparedness Cooperative Agreement to each Sponsoring Agency to provide Federal funding to develop and maintain System resource capabilities and operational readiness. For the purposes of the Preparedness Cooperative Agreement, the Sponsoring Agency will be considered the “recipient.”</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Procedure.</E>  Absent special circumstances, DHS will fund and amend Preparedness Cooperative Agreements on an annual basis. Before amendment, the Assistance Officer will issue a call for Cooperative Agreement amendment applications. The Assistance Officer will specify required application forms and supporting documentation to be submitted with the application.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Period of performance.</E>  Absent special circumstances, the period of performance for Preparedness Cooperative Agreements will be 1 year from the date of award. The Assistance Officer may allow for an alternate period of performance with the approval of the Assistant Administrator.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Assistance Officer.</E>  The Assistance Officer is the only individual authorized to award or modify a Preparedness Cooperative Agreement.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Award amounts.</E>  The Assistant Administrator will determine award amounts on an annual basis. A Task Force is eligible for an annual award only if the Program Manager receives and approves the Task Force's current-year Daily Cost Estimate.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">DHS priorities.</E>  The Assistant Administrator will establish overall priorities for the use of Preparedness Cooperative Agreement funds taking into consideration the results of readiness evaluations and actual Activations, overall priorities of DHS, and other factors, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Cost sharing.</E>  The Assistant Administrator may subject Preparedness Cooperative Agreement awards to cost sharing provisions. In the call for Preparedness Cooperative Agreement <PRTPAGE P="441"/>amendment applications, the Assistance Officer must inform Sponsoring Agencies about any cost sharing obligations.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Sponsoring Agency priorities.</E>  The Sponsoring Agency should indicate its spending priorities in the application. The Program Manager will review these priorities and will make recommendations to the Assistance Officer for negotiating the final agreement.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Responsibility to maintain integrity of the equipment cache.</E>  The Sponsoring Agency is responsible to maintain the integrity of the equipment cache, including but not limited to, maintenance of the cache, replacement of equipment or supplies expended in training, activations, or local use of the cache, and timely availability of the cache for Task Force Activations.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal.</E> We will notify States about the availability of funds, and will allocate available funding to States that received major disaster declarations during the period covered by the supplemental authority. Our Regional Administrators will verify project eligibility, provide technical assistance to States upon request, make grant awards, and oversee program implementation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">State.</E> The State will be the Grantee to which we award funds and will be accountable for the use of those funds. The State will determine priorities for funding within the State. This determination must be made in conformance with the HMGP project identification and selection criteria (44 CFR 206.435). The State also will provide technical assistance and oversight to applicants for project development and to subgrantees for project implementation. The State will report program progress and results to us. The States also will recover and return to us any funds made available from other sources for the same purposes. When Native American tribes apply directly to us, they will be the grantee and carry out “state” roles.</P>

The subgrantee implements all approved projects, generally takes title to all property, and agrees to dedicate and maintain the property in perpetuity for uses compatible with open-space, recreational, or wetlands management practices. The subgrantee will receive, review and make final decisions about any appraisal disputes that are brought by participating homeowners. The subgrantee is accountable to the State, as well as to us, for the use of funds.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Participating homeowners.</E> The participating homeowners will notify the community of their interest to participate; provide necessary information to the community coordinator about property ownership, disaster damage, and other disaster benefits received or available; review the offer made from the community; and accept it or request a review appraisal.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Timeframes.</E> We will establish deadlines for States to submit applications, and States will set local application deadlines. States may begin forwarding applications to us immediately upon Notice of Availability of Funds and must forward all applications not later than the date set by the Regional Administrator. States must provide to us the information described below in paragraph (c) of this section for each property proposed for acquisition or elevation in support of the supplemental allocation requested and within the timeframe that we establish. We will verify project eligibility estimates provided by States in order to assure that all projects meet the criteria for the supplemental grant awards. We will perform an independent verification of this information for not less than 50 percent of the properties submitted.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Format.</E> The State will forward its application to the Regional Administrator.

Applicants will estimate the value of properties using the best available information, such as inspections, public records and market values of similar properties in similar neighborhoods to arrive at a pre-event fair market value that reflects what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller had the disaster not occurred. If tax assessment data are used as the basis, the applicant should add the relevant adjustment percentage for that jurisdiction to adjust the tax assessment to the current fair market value. These adjustment data should be obtained from the jurisdiction's tax assessor's office. For any <PRTPAGE P="454"/>jurisdictions where the adjustment factor is over 25 percent, applicants should include a justification for the high adjustment factor. Applicants should not include any other project costs in the property values. These costs will be reflected elsewhere;</P>

            <P>Subgrantees must enter into an agreement with the State, with the written concurrence of the Regional Administrator, that provides the following assurances:</P>
            <P>(a) The subgrantee will administer the grant and implement the project in accordance with program requirements, 44 CFR part 13, the grant agreement, and with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) The State and subgrantee will administer the grant in an equitable and impartial manner, without discrimination on the grounds or race, color, religion nationality, sex, age, or economic status in compliance with section 308 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5151) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In implementing the grant, the State and the subgrantee will ensure that no discrimination is practiced.</P>

            <P>(c) The State and subgrantee will ensure that projects involving alterations to existing structures comply with all applicable State and local codes.<PRTPAGE P="455"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) The State and subgrantee will ensure that projects comply with applicable State and local floodplain management requirements. Structures will be elevated to the Base Flood Elevation.</P>
            <P>(e) Property owners participating in acquisition projects may receive assistance up to the pre-event fair market value of their real property, except as limited by the eligibility criteria.</P>
            <P>(f) The subgrantee will establish a process, which we must approve, whereby property owners participating in acquisition projects may request a review of the appraisal for their property, or request a second appraisal.</P>
            <P>(g) The State will reduce buyout assistance by any duplication of benefits from other sources. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, payments made to the homeowner for repair assistance; insurance settlements; legal settlements; Small Business Administration loans; and any other payments made by any source to address the property loss unless the property owner can provide receipts showing that the benefits were used for their intended purpose to make repairs to the property.</P>
            <P>(h) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage benefits under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) may be used to match elevation or acquisition and relocation projects. Increased Cost of Compliance claims can only be used for NFIP-approved costs; these can then be applied to the project grant match. This coverage does not pay for property acquisition, but can pay demolition or structure relocation.</P>
            <P>(i) The following restrictive covenants must be conveyed in the deed to any property acquired, accepted, or from which structures are removed (“the property”):</P>
            <P>(1) The property must be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for uses compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management practices; and</P>
            <P>(2) No new structure(s) will be built on the property except as indicated in this paragraph:</P>
            <P>(A) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;</P>
            <P>(B) A public rest room; or</P>
            <P>(C) A structure that is compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management usage and proper floodplain management policies and practices, which the Administrator of FEMA approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.</P>
            <P>(D) In general, allowable open space, recreational, and wetland management uses include parks for outdoor recreational activities, nature reserves, cultivation, grazing, camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation), temporary storage in the open of wheeled vehicles that are easily movable (except mobile homes), unimproved, permeable parking lots and buffer zones. Allowable uses generally do not include walled buildings, flood reduction levees, highways or other uses that obstruct the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain.</P>
            <P>(3) After completing the acquisition project, no application for future disaster assistance will be made for any purpose with respect to the property to any Federal entity or source, and no Federal entity or source will provide such assistance, even for the allowable uses of the property described above.</P>
            <P>(4) Any structures built on the property according to paragraph (i)(2) of this section, must be: Located to minimize the potential for flood damage; floodproofed; or elevated to the Base Flood Elevation plus one foot of freeboard.</P>
            <P>(5) The subgrantee or other public property owner will seek the approval of the State grantee agency and our Regional Administrator before conveying any interest in the property to any other party. The subgrantee or other public entity or qualified private nonprofit organization must retain all development rights to the property. Our Regional Administrator will only approve the transfer of properties that meet the criteria identified in this paragraph.</P>

            <P>(6) In order to carry out tasks associated with monitoring, we, the subgrantee, or the State have the right to enter the parcel, with notice to the parcel owner, to ensure compliance with land use restrictions. Subgrantees may identify the open space nature of <PRTPAGE P="456"/>the property on local tax maps to assist with monitoring. Whether the subgrantee obtains full title or a conservation easement on the parcel, the State must work with subgrantees to ensure that the parcel owner maintains the property in accordance with land use restrictions. Specifically, the State may:</P>
            <P>(i) Monitor and inspect the parcel every two years and certify that the owner continues to use the inspected parcel for open space or agricultural purposes; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Take measures to bring a non-compliant parcel back into compliance within 60 days of notice.</P>
            <P>(7) Only as a last resort, we reserve the right to require the subgrantee to bring the property back into compliance and transfer the title and easement to a qualified third party for future maintenance.</P>
            <P>(8) Every 2 years on October 1st, the subgrantee will report to the State, certifying that the property continues to be maintained consistent with the provisions of the agreement. The State will report the certification to us.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 295.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Overview of the claims process.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The CGFAA is intended to provide persons who suffered losses from the Cerro Grande Fire with a simple, expedited process to seek redress from the <PRTPAGE P="459"/>United States. This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. In order to obtain benefits under this legislation, a person must submit all Cerro Grande Fire related claims against the United States to FEMA. A person who elects to proceed under the CGFAA is barred from bringing a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or filing a civil action against the United States for damages resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire. Judicial review of our decisions under the CGFAA is available.</P>
              <P>(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with OCGFC. OCGFC will provide the Claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and the claim number.</P>
              <P>(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the Claimant to review the claim. The Claims Reviewer will help the Claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the Claimant of his or her responsibility for establishing all elements of the Loss and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Cerro Grande Fire caused the Loss. After the Claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the Claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official.</P>
              <P>(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the Claimant. The Claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's Determination. If the Claimant is satisfied with the decision payment will be made after the Claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the Claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's Determination an Administrative Appeal may be filed with the Director of OCGFC. If the Claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Partial payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>OCGFC, on its own initiative, or in response to a request by a Claimant, may make one or more partial payments on the claim. A partial payment can be made if OCGFC has a reasonable basis to estimate the Claimant's damages. Acceptance of a partial payment in no way affects a Claimant's ability to pursue an Administrative Appeal of the Authorized Official's Determination or to pursue other rights afforded by the CGFAA. Partial payment decisions cannot be appealed.</P>

              <P>Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, the Director of OCGFC may extend an offer to settle or compromise a claim or any portion of a claim, which if accepted by the Claimant will be binding on the Claimant and on the United States, except that the United States may recover funds improperly paid to a Claimant due to fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the Claimant or the Claimant's representative, a material mistake on our part or the Claimant's failure to cooperate in an audit as required by § 295.35.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Bringing a claim under the CGFAA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any Injured Person may bring a claim under the CGFAA by filing a Notice of Loss. A claim submitted on any form other than a Notice of Loss will not be accepted. The Claimant must provide a brief description of each Loss on the Notice of Loss.</P>

              <P>(b) A single Notice of Loss may be submitted on behalf of a Household containing Injured Persons provided <PRTPAGE P="460"/>that all Injured Persons on whose behalf the claim is presented are identified.</P>
              <P>(c) The Notice of Loss must be signed by each Claimant, if the Claimant is an individual or by a duly authorized legal representative of each Claimant, if the Claimant is an entity or an individual who lacks the legal capacity to sign the Notice of Loss. If one is signing a Notice of Loss as the legal representative of a Claimant, the signer must disclose his or her relationship to the Claimant. FEMA may require a legal representative to submit evidence of authority.</P>

              <P>(d) Notice of Loss forms are available from OCGFC by request. They may be obtained through the mail, in person at the OCGFC office or by telephone request. The Notice of Loss form can also be downloaded from the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.fema.gov/cerrogrande.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Notices of Loss may be filed with OCGFC by mail to P.O. Box 1480, Los Alamos, NM 87544-1480. OCGFC is unable to accept Notices of Loss submitted by facsimile or e-mail.</P>
              <P>(f) A Notice of Loss that is completely filled out and properly signed is deemed to be filed on the date it is received by OCGFC.</P>

              <P>(a) By filing a Notice of Loss, an Injured Person waives the right to seek redress for Cerro Grande Fire related claims against the United States through the Federal Tort Claims Act or by filing a civil action authorized by any other provision of law.</P>
              <P>(b) An Injured Person who files a Federal Tort Claims Act claim or who initiates a civil action against the United States or any officer, employee or agent of the United States relating to the Cerro Grande Fire on or after August 28, 2000 is not eligible under the CGFAA to file a Notice of Loss.</P>
              <P>(c) An Injured Person who filed before August 28, 2000 a Federal Tort Claims Act claim or a civil action against the United States for injuries, losses or damages relating to the Cerro Grande Fire may file a Notice of Loss provided that the Federal Tort Claims Act claim is withdrawn or the Injured Person is dismissed as a party to the civil action with prejudice not later than October 27, 2000. The withdrawal of a Federal Tort Claims Act claim must be in the form of a signed, written statement on a form provided by OCGFC that is filed with OCGFC not later than October 27, 2000. OCGFC will promptly forward the original notice of withdrawal to the applicable federal agency and retain a copy in the Claimant's file.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Subrogation.</SUBJECT>

              <P>An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, who has compensated an Injured Person for Cerro Grande Fire related losses, may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss under the CGFAA for the subrogated claim. An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Party who received payment from the insurer or third party filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss may not be filed until the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Cerro Grande Fire related losses under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee and the Injured Person. By filing a Subrogation Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the insurer or third party elects the CGFAA as its exclusive remedy against the United States for all subrogated claims arising <PRTPAGE P="461"/>out of the Cerro Grande Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a Subrogation Notice of Loss form furnished by OCGFC. FEMA will evaluate subrogation claims on their merits. FEMA may reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for reasonable payments made to an Injured Party on or before October 25, 2000, which exceeded or were not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation. FEMA will not reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for payments made to an Injured Party after October 25, 2000 that exceeded or are not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 295.20</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Prerequisite to compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In order to receive compensation under the CGFAA a Claimant must be an Injured Person who suffered a Loss as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire and sustained damages.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 295.21</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Allowable compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Allowable compensation.</E> The CGFAA provides for the payment of compensatory damages. Compensatory damages are “real, substantial and just money damages established by the Claimant in compensation for actual or real injury or loss.” In general, an Injured Person will be compensated for Losses to the same extent that the plaintiff in a successful tort action brought against a private party under the laws of the State of New Mexico would be compensated. In addition the CGFAA permits FEMA to compensate Injured Parties for certain categories of “loss of property,” “business loss,” and “financial loss,” which are enumerated in the CGFAA. Damages must be reasonable in amount. Claimants must take reasonable steps to mitigate (reduce) their damages, if possible, as required by New Mexico tort law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> Except as otherwise provided in the CGFAA, a Claimant will not receive compensation for any injury or damage that is not compensable under the Federal Tort Claims Act and New Mexico law. Punitive damages, statutory damages under § 30-32-4 of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated (1978), interest on claims, attorney's fees and agents' fees incurred in prosecuting a claim under the CGFAA or an insurance policy, adjusting costs incurred by an insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, and taxes that may be owed by a Claimant as a consequence of receiving an award are not recoverable from FEMA. The cost to a Claimant of prosecuting a claim under the CGFAA does not constitute compensatory damages and is not recoverable from FEMA, except as provided in § 295.31(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Damages arising in the future.</E> In the event that a lump sum payment is awarded to a Claimant for future damages the amount of the payment will be Discounted to Present Value.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Destruction of home</E>—(1) <E T="03">Home and contents.</E> Compensatory damages for the Destruction of a Home may include the reasonable cost of reconstructing a home comparable in design, construction materials, size and improvements to the home that was lost taking into account post-fire construction costs in the community in which the home existed before the fire and current building codes and standards. Compensatory damages may also include the cost of removing debris and burned trees, stabilizing the land, replacing household contents, and compensation for any decrease in the value of land on which the structure sat pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. (2) <E T="03">Trees and landscaping.</E> Compensation for the Replacement Cost of destroyed trees and landscaping will be limited to 25% of the pre-fire value of the structure and lot.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mitigation.</E> If requested by a Claimant, FEMA may compensate a Claimant for the reasonable cost of mitigation measures that will reduce the property's vulnerability to the future risk of wildfire, flood or other natural hazards related to the Cerro <PRTPAGE P="462"/>Grande Fire. Mitigation compensation made available under this section may not exceed fifteen percent of payments from all sources (i.e., CGFAA, insurance proceeds, FEMA assistance under the Stafford Act) for damage to the structure and lot. The Claimant must obtain all government permits, approvals and clearances required by applicable law, ordinance or regulation before constructing the mitigation measures. The mitigation measures must be reviewed by FEMA under applicable environmental and historic preservation laws. Claimants must construct the mitigation measures for which they have received compensation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reduction in the value of real property.</E> Compensatory damages may be awarded for reduction in the value of real property that a Claimant owned before the fire if:</P>
              <P>(1) The Claimant sells the real property in a good faith arm's length transaction that is closed no later than August 28, 2002 and realizes a loss in the pre-fire value; or</P>
              <P>(2) The Claimant can establish that the value of the real property was permanently diminished as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Destruction of unique items of personal property.</E> Compensatory damages may be awarded for unique items of personal property that were destroyed as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire. If the item can be replaced in the current market, the cost to replace the item will be awarded. If the item cannot be replaced in the current market, its fair market value on the date it was destroyed will be awarded.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Disaster recovery loans.</E> FEMA will reimburse Claimants awarded compensation under the CGFAA for interest paid on Small Business Administration disaster loans and similar loans obtained after May 4, 2000. Interest will be reimbursed for the period beginning on the date that the loan was taken out and ending on the date when the Claimant receives a compensation award (other than a partial payment). Claimants are required to use the proceeds of their compensation awards to repay Small Business Administration disaster loans. FEMA will cooperate with the Small Business Administration to formulate procedures for assuring that Claimants repay Small Business Administration disaster loans contemporaneously with the receipt of CGFAA compensation awards.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Mitigation.</E> FEMA may compensate Claimants for the cost of reasonable and cost-effective efforts incurred on or before August 28, 2003 to mitigate the heightened risks of wildfire, flood or other natural disaster resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire that are consistent with a OCGFC-approved Mitigation Compensation Plan. No more than 15% of the total amount appropriated by Congress for the payment of Cerro Grande fire related claims may be allocated for mitigation compensation under this subsection. Claimants seeking compensation under this provision must file a Notice of Loss under § 295.10 or amend a Notice of Loss previously filed under § 295.33 or § 295.34. The Notice of Loss or amendment must specify that compensation for mitigation is sought. The Notice of Loss must be filed or a proposed amendment under § 295.33 or § 295.34 submitted no later than August 28, 2002. A separate request for mitigation assistance must be filed with OCGFC no later than August 28, 2003. Claimants must construct the mitigation measures for which they have received compensation.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Subsistence</E>—(1) <E T="03">Allowable damages.</E> FEMA may reimburse an Indian tribe, a Tribal Member or a Household Including Tribal Members for the reasonable cost of replacing Subsistence Resources customarily and traditionally used by the Claimant on or before May 4, 2000, but no longer available to the Claimant as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire. For each category of Subsistence Resources, the Claimant must elect to receive compensatory damages either for the increased cost of obtaining Subsistence Resources from lands not damaged by the Cerro Grande Fire or for the cost of procuring substitute resources in the cash economy. Long-term damage awards will be made in the form of lump sum cash payments to eligible Claimants.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Proof of subsistence use.</E> FEMA may consider evidence submitted by Claimants, Indian Tribes and other knowledgeable sources in determining <PRTPAGE P="463"/>the nature and extent of a Claimant's subsistence uses.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Duration of damages.</E> Compensatory damages for subsistence losses will be paid for the period between May 4, 2000 and the date when Subsistence Resources can reasonably be expected to return to the level of availability that existed before the Cerro Grande Fire. FEMA may rely upon the advice of experts in making this determination.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Flood insurance.</E> A Claimant that owned or leased real property in the counties of Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval or Santa Fe at the time of the Cerro Grande Fire who was not required by law to maintain flood insurance before the fire and who did not maintain flood insurance before the fire may be reimbursed by FEMA for reasonable flood insurance premiums incurred during the period beginning May 12, 2000 and ending May 12, 2002 on the owned or leased real property. Alternatively, FEMA may provide flood insurance to such Claimants directly through a group or blanket policy.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Out of pocket expenses for treatment of mental health conditions.</E> FEMA may reimburse an individual Claimant for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred for treatment of a mental health condition rendered by a licensed mental health professional, which condition resulted from the Cerro Grande Fire and which could not be effectively addressed through no-cost crisis counseling services available in the community. FEMA will not reimburse for treatment rendered after December 31, 2001.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Donations.</E> FEMA will compensate individual or business Claimants in the counties of Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Santa Fe (including those located on pueblos and Indian reservations) for the cost of merchandise, use of equipment or other non-personal services, directly or indirectly donated to survivors of the Cerro Grande Fire not later than June 19, 2000. Donations will be valued at cost. FEMA will also compensate businesses located in the counties of Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Santa Fe (including those located on pueblos and Indian reservations) for discounts offered to fire survivors on goods and services not later than June 19, 2000 provided that actual revenues earned by the business during the period May 1-June 30, 2000 did not exceed reasonable projections for the period and the shortfall between actual revenues and reasonable projections resulted from the Cerro Grande Fire. Compensation will be the difference between the Claimant's established post-fire price for the good or service actually charged to the general public and the post-fire discounted price charged to fire survivors.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Duplication of benefits.</E> The CGFAA allows FEMA to compensate Injured Parties only if their damages have not been paid or will not be paid by insurance or a third party.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> Claimants who carry insurance will be required to disclose the name of the insurer(s) and the nature of the insurance and provide OCGFC with such insurance documentation as OCGFC reasonably requests.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Coordination with our Public Assistance Program.</E> Injured Parties eligible for disaster assistance under our Public Assistance Program are expected to apply for all available assistance. Compensation will not be awarded under the CGFAA for:</P>
              <P>(i) Emergency costs that are eligible for reimbursement under the Public Assistance Program; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Losses that are eligible for repair, restoration or replacement under the Public Assistance Program; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Costs or charges determined excessive under the Public Assistance Program.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Benefits provided by non-governmental organizations and individuals.</E> Unless otherwise provided by these regulations, disaster relief payments made to a Claimant by a non-governmental organization or an individual, other than wages paid by the Claimant's employer or insurance payments, will be disregarded in evaluating claims and need not be disclosed to OCGFC by Claimants.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Benefits provided by our Individual Assistance program.</E> Compensation under the CGFAA will not be awarded <PRTPAGE P="464"/>for losses or costs that have been reimbursed under the Individual and Family Grant Program or any other FEMA Individual Assistance Program.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Worker's compensation claims.</E> Individuals who have suffered injuries that are compensable under State or Federal worker's compensation laws must apply for all benefits available under such laws.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Burden of proof.</E> The burden of proving Losses and damages rests with the Claimant. A Claimant may submit for the Administrative Record a statement explaining why the Claimant believes that the Losses and damages are compensable and any documentary evidence supporting the claim. Claimants will provide documentation, which is reasonably available, to corroborate the nature, extent and value of their losses and/or to execute affidavits in a form established by OCGFC. FEMA may compensate a Claimant for a Loss in the absence of supporting documentation, in its discretion, on the strength of an affidavit or Proof of Loss executed by the Claimant, if documentary evidence substantiating the loss is not reasonably available. FEMA may request that a business Claimant execute an affidavit, which states that the Claimant will provide documentary evidence, including but not limited to income tax returns, if requested by our DHS Office of the Inspector General or the Government Accountability Office during an audit of the claim.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proof of Loss.</E> All Claimants are required to attest to the nature and extent of each Loss for which compensation is sought in the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss, which will be in a form specified by OCGFC, must be signed by the Claimant or the Claimant's legal representative if the Claimant is a not an individual or is an individual who lacks the legal capacity to execute the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss must be signed under penalty of perjury and subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C.1001, which establishes penalties for false statements. Non-subrogation Claimants who filed a Notice of Loss before January 1, 2001 should submit a signed Proof of Loss to OCGFC not later than June 19, 2001. Non-subrogation Claimants who file a Notice of Loss on or after January 1, 2001 should submit a signed Proof of Loss to OCGFC not later than 150 days after the date when the Notice of Loss was submitted. These deadlines may be extended at the discretion of the Director of OCGFC for good cause. If a non-subrogation Claimant fails to submit a signed Proof of Loss within the timeframes set forth in this section and does not obtain an extension from the Director of OCGFC, OCGFC may administratively close the claim and require the Claimant to repay any partial payments made on the claim. Subrogation Claimants will submit the Proof of Loss contemporaneously with filing the Notice of Loss.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Release and Certification Form.</E> All Claimants who receive compensation under the CGFAA are required to sign a Release and Certification Form. The Release and Certification Form must be executed by the Claimant or the Claimant's legal representative if the Claimant is an entity or lacks the legal capacity to execute the Release and Certification Form. The Release and Certification Form must be received by OCGFC within 120 days of the date when the Authorized Official's Determination is rendered under § 295.32, or if subsequent proceedings occur under Subpart E of these regulations, not later than 60 days after the date when further review of the decision (if available) is precluded.

              <SUBJECT>Arbitration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initiating arbitration.</E> A Claimant who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Administrative Appeal may initiate binding arbitration by submitting a written request for arbitration to the Arbitration Administrator for Cerro Grande Claims, Alternate Dispute Resolution Office, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., room 214, Washington, DC 20472 on a form provided by OCGFC. The written request for arbitration must be received not later than 60 days after the date that appears on the Administrative Appeal decision.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Permissible claims.</E> A Claimant may not arbitrate an issue unless it was raised and decided in the Administrative Appeal. Arbitration will be conducted on the evidence in the Administrative Record. Evidence not previously entered into the Administrative Record will not be considered.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Settlement and mediation alternatives.</E> At any time after a request for arbitration is filed and before the time a decision is rendered, either party may request in writing that the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office stay further proceedings in the arbitration to facilitate settlement discussions. A mediator may be appointed (if requested by the parties) to facilitate settlement discussions. If both parties concur in the request, the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will stay the arbitration and appoint a mediator at our expense. The stay may be terminated and the arbitration resumed upon written request of either party to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. If the dispute is settled, the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will issue an order terminating the arbitration and provide the Claimant with a Release and Certification Form.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Selection of arbitrator.</E> Arbitrators will be selected from a list of qualified arbitrators who have agreed to serve provided by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. If the amount in dispute is $300,000 or less, the arbitration will be decided by one arbitrator selected by the Claimant from the list. If the amount in dispute exceeds $300,000, a panel of three arbitrators selected at random by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will decide the arbitration.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Conduct of arbitration.</E> The arbitration will be conducted in a manner determined by the arbitrator consistent with guidelines established by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will provide these guidelines upon request.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> The arbitrator may convene a hearing at a location designated by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. Whenever possible hearings will be held in Los Alamos, New Mexico unless the parties jointly agree to a different location.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Decision.</E> After reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator(s) will render a decision in writing to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will transmit the decision to the Claimant and the Director of OCGFC. If a panel <PRTPAGE P="468"/>of three arbitrators conducts the arbitration, at least two of the three arbitrators must sign the decision. The decision will be rendered no later than 10 Days after a hearing is concluded or 60 Days after the arbitration is initiated, whichever is earlier. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office may extend the time for a decision. The decision will establish the compensation due to the Claimant, if any, and the reasons therefore.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Action on arbitration decision.</E> The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will forward the arbitration decision and a Release and Certification Form to the Claimant. A Claimant who has received or who has been awarded any compensation under the CGFAA must sign and return the Release and Certification Form, regardless of whether any additional compensation is awarded by the arbitration. Additional compensation awarded in the arbitration will be paid to the Claimant after the signed Release and Certification Form is received.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Final decision.</E> The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on all parties and will not be subject to any administrative or judicial review. The arbitrator may correct clerical, typographical or computational errors as requested by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Administration of arbitration.</E> The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will serve as arbitration administrator and will conclusively resolve any procedural disputes arising in the course of the arbitration. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will pay the fees of the arbitrator and reimburse the arbitrator for arbitration related expenses unless the parties jointly agree otherwise.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Judicial review.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As an alternative to arbitration, a Claimant dissatisfied with the outcome of an Administrative Appeal may seek judicial review of the decision by bringing a civil lawsuit against FEMA in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. This lawsuit must be brought within 60 Days of the date that appears on the Administrative Appeal decision. The court may only consider evidence in the Administrative Record. The court will uphold our decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. If the judge has awarded damages over and above those previously paid, FEMA will cause the damages to be paid to the Claimant upon receipt of the Release and Certification Form or as otherwise specified by order of the court. Claimants who have received any compensation under the CGFAA must return a Release and Certification Form as provided in § 295.30(c), regardless of whether the court awards additional compensation.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Annual submission.</E> The State's annual request for participation in the contributions program authorized by section 205 of the Act. As specified in CPG 1-3, it includes staffing patterns (including job description changes), budget requirements, and any amendments to the State administrative plan, a request for funds covering the State and its subgrantees and program statements of work for the grantee and subgrantees under the Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval.</E> All approvals by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as grantor agency required under the regulations in this part mean prior approval in writing signed by an authorized FEMA official.

References to CPG 1-3 include provisions of any other volumes of the CPG series specifically referenced in CPG 1-3. Copies of the Civil Preparedness Guides and the Civil Preparedness Circulars may be ordered by FEMA Regional Offices using FEMA Form 60-8 transmitted to FEMA, P.O. Box 8181, Washington, DC, 20024. One or more copies of CPG 1-3 have been distributed to each State and to each local government participating in the program under the regulations in this part.

Thus, emergency management includes “civil defense” for and operations in either attack-related or disaster-related emergencies. Section 207 allows Federal Civil Defense Act funds to be used for disaster preparedness and response if such use “is consistent with, contributes to, and does not detract from attack-related civil defense preparedness.” Also 44 CFR part 312, Use of Civil Defense Personnel, Materials, and Facilities for Natural Disaster Purposes, provides terms and conditions for such use.</P>

Refusal or failure to comply with such requirements and conditions may result in the grantor agency cancelling, terminating, or suspending the grant, in whole or in part, and refraining from extending any further assistance to the grantee or subgrantee until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Disapproval or conditional approval.</E> If a State's administrative plan or annual submission is disapproved, the Regional Administrator will advise the State in writing, including the reasons for such disapproval and the revisions required for approval. The State shall have 30 days from date of such notification in which to submit its revisions. In the event more time is required in which to place the revisions into effect, the Regional Administrator may conditionally approve the State administrative plan or annual submission subject to the specified conditions to be met within a specified time, as agreed by the State and FEMA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> (1) Appeal from a Regional Administrator's disapproval of a <PRTPAGE P="478"/>State administrative plan or an annual submission or other final action as unjustified under the criteria in CPG 1-3 may be made by letter to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, signed by an authorized State official and submitted through the Regional Administrator. Such appeal letter shall be mailed or otherwise transmitted so as to reach the Regional Administrator within 30 days after receipt of the notification of disapproval. Failure to file its appeal on time may result in withdrawal of the State's allocation and the proposed funding being reallocated by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(2) A local jurisdiction that regards the final action on its subgrant made by a State as unjustified under the criteria in CPG 1-3 may submit an appeal through the State to the Regional Administrator. Upon receipt of such an appeal, the RegionalAdministrator shall forward the letter, together with all available pertinent documentation from the Regional Administrator's files and any additional documentation submitted by the local jurisdiction in support of its appeal, to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, for review and determination. The appeal shall contain all of the exceptions being taken by the State or local jurisdiction, and no exceptions will be determined piecemeal.</P>
            <P>(3) No portion of the appellant State's allocation shall be reallocated by FEMA, and no portion of a local jurisdiction's allocation shall be reallocated by the State, pending determination of its appeal by the Administrator. The State and local jurisdiction (if applicable) will be notified in writing of the Administrator's decision, including a statement of the reasons therefor.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> Section 208 of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4728) authorizes Federal agencies to require, as a condition of participation in Federal assistance programs, systems of a personnel administration consistent with personnel standards prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has promulgated Standards for a System of Personnel Administration (5 CFR part 900) which prescribe intergovernmental personnel standards on a merit basis as a condition of eligibility in the administration of grant programs. OPM has approved FEMA adoption of these standards by the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard.</E> Participation by each grantee and each subgrantee under the program covered in this part is subject to compliance with the following conditions regarding merit personnel systems:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <P>Methods of personnel administration will be established and maintained in public agencies administering or supervising the administration of the civil defense program in conformity with the Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration 5 CFR part 900, which incorporate the Intergovernmental Personnel Act Merit Principles (Pub. L. 91-648, section 2, 84 Stat. 1909) prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management pursuant to section 208 of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 as amended.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 302.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Allocations and reallocations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Administrator shall allocate the entire amount of funds available for the purposes of this program from the appropriation for each fiscal year. The allocation made to each State represents the total amount of funds available to pay the Federal share of necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative expenses of the State and its participating subdivisions during the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(b) The first calculation for developing the allocation for each State will be a formula distribution in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act, made by applying the following percentages to the total sum of Emergency Management Assistance in the President's budget request to Congress:</P>

            <P>(1) Fifty (50) percent will be allocated on the basis of the prior-year State allocations, in fulfilment of the statutory requirement to give due regard to “the relative state of development of <PRTPAGE P="479"/>civil defense readiness of the State” (State and local levels).</P>
            <P>(2) Thirty-three (33) percent will be allocated on the basis of the ratio of the State's population to the national population (50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), in fulfilment of the statutory requirements to give due regard to “population” and to “the criticality of target and support areas and the areas which may be affected by natural disasters with respect to the development of the total civil defense readiness of the Nation.”</P>
            <P>(3) Fifteen (15) percent will be divided equally among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</P>
            <P>(4) In consonance with the statutory provision allowing the Administrator to prescribe other factors concerning the State allocations, the remaining two (2) percent will be held temporarily in reserve, to be used first to fund the four territories of the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Conditions peculiar to those areas make strict application of the mathematical formula in § 302.5(b) inequitable. Therefore, the Administrator will consider prior-year allocations, percentage of total United States population, and the factors set out in § 302.5(e) (1), (2), (4), and (5) in determining their allocations. The remaining balance of the reserve fund will then be used to restore any State which would receive less by formula share than its formula share for the previous fiscal year, provided that the reserve balance is sufficient to do this for all such States. Any remaining balance after this has been done will constitute a supplemental fund from which the Administrator will consider State requests for additional funding and the needs of any interstate civil defense authorities.</P>
            <P>(c) For initial planning purposes only, each State will then be informed of the figure by the Regional Administrator. The State will base its initial EMA application upon that figure but may request a smaller amount or with appropriate justification a larger amount.</P>
            <P>(d) The amount requested by the State shall not exceed 50 percent of its estimate of necessary and essential State and local personnel and administrative expenses for the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(e) The formula distribution shall be reviewed and evaluated, and adjusted as appropriate, by the Administrator, based on the current situation in each State, the requests of all States, and recommendations by the Regional Administrators. The Administrator will consider the following five factors:</P>
            <P>(1) The ability of the State and its subgrantees to effectively expend such an amount for necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative purposes. Past performance is a factor in this determination.</P>
            <P>(2) Special circumstances existing in the State at the time of allocating which require unusual expenditures for civil defense.</P>
            <P>(3) Conditions peculiar to the State which make strict application of mathematical formula inequitable either to that State or other States.</P>
            <P>(4) The relative cost of civil defense personnel and administrative services in that State; that is, whether such costs are considerably above or below the national average for similar services and expenses.</P>
            <P>(5) Substantial changes in the civil defense readiness of the State not reflected by its recent civil defense expenditures.</P>
            <P>(f) In September of each year, based on applications received and recommendations by the Regional Administrators, the Administrator will make a tentative allocation to the States. This will include adjustments for States that have indicated they will not be using the total of the formula distribution amount. States can then revise their earlier plans and applications to more nearly reflect the level of funding expected to become available.</P>
            <P>(g) A State may provide to the Regional Administrator a preliminary annual submission in an amount not to exceed its tentative allocation.</P>

            <P>(h) By September 30 (or as soon thereafter as feasible), the Administrator will make a formal allocation based on, or subject to, appropriation by Congress and allotment of the funds. This allocation for each State may include any additional amounts from the reserve portion of the EMA funds, and shall be in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="480"/>the regulations in this part and CPG 1-3.</P>
            <P>(i) Upon the appropriation becoming available, and if requested by a State, the Regional Administrator may approve such State's preliminary annual submission (if found to meet all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3) in an appropriate amount which does not exceed the amount of the State's share of the Administrator's formal allocation of the Federal appropriation. An award document obligating Federal funds on the basis of the approved preliminary annual submission may be executed in accordance with the provisions of CPG 1-3.</P>
            <P>(j) Based on and within 60 days after notification of its formal allocation, each State must provide to the Regional Administrator a final annual submission which meets all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3. If no changes are necessary, a State and the Regional Administrator may adopt in writing the State's preliminary annual submission as its final annual submission. If no award document was executed based on a State's preliminary annual submission, such document will be executed on the basis of that State's approved final annual submission.</P>
            <P>(k) With regard to any State whose award document was executed pursuant to a preliminary annual submission covering only part of its formal allocation, upon approval (by the Regional Administrator) of the final annual submission (including a revised statement of work supporting the additional funding request) the Regional Administrator shall execute an amended award document obligating the balance of such State's formal allocation.</P>
            <P>(l) After being advised of its annual formal allocation, if a State fails to submit, within 60 days, an approvable annual submission in the amount of its allocation, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the unused portion to other States in the region in such amounts as in his/her judgment will best assure adequate development of the civil defense capability of the Nation. The exception to this authority is in the event a State, or local jurisdiction, refuses to participate in attack preparedness activities. EMA funds withheld or returned for that reason are to be released to headquarters for reallocation on a national basis. In addition, the Regional Administrator may from time to time reallocate the amounts released by a State from its allocation as no longer being required for utilization in accordance with an approved annual submission and award document.</P>
            <P>(m) Immediate notice to the headquarters EMA Program Manager of State reallocations is required in the form of copies of EMA-approved Annual Submission amendment documents, accompanied by copies of assistance award/amendment documents signed by regional and State authorized officials of both the releasing and recipient States.</P>
            <P>(n) There is no dollar ceiling on the amount of funds that may be reallocated among States in a region. However, at any time that there are funds surplus to the eligible needs of the States within a region, those funds should be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation to other States with unfunded additional requirements.</P>
            <P>(o) On July 1 of each fiscal year, the authority to reallocate EMA funds shall revert to the Administrator. In addition, any excess EMA funds available on that date, or that become available during the remainder of the fiscal year, are to be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation by the Administrator.</P>

Each annual submission (or amendment thereto) which results in a change in scope (e.g., an increase in the amount of funds other than a cost overrun) must be approved during the Federal Fiscal year for which the funds to be charged were appropriated.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Emergencies.</E> In addition to such civil defense use, Federal funds obligated under a grantee's approved annual submission may be used, to the extent and under such terms and conditions as prescribed by the Administrator in CPG 1-3, for providing emergency assistance, including the use of civil defense personnel, organizational equipment, materials, and facilities, in preparation for and response to actual attack-related events or natural disasters (including manmade catastrophies).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Section 207 of the Act allows use of funds under the Act, including those for this program, for natural (including manmade) disaster preparedness and response purposes only to the extent that such use is consistent with, contributes to, and does not detract from attack-related preparedness (reference 44 CFR part 312).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waiver of “single” State agency requirements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Section 205 of the Act requires that plans for civil defense of the United States be administered or supervised by a single State agency (50 U.S.C. App. 2286). Notwithstanding such law, section 204 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4214) provides authority for the Administrator as head of the grantor agency, upon the State's request, to waive the single State agency requirement and to approve other State administrative structure or arrangements, upon adequate showing that the requirement prevents the establishment of the most effective and efficient organizational arrangements within the State government. First, however, the Administrator must have found that the objectives of the Act (50 U.S.C. app. 2251 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) will not be endangered by the use of such other State structure or arrangements. Attachment D of OMB Circular A-102 requires that such requests be given expeditious handling by the grantor agency and that, whenever possible, an affirmative response be made.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A sustained state of mobilization production readiness is necessary to place the United States in a defense posture which will enable the nation to defend itself against aggression in peripheral conflicts or general war involving nuclear attacks on this country. Therefore, the facilities, machine tools, production equipment, and skilled workers necessary to produce the wartime requirements of the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration shall be maintained in a state of readiness which will facilitate their immediate use or conversion in time of emergency, with especial emphasis on measures to maximize the probability of continued post-attack production of those items judged to be vital to survival and victory.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Selection of the mobilization base.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Department of Defense shall select, for its mobilization base, facilities which produce or are capable of producing critically important military items or components (military class A components used entirely in the production, maintenance, or repair of military items) which meet one of the following:<PRTPAGE P="486"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Those items which would be so urgent to the defense of this country that utmost effort must be exerted to produce them even in case of general war involving severe damage to the facilities necessary to produce these items and the components thereof.</P>
            <P>(2) Those items essential to survival and retaliation, maintenance of health, or combat efficiency required to support peripheral war and which meet one or more of the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) Items requiring a long lead-time or long manufacturing cycle.</P>
            <P>(ii) Items currently not in production or which are required in quantities far in excess of peacetime production.</P>
            <P>(iii) Items requiring the conversion of an industry or a number of plants within an industry.</P>
            <P>(iv) Items requiring materials or manufacturing processes essentially different from those in current use.</P>
            <P>(v) Items for which industry does not have production experience.</P>
            <FP>Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is inclusive of the Department of Defense Preferential Planning List of End Items.</FP>
            <P>(b) In selecting facilities for the Department of Defense mobilization base, consideration shall be given to their vulnerability to nuclear attack, with particular attention to the possibility of (1) minimizing vulnerability of facilities producing “urgent” items under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including the need for dispersal, protective construction, and special security measures to safeguard against sabotage of clandestine attack, and (2) reducing concentration of uncommon critical production facilities so that a productive segment of each critical industry would be likely to survive a nuclear attack.</P>
            <P>(c) The Department of Energy and the Maritime Administration, in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall determine the items and facilities which meet the above criteria for their respective programs for maintaining the mobilization base.</P>

            <P>(a) Facilities selected to produce “urgent” items shall be maintained within limits of existing procurement authority and funds available by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration in the following manners to the maximum practical degree:</P>
            <P>(1) Current procurement shall be placed in these facilities to the extent which will maintain them in a state of readiness compatible with the plans of the procuring agency.</P>
            <P>(2) Machine tools and production equipment will be installed in these facilities to the extent found necessary by the procuring agency.</P>
            <P>(3) Develop and maintain plans for alternate production capacity in case disaster destroys current facilities, such capacity to be located to the maximum extent possible away from highly concentrated industrial areas and major military installations.</P>
            <P>(b) Other facilities selected as part of the mobilization base, shall be maintained to the fullest extent possible.</P>
            <P>(1) Procurement agencies shall integrate current procurement with their industrial mobilization plans to the greatest possible extent with the objective of supporting the mobilization base within authorities and funds available.</P>
            <P>(2) Data assembled on essential mobilization suppliers by the industrial mobilization planning of these agencies shall be used in planning current procurement. The policy of using contractors and facilities essential to the mobilization base is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.</P>
            <P>(3) Planned producers that are deemed to be a part of the mobilization base will be invited to participate in appropriate current procurement.</P>
            <P>(4) Upon expiration of current procurement contracts in a facility, the procuring agency shall take such of the following actions as are compatible with its plans for maintaining a state of readiness:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Government-owned facilities and tools.</E> Within the limitations that may be imposed by Congressional appropriations, place government-owned facilities and tools in standby status and establish provisions for their adequate maintenance. This does not preclude <PRTPAGE P="487"/>the use of government-owned production equipment, on a loan basis, to enable the military departments to meet current production schedules, as provided in DMO-VII-4, Amendment 1.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Privately-owned facilities and government-owned tools.</E> (A) Arrange with management of privately-owned facilities, wherever possible, to place government-owned tools and production equipment in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe location.</P>
            <P>(B) Arrange with management, on a voluntary basis, to keep a group of key managers, engineers, and skilled workers familiar with the items planned for mobilization production.</P>
            <P>(C) Determine the gaps which exist in government-owned packages of tools and production equipment needed to produce mobilization requirements in privately-owned plants. Within the limit of fund availability, plan the procurement of such tools and equipment with priority being given to long lead-time tools and equipment or those not used in general manufacturing. These tools and equipment, when procured, should be placed in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe locations.</P>
            <P>(D) Determine which government-owned tools and equipment have become obsolete, or which would not be used in event of mobilization, and plan for their disposal in accordance with the provisions of DMO-VII-4, as amended.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In an immediate postattack period all decisions regarding the use of resources will be directed to the objective of national survival and recovery. In order to achieve this objective, postattack resources will be assigned to activities concerned with the maintenance and saving of lives, immediate military defense and retaliatory operations, economic activities essential to continued survival and recovery.</P>
            <P>(b) This guidance is designed to achieve a degree of national equity in the use of resources and to assign and conserve resources effectively in the immediate postattack period. Until more specific instructions are available, these are the general guidelines within which managerial judgment and common sense must be used to achieve national objectives under widely differing emergency conditions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As stated in The National Plan for Emergency Preparedness, the direction of resources mobilization is a Federal responsibility. However, in the period immediately following an attack, certain geographical areas may be temporarily isolated, and State and local governments will assume responsibility for the use of resources remaining in such areas until effective Federal authority can be restored. State and local governments will not assume responsibility for resources under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency where the Federal agency is able to function.</P>
            <P>(b) As soon as possible after an attack and until specific national direction and guidance on the use of resources is provided, Federal, State, and local officials will determine what resources are available, to what needs they can be applied, how they are to be used, and the extent to which resources are deficient or in excess of survival needs. They will base determinations as to the relative urgency for use of resources primarily upon the importance of specific needs of defense, survival, and recovery.</P>

            <P>The following activities are to be accorded priority over all other claims <PRTPAGE P="489"/>for resources. There is no significance in the order of the listing—all are important. The order in which and the extent to which they are supported locally may vary with local conditions and circumstances. If local conditions necessitate the establishment of an order of priority among these activities, that order shall be based on determinations of relative urgency among the activities listed, the availability of resources for achieving the actions required, and the feasibility and timeliness of the activities in making the most rapid and effective contribution to national survival.</P>
            <P>(a) The immediate defense and retaliatory combat operations of the Armed Forces of the United States and its Allies: This includes support of military personnel and the production and distribution of military and atomic weapons, materials and equipment required to carry out these immediate defense and retaliatory combat operations.</P>
            <P>(b) Maintenance or reestablishment of Government authority and control to restore and preserve order and to assure direction of emergency operations essential for the safety and protection of the people. This includes:</P>
            <P>(1) Police protection and movement direction;</P>
            <P>(2) Fire defense, rescue and debris clearance;</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix 1 to Part 323—List of Essential Survival Items</HD>
            <P>This document contains a list of items considered essential to sustain life at a productive level to assure national survival in an emergency. The list identifies items to which major attention should be given in all phases of preattack planning to insure the availability of basic essentials for a productive economy in the event of a nuclear attack. Supply-requirements studies and assessments for these items will be made to disclose critical deficiencies or other problems that can be anticipated. Revisions will be made as necessary to keep the items as up-to-date as possible.</P>
            <P>The items are arranged by seven major groups:</P>
            <P>(1) Health Supplies and Equipment,</P>
            <P>(2) Food,</P>
            <P>(3) Body Protection and Household Operations,</P>
            <P>(4) Electric Power and Fuels,</P>
            <P>(5) Sanitation and Water Supply,<PRTPAGE P="490"/>
            </P>
            <P>(6) Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment, and</P>
            <P>(7) General Use Items.</P>
            <P>Survival items are defined as “those items without which large segments of the population would die or have their health so seriously impaired as to render them both burdensome and non-productive.” The items have been classified into Group A or Group B, with Group A representing end products consumed or used directly by the population, and Group B consisting of those items essential to the effective production and utilization of the Group A items, which are consumed or used directly by the people.</P>
            <P>There are no Group B items in the categories of Health Supplies and Equipment, Body Production and Household Operations, and Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment. All of these items are considered to be consumed directly and any attempt to separate them in to A and B groupings would be too arbitrary to be meaningful.</P>
            <P>It is important to keep in mind the fact that while the items listed are the basic essentials necessary for maintaining a viable economy during the first six months following an attack, not all of them would create problems that would require government action preattack to insure adequate supplies. The aforementioned supply-requirements studies will be undertaken to identify the problem areas. In developing supply data, all available production capacity, existing inventories, and possible substitutions will be considered. For example, in analyzing clothing items, all available supplies would be considered from sport to dress shirts, from overalls to dress suits. However, new production would be limited to the simplest form of the basic item which can be produced. The final determination as to which of the items are most critical and which may require preattack actions by the Government, as well as the type of actions which must be taken, can be made only after a comprehensive supply-requirements analysis is completed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part establishes policy on the use by private industry of Government-owned industrial plant equipment. This policy is necessary to maintain a highly effective and immediately available reserve of such equipment for the emergency preparedness programs of the U.S. Government.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 327.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This part applies to all Federal departments and agencies having, for purposes of mobilization readiness, Government-owned industrial plant equipment under their jurisdiction or control and having emergency preparedness functions assigned by Executive orders concerning use of that equipment.<PRTPAGE P="494"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) As used herein, <E T="03">industrial plant equipment</E> means those items of equipment, each with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, that fall within specified classes of equipment listed in DOD regulations. Classes of equipment may from time to time be added to or deleted from this list.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 327.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Primary reliance for defense production shall be placed upon private industry.</P>
            <P>(2) When it is determined by an agency that, because of the lack of specific industrial plant equipment, private industry of the United States cannot be relied upon for needed Government production, that agency may provide to private industry such Government-owned industrial plant equipment as is deemed necessary to ensure required production capability. Requirements for such equipment should be reviewed at least annually to ascertain the continuing need, particularly with a view toward private industry furnishing the equipment for long term requirements.</P>
            <P>(3) When it is necessary for Federal agencies to supply Government-owned industrial plant equipment to private industry, these agencies will maintain uniformity and fairness in the arrangements for the use of this equipment by following regulations for the use of such equipment as developed and published by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 809 of Public Law 93-155. The regulations to be developed by the Secretary of Defense shall be in consonance with this order. These regulations will attempt to ensure that no Government contractor is afforded an advantage over his competitors and that Government-owned industrial plant equipment is maintained properly and kept immediately available for the emergency preparedness needs of the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Interagency use of idle equipment.</E> In any instances in which a Government contractor cannot meet Government production schedules because necessary industrial plant equipment is not available from private industry or from the contracting Federal department or agency, idle industrial plant equipment under the control of other Federal agencies may be made available for this purpose through existing authorities on a transfer, loan, or replacement basis by interagency agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Availability of equipment for emergency use.</E> Government-owned industrial plant equipment may be provided by controlling agencies for emergency use by essential Government contractors whose facilities have been damaged or destroyed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Uniform rental rates.</E> All new agreements entered into by any agency of the Federal Government under which private business establishments are provided with Government-owned industrial plant equipment shall be subject to rental rates established by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 809 of Public Law 93-155. The rental rates shall ensure a fair and equitable return to the U.S. Government and be generally competitive with commercial rates for like equipment.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of Government-owned industrial plant equipment for commercial</E> (<E T="03">non-Government</E>) <E T="03">purposes.</E> Subject to adequate controls being established under DOD regulations pursuant to Public Law 93-155, and statutory authority for leasing, Government-owned industrial plant equipment may be authorized for commercial use by contractors performing contracts or subcontracts for the Government agency if it is necessary to keep the equipment in a high state of operational readiness through regular usage to support the emergency preparedness programs of the U.S. Government.</P>

            <P>This part provides policy guidance concerning the use of priorities and allocation authority under title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, for the procurement of common use items in the Federal Supply Classification (FSC).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following guidance is provided pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended; section 201 of Executive Order 10480, and § 322.2 of this chapter (DMO-3).</P>
            <P>(a) Priority ratings under title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, are not authorized for certain FSC Groups, Classes, and Items:</P>
            <P>(1) Which are of the types commonly available in commercial markets for general consumption,</P>
            <P>(2) Which do not require major modification when purchased for military or other ratable government use, and</P>
            <P>(3) Which are in sufficient supply as to cause no hindrance to the accomplishment of military or other national defense objectives.</P>
            <FP>Such Groups, Classes, and Items will be as specified from time to time by the Department of Commerce with the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Procurement in these Groups, Classes, and Items is to be made without priority assistance, including single service procurement that may include defense and defense-supporting needs. In the event procurement difficulties are encountered which threaten timely delivery, application for special assistance may be made for those categories of supply authorized special assistance in existing lists, and must be accompanied by full justification to support the need for such assistance.</FP>
            <P>(b) Priority ratings may be used for the procurement of other authorized FSC Groups, Classes, and Items only in quantities required to meet the needs of approved programs of ratable agencies.

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Success of the national defense program depends upon efficient use of all of our resources, including the labor force and production facilities, which are preserved through utilizing the skills of both management and labor. A primary aim of Federal manpower policy is to encourage full utilization of existing production facilities and workers in preference to creating new plants or moving workers, thus assisting in the maintenance of economic balance and employment stability. When large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing, transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is the policy of the Federal Government to award appropriate contracts to eligible labor surplus area concerns, to place production facilities in labor surplus areas, and to make the best use of our natural, industrial and labor resources in order to achieve the following objectives:</P>
            <P>(1) To preserve management and employee skills necessary to the fulfillment of Government contracts and purchases;</P>
            <P>(2) To maintain productive facilities;</P>
            <P>(3) To improve utilization of the Nation's total economic potential by making use of the labor force resources of each area; and</P>
            <P>(4) To help ensure timely delivery of required goods and services and to promote readiness for mobilization by locating procurement where the needed labor force and facilities are fully available.</P>
            <P>(b) This policy is consonant with the intent of Public Law 95-89 and Public Law 95-507 as implemented by E.O. 12073. In carrying out this policy, Federal departments and agencies shall be guided by E.O. 12073, the policy direction of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and implementing regulations.</P>

            <P>The provisions of this policy apply to all Federal departments and agencies, except as otherwise prohibited by law. In addition to these normal duties;</P>
            <P>(a) The Secretary of Commerce shall:</P>
            <P>(1) In cooperation with State economic development agencies, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of Small Business Administration, assist concerns which have agreed to perform contracts in labor surplus areas in obtaining Government procurement business by providing such concerns with timely information on proposed Government procurements.</P>
            <P>(2) Urge concerns planning new production facilities to consider the advantages of locating in labor surplus areas.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide technical advice and counsel to groups and organizations in labor surplus areas on planning industrial parks, industrial development organizations, expanding tourist business, and available Federal aids.</P>
            <P>(b) The Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall make available to small business concerns in labor surplus areas all of its services, endeavor to ensure opportunity for maximum participation by such concerns in Government procurement, and give consideration to the needs of these concerns in the making of joint small business set-asides with Government procurement agencies.</P>
            <P>(c) OFPP shall coordinate the maintenance by Federal agencies of current information on the manufacturing capabilities of labor surplus area concerns with respect to Government procurement and disseminate such information to Federal departments and agencies.</P>

            <P>(b) Establishes a Graduated Mobilization Response (GMR) system for developing and implementing mobilization actions that are responsive to a wide range of national security threats and ambiguous or specific warning indicators. GMR provides for a coherent decision making process with which to proceed with specific responses to an identified crisis or emergency.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 334.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As established in Executive Order 12656, the policy of the United States is to have sufficient emergency response capabilities at all levels of government to meet essential defense and civilian needs during any national security emergency. Accordingly, each Federal department and agency shall prepare its national security emergency preparedness plans and programs to respond adequately and in a timely manner to all national security emergencies.</P>
            <P>(b) As part of emergency response, the GMR system should be incorporated in each department's and agency's emergency preparedness plans and programs to provide appropriate and effective response options for consideration in reacting to ambiguous and specific warnings.</P>
            <P>(c) Departments and agencies will be provided early warning information developed by the intelligence community and policy statements of the President.</P>
            <P>(d) Emergency resource preparedness planning is essential to ensure that the nation is adequately prepared to respond to potential national emergencies. Such emergency resource preparedness planning requires an exchange of information and planning factors among the various departments and agencies responsible for different resource preparedness actitivities.</P>
            <P>(e) To carry out their emergency planning activities, civilian departments and agencies require the Department of Defense's (DOD) assessment of potential military demands that would be made on the economy in a full range of possible national security emergencies. Similarly, DOD planning should be conducted using planning regimes consistent with the policies and plans of the civilian resource departments and agencies.</P>
            <P>(f) Under section 104(c) of Executive Order 12656, FEMA is responsible for coordinating the implementation of national emergency preparedness policy with Federal departments and agencies and with state and local governments and, therefore, is responsible for developing a system of planning procedures for integrating the emergency preparedness actions of federal, state and local governments.</P>
            <P>(g) Federal departments and agencies shall design their preparedness measures to permit a rapid and effective transition from routine to emergency operations, and to make effective use of the period following initial indication of a probable national security emergency. This will include:</P>

            <P>(1) Development of a system of emergency actions that defines alternatives, processes, and issues to be considered <PRTPAGE P="503"/>during various stages of national security emergencies; and</P>
            <P>(2) Identification of actions that could be taken at the Federal and local levels of government in the early stages of a national security emergency or pending national security emergency to mitigate the impact of or reduce significantly the leadtime associated with full emergency action implementation.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 334.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Background.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The GMR system is designed to take into account the need to mobilize the Nation's resources in response to a wide range of crisis or emergency situations. GMR is a flexible decision making process of preparedness and response actions which are appropriate to warning indicators or an event. Thus, GMR allows the government, as a whole, to take small or large, often reversible, steps to increase its national security emergency preparedness posture.</P>
            <P>(b) Crises, especially those resulting in major military activities, always have some political or economic context. As the risks of military action increase, nations undertake more extensive preparations over a longer period of time to increase their military power. Such preparations by potential adversaries shape the nature and gravity of the threat as well as its likelihood and timing of occurrence. These measures permit the development of reliable indicators of threat at an early time in the evolution of a crisis. Depending on the nature of the situation or event and the nation involved, these early warning indicators may emanate from the political, socio-economic and/or industrial sectors.</P>
            <P>(c) The GMR system enables the nation to approach mobilization planning and actions as part of the deterrent response capability and to use it to reduce the probability of conflict. Alternatively, if deterrence should fail, the GMR system would enable the nation to undertake a series of phased actions intended to increase its ability to meet defense and essential civilian requirements. The GMR system integrates the potential strength of the national economy into U.S. national security strategy.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Graduated Mobilization Response</E> (GMR) is a system for integrating mobilization actions designed to respond to ambiguous and/or specific warnings. These actions are designed to mitigate the impact of an event or crisis and reduce significantly the lead time associated with a full national emergency action implementation.</P>

These actions would be designed to mitigate the impact of, or reduce significantly, the lead times associated with full emergency action implementation. Such plans are required by section 201(4)(b) of Executive Order 12656.</P>

            <SUBJECT>GMR system description.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The GMR system contains three stages of mobilization activity (additional intermediate GMR stages may be developed). For example, a Federal department or agency might divide “Crisis Management” into two, three, or more levels as suits its needs.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Stage 3, Planning and Preparation.</E> During the planning and preparation stage, Federal departments and agencies develop their GMR plans and maintain capability to carry out their mobilization-related responsibilities in <PRTPAGE P="504"/>accordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types of problems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along with possible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be undertaken to overcome identified problems.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Stage 2, Crisis Management.</E> During the crisis management stage, GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light of an actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.</P>
            <P>(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used even if the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be considered for implementation at this time.</P>
            <P>(2) Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through reprogramming, but the Costed Option Packages may also require new funding.</P>
            <P>(3) If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national emergency, it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile items for future use.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Stage 1, National Emergency/War.</E> During a national emergency or declaration of war, mobilization of all national resources escalates and GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilization effort. As military requirements increase, the national resources would increasingly be focused on the national security emergency. This would involve diverting non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetime to defense uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production. Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacity may also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required for most Federal departments and agencies having national security emergency responsibilities.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 334.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Department and agency responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) During Stage 3, each Federal department and agency with mobilization responsibilities will develop GMR plans as part of its emergency preparedness planning process in order to meet possible future crisis. Costed Option Packages will be developed for actions that may be necessary in the early warning period. Option packages will be reviewed, focused and refined during Stage 2 to meet the particular emergency.</P>
            <P>(b) Each department and agency should identify response actions appropriate for the early stage of any crisis or emergency situation, which then will be reviewed, focused and refined in Stage 2 for execution, as appropriate. GMR plans should contain a menu of costed option packages that provide details of alternative measures that may be used in an emergency situation.</P>
            <P>(c) FEMA will provide guidance pursuant to Executive Order 12656 and will coordinate GMR plans and option packages of DOD and the civilian departments and agencies to ensure consistency and to identify areas where additional planning or investment is needed.</P>
            <P>(d) During State 2, FEMA will coordinate department and agency recommendations for action and forward them to the National Security Advisor to make certain that consistency with the overall national strategy planning is achieved.</P>
            <P>(e) Departments and agencies will refine their GMR plans to focus on the specific crisis situation. Costed option packages should be refined to identify the resources necessary for the current crisis, action taken to obtain those resources, and GMR plans implemented consistent with the seriousness of the crisis.</P>

            <P>(f) At Stage 1, declaration of national emergency or war, the crisis is under the control of NSC or other central authority, with GMR being integrated into partial, full or total mobilization. At this point the more traditional mechanisms of resource mobilization <PRTPAGE P="505"/>are pursued, focusing on resource allocation and adjudication with cognizance of the essential civilian demand.</P>
            <P>(g) Programs and plans developed by the departments and agencies under this guidance should be shared, as appropriate, with States, local governments and the private sector to provide a baseline for their development of supporting programs and plans.</P>

Pursuant to section 201(15) of Executive Order 12656, departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall consult and coordinate with the Administrator of FEMA to ensure that their activities and plans are consistent with current National Security Council guidelines and policies. An evaluation of the Federal departments and agencies participation in the graduated mobilization response program may be included in these reports.</P>

            <P>(b) This assignment was given to FEMA because of its responsibilities under Executive Order 12148 to establish Federal policies for and coordinate civil emergency planning, management and assistance functions and to represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness programs. Under section 201 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5131), and other statutory functions, the Administrator of FEMA is charged with the responsibility to develop and implement plans and programs of disaster preparedness.</P>
            <P>(c) There are two sections in the NRC's fiscal year 1982/1983 Appropriation Authorization (Pub. L. 97-415) that pertain to the scope of this rule.</P>
            <P>(1) Section 5 provides for the issuance of an operating license for a commercial nuclear power plant by the NRC if it is determined that there exists a State, local or utility plan which provides assurance that public health and safety is not endangered by the operation of the facility. This section would allow the NRC to issue an operating license for such plants without FEMA-approved State and local government plans.</P>
            <P>(2) Section 11 provides for the issuance of temporary licenses for operating a utilization facility at a specific power level to be determined by the Commission, pending final action by the Commission on the application. Also, this section authorizes the NRC to issue temporary operating licenses for these facilities without the completion of the required (NRC) Commission hearing process. A petition for such a temporary license may not be filed until certain actions are completed including the submission of a State, local or utility emergency response plan for the facility.</P>

            <P>(d) To carry out these responsibilities, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort with State and local governments and other Federal agencies in the development of State and local plans and preparedness to cope with <PRTPAGE P="507"/>the offsite effects resulting from radiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities. FEMA developed and published the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan 50 FR 46542 Nov. 8, 1985, to provide the overall support to State and local governments, for all types of radiological incidents including those occurring at nuclear power plants.</P>
            <P>(e) FEMA has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the NRC to which it will furnish assessments, findings and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans and preparedness are adequate and continue to be capable of implementation (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). These findings and determinations will be used by NRC under its own rules in connection with its licensing and regulatory requirements and FEMA will support its findings in the NRC licensing process and related court proceedings.</P>
            <P>(f) Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in these rules for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings and determinations on the current status of emergency preparedness around particular sites may be requested by the NRC and provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. These findings and determinations may be based upon plans currently available to FEMA or furnished to FEMA by the NRC through the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.</P>
            <P>(g) An environmental assessment has been prepared on which FEMA has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for review and approval of State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Section 50.47 of NRC's Emergency Planning Rule (10 CFR parts 50 (appendix E) and 70 as amended) and the joint FEMA-NRC <E T="03">Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological Emergency Response Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants</E> (NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, November 1980) which apply insofar as FEMA is concerned to State and local governments, are to be used in reviewing, evaluating and approving State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness and in making any findings and determinations with respect to the adequacy of the plans and the capabilities of State and local governments to implement them. Both the planning and preparedness standards and related criteria contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are to be used by FEMA and the NRC in reviewing and evaluating State and local government radiological emergency plans and preparedness. For brevity, only the planning standards contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are presented below.</P>
            <P>(1) Primary responsibilities for emergency response by the nuclear facility licensee, and by State and local organizations within the Emergency Planning Zones have been assigned, the emergency responsibilities of the various supporting organizations have been specifically established and each principal response organization has staff to respond to and augment its initial response on a continuous basis.</P>

            <P>(2) On-shift facility licensee responsibilities for emergency response are <PRTPAGE P="508"/>unambiguously defined, adequate staffing to provide initial facility accident response in key functional areas is maintained at all times, timely augmentation of response capabilities is available and the interfaces among various onsite response activities and offsite support and response activities are specified. (This standard applies only to NRC licensees but is included here for completeness.)</P>
            <P>(3) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using assistance resources have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have been made and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned response have been identified.</P>
            <P>(4) A standard emergency classification and action level scheme, the bases of which include facility system and effluent parameters, is in use by the nuclear facility licensee, and State and local response plans call for reliance on information provided by facility licensees for determinations of minimum initial offsite response measures.</P>
            <P>(5) Procedures have been established for notification, by the licensee, of State and local response organizations and for the notification of emergency personnel by all response organizations; the content of initial and followup messages to response organizations and the public has been established; and means to provide early notification and clear instruction to the populace within the plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone have been established.</P>
            <P>(6) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal response organizations to emergency personnel and to the public.</P>
            <P>(7) Information is made available to the public on a periodic basis on how they will be notified and what their initial actions should be in an emergency (e.g., listening to a local broadcast station and remaining indoors), the principal points of contact with the news media for dissemination of information during an emergency (including the physical location or locations) are established in advance and procedures for coordinated dissemination of information to the public are established.</P>
            <P>(8) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the emergency response are provided and maintained.</P>
            <P>(9) Adequate methods, systems and equipment for assessing and monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological emergency condition are in use.</P>
            <P>(10) A range of protective actions has been developed for the plume exposure pathway EPZ for emergency workers and the public. Guidelines for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, are developed and in place and protective actions for the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ appropriate to the locale have been developed.</P>
            <P>(11) Means for controlling radiological exposures, in an emergency, are established for emergency workers. The means for controlling radiological exposures shall include exposure guidelines consistent with EPA Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action Guides.</P>
            <P>(12) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated injured individuals.</P>
            <P>(13) General plans for recovery and reentry are developed.</P>
            <P>(14) Periodic exercises are (will be) conducted to evaluate major portions of emergency response capabilities, periodic drills are (will be) conducted to develop and maintain key skills and deficiencies identified as a result of exercises or drills are (will be) corrected.</P>
            <P>(15) Radiological emergency response training is provided to those who may be called upon to assist in an emergency.</P>
            <P>(16) Responsibilities for plan development and review and for distribution of emergency plans are established, and planners are properly trained.</P>
            <P>(b) In order for State of local plans and preparedness to be approved, such plans and preparedness must be determined to adequately protect the public health and safety by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assistance in development of State and local plans.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An integrated approach to the development of offsite radiological emergency plans by States, localities and the licensees of NRC with the assistance of the Federal Government is the approach most likely to provide the best protection to the public. Hence, Federal agencies, including FEMA Regional staff, will be made available upon request to assist States and localities in the development of plans.</P>
            <P>(b) There now exists in each of the ten standard Federal Regions a Regional Assistance Committee (RAC) (formerly the Regional Advisory Committee) chaired by a FEMA Regional official and having members from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce. Whereas in 44 CFR part 351, the Department of Defense is listed as a potential member of the RACs, it is not listed in this rule because military nuclear facilities are not the subject of concern. The RACs will assist State and local government officials in the development of their radiological emergency response plans, and will review plans and observe exercises to evaluate the adequacy of these plans and related preparedness. This assistance does not include the actual writing of State and local government plans by RAC members.</P>
            <P>(c) In accomplishing the foregoing, the RACs will use the standards and criteria in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, and will render such technical assistance as may be required, appropriate to their agency mission and expertise. In observing and evaluating exercises, the RACs will identify, soon after an exercise, any deficiencies observed in the planning and preparedness effort including deficiencies in resources, training of staff, equipment, staffing levels and deficiencies in the qualifications of personnel.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 350.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Application by State for review and approval.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A State which seeks formal review and approval by FEMA of the State's radiological emergency plan shall submit an application for such review and approval to the FEMA Regional Administrator of the Region in which the State is located. The application, in the form of a letter from the Governor or from such other State official as the Governor may designate, shall contain one copy of the completed State plan, including coverage of response in the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ. The application will also include plans of all appropriate local governments. The application shall specify the site or sites for which plan approval is sought. For guidance on the local government plans that should be included with an application, refer to Part I.E. NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, entitled Contiguous Jurisdiction Governmental Emergency Planning (see (e)). Only a State may request formal review of State or local radiological emergency plans.</P>
            <P>(b) Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power facilities shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 Km) in radius and the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 Km) in radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a particular nuclear power facility shall be determined by State and local governments in consultation with FEMA and NRC taking into account such local conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes and local jurisdiction boundaries. The size of the EPZs may be determined by NRC in consultation with FEMA on a case-by-case basis for gas cooled reactors and for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 Mw thermal. The plans for the ingestion exposure pathway shall focus on such actions as are appropriate to protect the public from ingesting contaminated food and water.</P>

            <P>(c) A State may submit separately its plans for the EPZs and the local government plans related to individual nuclear power facilities. The purpose of separate submissions is to allow approval of a State plan, and of the plans necessary for specific nuclear power facilities in a multiple-facility State, while not approving or acting on the plans necessary for other nuclear <PRTPAGE P="510"/>power facilities within the State. If separate submissions are made, appropriate adjustments in the State plan may be necessary. In any event, FEMA approval of State plans and appropriate local government plans shall be site specific.</P>
            <P>(d) The applications shall contain a statement that the State plan, together with the appropriate local plans, is, in the opinion of the State, adequate to protect the public health and safety of its citizens living within the emergency planning zones for the nuclear power facilities included in the submission by providing reasonable assurance that State and local governments can and intend to effect appropriate protective measures offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.</P>
            <P>(e) FEMA and the States will make suitable arrangements in the case of overlapping or adjacent jurisdictions to permit an orderly assessment and approval of interstate or interregional plans.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Initial FEMA action on State plan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Regional Administrator shall acknowledge in writing within ten days the receipt of the State application.</P>

            <P>(b) FEMA shall publish a notice signed by the Regional Administrator or designee in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 30 days after receipt of the application, that an application from a State has been received and that copies are available at the Regional Office for review and copying in accordance with 44 CFR 5.26.</P>
            <P>(c) The Regional Administrator shall furnish copies of the plan to members of the RAC for their analysis and evaluation.</P>
            <P>(d) The Regional Administrator shall make a detailed review of the State plan, including those of local governments, and assess the capability of State and local governments to effectively implement the plan (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). Evaluation and comments of the RAC members will be used as part of the review process.</P>
            <P>(e) In connection with the review, the Regional Administrator may make suggestions to States concerning perceived gaps or deficiencies in the plans, and the State may amend the plan at any time prior to forwarding to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.</P>
            <P>(f) Two conditions for FEMA approval of State plans (including local government plans) are the requirements for an exercise (see § 350.9), and for public participation (see §§ 350.9 and 350.10.). These activities occur during the Regional review and prior to the forwarding of the plan to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exercises.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before a Regional Administrator can forward a State plan to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate for approval, the State, together with all appropriate local governments, must conduct a joint exercise of that State plan, involving full participation <SU>1</SU>

              <FTREF/> of appropriate local government entities, the State and the appropriate licensee of the NRC. To the extent achievable, this exercise shall include participation by appropriate Federal agencies. This exercise shall be observed and evaluated by FEMA and by representatives of other Federal agencies with membership on the RACs and by NRC with respect to licensee response. Within 48 hours of the completion of the exercise, a briefing involving the exercise participants and Federal observers shall be conducted by the Regional Administrator to discuss the preliminary results of the exercise. If the exercise discloses any deficiencies in the State and local plans, or the ability of the State and local governments to implement the plans, the FEMA representatives shall make them known promptly in writing to appropriate State officials. To the extent necessary, the State shall amend the plan to incorporate recommended changes or improvements or take other corrective measures, such as remedial exercises, <SU>1</SU> to <PRTPAGE P="511"/>demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that identified weaknesses have been corrected.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> See § 350.2 for definitions of “full participation” and “remedial exercises”.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(b) The Regional Administrator shall be the FEMA official responsible for certifying to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate that an exercise of the State plan has been conducted, and that changes and corrective measures in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section have been made.</P>
            <P>(c) State and local governments that have fully participated in a joint exercise within one year prior to the effective date of this final rule will have continuing approval of their radiological emergency plans and preparedness by following the frequency indicated in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section. State and local governments that have not fully participated in a joint exercise within one year prior to the effective date of this final rule will follow the frequency indicated in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section after completion of a joint exercise in which they have fully participated. If, in developing exercise schedules with State and local governments to implement the requirements in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section, the Regional Administrator finds that unusual hardships would result, he may seek relief from the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.</P>
            <P>(1) Each State which has a commercial nuclear power site within its boundaries or is within the 10-mile plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone of such site shall fully participate in an exercise jointly with the nuclear power plant licensee and appropriate local governments at least every two years.</P>
            <P>(2) Each State with multiple sites within its boundaries shall fully participate in a joint exercise at some site on a rotational basis at least every 2 years. When not fully participating in an exercise at a site, the State shall partially participate <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> at that site to support the full participation of appropriate local governments. Priority shall be given to new facilities seeking an operating license from the NRC and which have not fully participated in a joint exercise involving the State, local governments and the licensee at that site. State and local governments will coordinate the scheduling of these exercises with the appropriate FEMA and NRC Regional Offices and the affected licensees.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> See § 350.2 for definition of “partial exercise”.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(3) Each appropriate local government which has a site within its boundaries or is within the 10-mile emergency planning zone shall fully participate in a joint exercise with the licensee and the State at least every two years. For those local governments that have planning and preparedness responsibilities for more than one facility, the Regional Administrator may seek an exemption from this requirement by recommending alternative arrangements for approval by the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.</P>
            <P>(4) States within the 50-mile emergency planning zone of a site shall exercise their plans and preparedness related to ingestion exposure pathway measures at least once every five years in conjunction with a plume exposure pathway exercise for that site.</P>
            <P>(5) Remedial exercises may be required to correct deficiencies observed in exercises conducted for continued FEMA approval. Should this occur, the FEMA Regional Administrator will determine the participation required from the States and/or local governments.</P>

            <P>(d) Within 48 hours of the completion of an exercise conducted for continued FEMA approval, a briefing involving the exercise participants and Federal observers shall be conducted by the Regional Administrator to discuss the preliminary results of the exercise. If the exercise discloses any deficiencies in the State and local plans, or the ability of the State and local governments to implement the plans, the FEMA representatives shall make them known promptly in writing to appropriate State officials. To the extent necessary, the State shall amend the plan to incorporate recommended changes or improvements or take other corrective measures, such as remedial exercises, to demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that identified <PRTPAGE P="512"/>weaknesses have been corrected. The Regional Administrator shall forward his or her evaluation of the exercise conducted for continued FEMA approval to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate including the certification that changes and corrective measures have been made.</P>
            <P>(e) Following the exercise conducted for continued FEMA approval, the Regional Administrator shall conduct a meeting in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility which will include the exercise participants, representatives from the NRC and other appropriate Federal agencies and the public and media as observers. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the evaluation of the exercise. At the discretion of the Regional Administrator, written comments from the public and media may be submitted at or after the meeting. These comments will be taken into consideration by the Regional Administrator in his or her evaluation.</P>
            <P>(f) After FEMA approval of a State and local plan has been granted, failure to exercise the State and local plans at the frequency and participation described in this section shall be grounds for withdrawing FEMA approval. (See § 350.13.)</P>

            <P>(a) During the FEMA Regional Office review of a State plan and prior to the submission by the Regional Administrator of the evaluation of the plan and exercise to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, the FEMA Regional Administrator shall assure that there is at least one public meeting conducted in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility. The purpose of such a meeting, which may be conducted by the State or by the Regional Administrator, shall be to:</P>
            <P>(1) Acquaint the members of the public in the vicinity of each facility with the content of the State and related local plans, and with the conduct of the joint exercise which tested the plans;</P>
            <P>(2) Answer any questions about FEMA review of the plan and the exercise;</P>
            <P>(3) Receive suggestions from the public concerning improvements or changes that may be necessary; and</P>
            <P>(4) Describe to the public the way in which the plan is expected to function in the event of an actual emergency.</P>
            <P>(b) The Regional Administrator should assure that representatives from appropriate State and local government agencies, and the affected utility appear at such meetings to make presentations and to answer questions from the public. The public meeting should be held after the first joint (utility, State and local governments) exercise at a time mutually agreed to by State and local authorities, licensee and FEMA and NRC Regional officials. This meeting shall be noticed in the local newspaper with the largest circulation in the area, or other such media as the Regional Administrator may select, on at least two occasions, one of which is at least two weeks before the meeting takes place and the other is within a few days of the meeting date. Local radio and television stations should be notified of the scheduled meeting at least one week in advance. Representatives from NRC and other appropriate Federal agencies should also be invited to participate in these meetings. If, in the judgment of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the public meeting or meetings reveal deficiencies in the State plan and/or the joint exercise, the Regional Administrator shall inform the State of the fact together with recommendations for improvement. No FEMA approval of State and local plans and preparedness shall be made until a meeting described in this paragraph shall have been held at or near the nuclear power facility site for which the State is seeking approval.</P>

            <P>(a) Upon receipt from a Regional Administrator of a State plan, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall conduct such review of the State plan as he or she shall deem necessary. The Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall arrange for copies of the plan, together with the Regional Administrator's evaluation, to be made available to the members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee (FRPCC) and to other offices of FEMA with appropriate guidance relative to any assistance that may be needed in the FEMA review and approval process.</P>
            <P>(b) If, after formal submission of the State plan and the Regional Administrator's evaluation, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate determines that the State plans and preparedness:</P>
            <P>(1) Are adequate to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency; and</P>

            <P>(2) Are capable of being implemented (e.g. adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy); the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall approve in writing the State plan. The Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall concurrently communicate this FEMA approval to the Governor of the State(s) in question, the NRC and the pertinent Regional Administrator(s) and immediately shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of this effect.</P>

            <P>(c) If, after formal submission of the State plan, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate is not satisfied with the adequacy of the plan or preparedness with respect to a particular site, he or she shall concurrently communicate that decision to the Governor(s) of the State(s), the NRC and the pertinent Regional Administrator(s), together with a statement in writing explaining the reasons for the decision and requesting appropriate plan or preparedness revision. Such statement shall be transmitted to the Governor(s) through the appropriate Regional Administrator(s). The Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall immediately publish a notice to this effect in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <P>(a) If, at any time after granting approval of a State plan, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate determines, on his or her own initiative, motion or on the basis of information another person supplied, that the State or local plan is no longer adequate to protect public health and safety by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken, or is no longer capable of being implemented, he or she shall immediately advise the Governor of the affected State, through the appropriate Regional Administrator and the NRC of that initial determination in writing. FEMA shall spell out in detail the reasons for its initial determination, and shall describe the deficiencies in the plan or the preparedness of the State. If, after four months from the date of such an initial determination, the State in question has not either:</P>

            <P>(1) Corrected the deficiencies noted, or (2) submitted an acceptable plan for correcting those deficiencies, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall withdraw approval and shall immediately inform the NRC and the Governor of the affected State, of the determination to withdraw approval and shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the local newspaper having the largest daily circulation in the affected State notice of its withdrawal or approval. The basis upon which the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate makes the determination for withdrawal of approval is the same basis used for reviewing plans and exercises, i.e., the planning standards and related criteria in NUREGO654/FEMA/REP-1, Rev. 1.</P>
            <P>(b) In the event that the State in question shall submit a plan for correcting the deficiencies, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall negotiate a schedule and a timetable under which the State shall correct the deficiencies. If, on the agreed upon date, the deficiencies have been corrected, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall withdraw the initial determination and the approval previously granted shall remain valid. He or she shall inform the Governor(s), the NRC, the pertinent Regional Administrator(s) and notify the public as stated in paragraph (a) of this section. If, however, on the agreed upon date, the deficiencies are not corrected, FEMA shall withdraw its approval and shall communicate its decision to the Governor of the State whose plan is in question, the NRC, the appropriate Federal agencies and notify the public as indicated above.</P>
            <P>(c) Within 30 days after the date of notification of withdrawal of approval of a State or local plan, any interested person may appeal the decision of the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate to the Administrator; however, such an appeal must be made solely upon the ground that the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate's decision, based on the available record, was unsupported by substantial evidence. (See § 350.15 for appeal procedures.)</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 350.14</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Amendments to State plans.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The State may amend a plan submitted to FEMA for review and approval under § 350.7 at any time during the review process or may amend a plan at any time after FEMA approval has been granted under § 350.12. A State must amend its plan in order to extend the coverage of the plan to any new nuclear power facility which becomes operational after a FEMA approval or in case of any other significant change. The State plan shall remain in effect as approved while any significant change is under review.</P>

            <P>(b) A significant change is one which involves the evaluation and assessment of a planning standard or which involves a matter which, if presented <PRTPAGE P="515"/>with the plan, would need to have been considered by the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate in making a decision that State or local plans and preparedness are:</P>
            <P>(1) Adequate to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency; and</P>
            <P>(2) Capable of being implemented.</P>
            <P>(c) A significant change will be processed in the same manner as if it were an initial plan submission. However, the Regional Administrator may determine that certain procedures, such as holding a public meeting or a complete exercise, would be unnecessary. The existing FEMA approval shall remain in effect while any significant changes are under review.</P>
            <P>(d) Changes, such as a change in a telephone number, that are not significant as defined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, but are necessary to maintain currency of the plan, should be forwarded to the Regional Administrator.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Any interested person may appeal a decision made under §§ 350.12 and 350.13 of this part, by submitting to the Administrator, FEMA, a written notice of appeal, within 30 days after the appearance in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> of the notice of decision relating to the matter being appealed. The appeal must be addressed to the Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20472. The appeal letter shall state specific reasons for the appeal and include an offer to provide documentation supporting appellate arguments.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon receipt of an appeal, the Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall review the file, as submitted to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, by the Regional Administrator of the FEMA Region concerned, based on the information contained in the file and the appeal letter, with supporting documentation. The Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall decide whether or not the Associate Director's initial decision was supported by substantial evidence in the file and is consistent with FEMA policy.</P>

            <P>(c) The decision of the Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as the final agency decision on the matter and shall not be reviewable within FEMA, except upon a showing that it was procured by fraud or misrepresentation. In addition to publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> copies of the decision shall be forwarded to the appellant, the Governor(s) of the State(s) affected, the NRC and the affected licensee of the involved power facility.</P>

FEMA may enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) and other instruments with Federal agencies to provide technical assistance and to arrange for the commitment and utilization of Federal facilities and resources as necessary. FEMA also may use a MOU to delegate to another Federal agency, with the consent of that agency, any of the functions and duties assigned to FEMA. Following review and approval by OMB, FEMA will publish such documents in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <P>(a) Under 44 CFR part 351, the role of a RAC is to assist State and local government officials to develop their radiological emergency plans, to review the plans, and to observe exercises to evaluate the plans. Under subparts A and B of this part, these technical assistance activities are extended to the licensee.</P>
              <P>(b) Prior to a determination under subpart A (44 CFR 352.6(d)) that Federal facilities and resources are needed, the designated RAC for the specific site will assist the licensee, as necessary, in evaluating the need for Federal facilities and resources, in addition to providing technical assistance under § 352.23(a).</P>
              <P>(c) In accomplishing the foregoing, the RAC will use the standards and evaluation criteria in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 and Supp. 1. <SU>1</SU>

              <P>(a) Under a determination under subpart A (44 CFR 352.5(f) and 352.4(e)) that a decline or fail situation exists, FEMA and other Federal agencies will provide technical assistance to the licensee. Such assistance may be provided during the pendency of an appeal under § 352.29.</P>
              <P>(b) The applicable criteria for the use of Federal facilities and resources are set forth in subpart A (44 CFR 352.6(c)(1)(2)). Upon a determination under subpart A (44 CFR 352.6(d)) that Federal resources or facilities will be required, FEMA will consult with the FRPCC, the RAC, the individual Federal agencies, and the licensee, to determine the extent of Federal facilities and resources that the government could provide, and the most effective way to do so. After such consultation, FEMA will specifically request Federal agencies to provide those Federal facilities and resources. The Federal agencies, in turn, will respond to confirm the availability of such facilities and resources and provide estimates of their costs.</P>
              <P>(c) FEMA will inform the licensee in writing of the Federal support which will be provided. This information will identify Federal agencies which are to be included in the plan, the extent and purpose of technical assistance to be provided and the Federal facilities and resources to be committed, and the limitations of their use. The information will also describe the requirements for reimbursement to the Federal Government for this support.</P>
              <P>(d) FEMA will coordinate the Federal effort in implementing the determinations made under subpart A (44 CFR 352.5(f) and 352.6(d)) so that each Federal agency maintains the committed technical assistance, facilities, and resources after the licensee offsite emergency response plan is completed. FEMA and other Federal agencies will participate in training, exercises, and drills, in support of the licensee offsite emergency response plan.</P>
              <P>(e) In carrying out paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, FEMA will keep affected State and local governments informed of actions taken.</P>

The provision of this service consists of making a determination whether the plans are adequate to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency and that such plans are capable of being implemented.</P>
            <P>(c) NRC utility plan submissions. Fees will be charged for all FEMA but not other Federal agency activities related to such services, including but not limited to the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Development of exercise objectives and scenarios, preexercise logistics, exercise conduct and participation, evaluation and post-exercise meetings and reports.</P>
            <P>(2) Notice and conduct of public meeting.</P>
            <P>(3) Regional finding and determination of adequacy of plans and preparedness followed by review by FEMA Headquarters resulting in final FEMA determination of adequacy of plans and preparedness,</P>
            <P>(4) Remedial exercise, medical drill, or any other exercise or drill upon which maintenance of a license is predicated, with regard to preparation, review, conduct, participation, evaluation, meetings and reports.</P>

            <P>(d) Utility certification submission review. When a licensee seeks Federal assistance within the framework of 44 CFR part 352 due to the decline or failure of a State or local government to <PRTPAGE P="530"/>adequately prepare an emergency plan, FEMA shall process the licensee's certification and make the determination whether a decline or fail situation exists. Fees will be charged for services rendered in making the determination. Upon the determination that a decline or fail situation does exist, any services provided or secured by FEMA consisting of assistance to the licensee, as described in 44 CFR part 352, will have a fee charged for such services.</P>
            <P>(e) FEMA participation in site-specific NRC adjudicatory proceedings and any other site-specific legal costs. Where FEMA participates in NRC licensing proceedings and any related court actions to support FEMA findings as a result of its review and approval of offsite emergency plans and preparedness, or provides legal support for any other site specific FEMA activities comprised in this rule, fees will be charged to the licensee for such participation.</P>
            <P>(f) Rendering technical assistance. Where FEMA is requested by a licensee to provide any technical assistance, or where a State or local government requests technical assistance in order to correct an inadequacy identified as a result of a biennial exercise or any other drill or exercise upon which maintenance of a license is predicated, FEMA will charge such assistance to the licensee for the provision of such service.</P>

            <P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have entered into a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Relating to Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness. This supersedes a memorandum entered into on November 1, 1980 (published December 16, 1980, 45 FR 82713), revised April 9, 1985 (published April 18, 1985, 50 FR 15485), and published as Appendix A to 44 CFR part 353. The substantive changes in the new MOU are: (1) Self-initiated review by the NRC; (2) Early Site Permit process; (3) adoption of FEMA exercise time-frames; (4) incorporation of FEMA definition of exercise deficiency; (5) NRC commitment to work with licensees in support of State and local governments to correct exercise deficiencies; (6) correlation of FEMA actions on withdrawal of approvals under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC enforcement actions; and (7) disaster-initiated reviews in situations that affect offsite emergency infrastructures. The text of the MOU follows.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA Relating to Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Background and Purposes</HD>
            <P>This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes a framework of cooperation between the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in radiological emergency response planning matters so that their mutual efforts will be directed toward more effective plans and related preparedness measures at and in the vicinity of nuclear reactors and fuel cycle facilities which are subject to 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, and certain other fuel cycle and materials licensees which have potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases. The memorandum is responsive to the President's decision of December 7, 1979, that FEMA will take the lead in offsite planning and response, his request that NRC assist FEMA in carrying out this role, and the NRC's continuing statutory responsibility for the radiological health and safety of the public.</P>
            <P>On January 14, 1980, the two agencies entered into a “Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA to Accomplish a Prompt Improvement in Radiological Emergency Preparedness,” that was responsive to the President's December 7, 1979, statement. A revised and updated Memorandum of Understanding became effective November 1, 1980. The MOU was further revised and updated on April 9, 1985. This MOU is a further revision to reflect the evolving relationship between NRC and FEMA and the experience gained in carrying out the provisions of the previous MOU's. This MOU supersedes these two earlier versions of the MOU.</P>

            <P>The general principles agreed to in the previous MOU's and reaffirmed in this MOU, are as follows: FEMA coordinates all Federal <PRTPAGE P="531"/>planning for the offsite impact of radiological emergencies and takes the lead for assessing offsite radiological emergency response plans <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> and preparedness, makes findings and determinations as to the adequacy and capability of implementing offsite plans, and communicates those findings and determinations to the NRC. The NRC reviews those FEMA findings and determinations in conjunction with the NRC onsite findings for the purpose of making determinations on the overall state of emergency preparedness. These overall findings and determinations are used by NRC to make radiological health and safety decisions in the issuance of licenses and the continued operation of licensed plants to include taking enforcement actions as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors. This delineation of responsibilities avoids duplicative efforts by the NRC staff in offsite preparedness matters. However, if FEMA informs the NRC that an emergency, unforeseen contingency, or other reason would prevent FEMA from providing a requested finding in a reasonable time, then, in consultation with FEMA, the NRC might initiate its own review of offsite emergency preparedness.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> Assessments of offsite plans may be based on State and local government plans submitted to FEMA under its rule (44 CFR Part 350), and as noted in 44 CFR 350.3(f), may also be based on plans currently available to FEMA or furnished to FEMA through the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>A separate MOU dated October 22, 1980, deals with NRC/FEMA cooperation and responsibilities in response to an actual or potential radiological emergency. Operations Response Procedures have been developed that implement the provisions of the Incident Response MOU. These documents are intended to be consistent with the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan which describes the relationships, roles, and responsibilities of Federal Agencies for responding to accidents involving peacetime nuclear emergencies. On December 1, 1991, the NRC and FEMA also concluded a separate MOU in support of Executive Order 12657 (FEMA Assistance in Emergency Preparedness Planning at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Authorities and Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>FEMA-Executive Order 12148 charges the Director, FEMA, with the responsibility to “* * * establish Federal policies for, and coordinate, all civil defense and civil emergency planning, management, mitigation, and assistance functions of Executive agencies” (Section 2-101) and “* * * represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery programs” (Section 2-104.).</P>
            <P>On December 7, 1979, the President, in response to the recommendations of the Kemeny Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, directed that FEMA assume lead responsibility for all offsite nuclear emergency planning and response.</P>
            <P>Specifically, the FEMA responsibilities with respect to radiological emergency preparedness as they relate to NRC are:</P>
            <P>1. To take the lead in offsite emergency planning and to review and assess offsite emergency plans and preparedness for adequacy.</P>
            <P>2. To make findings and determinations as to whether offsite emergency plans are adequate and can be implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment). Notwithstanding the procedures which are set forth in 44 CFR part 350 for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings, and determinations on the current status of emergency planning and preparedness around particular sites, referred to as interim findings, will be provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. Such findings will be provided by FEMA on mutually agreed to schedules or on specific NRC request. The request and findings will normally be by written communications between the co-chairs of the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee. An interim finding provided under this arrangement will be an extension of FEMA's procedures for review and approval of offsite radiological emergency plans and preparedness set forth in 44 CFR part 350. It will be based on the review of currently available plans and, if appropriate, joint exercise results related to a specific nuclear power plant site.</P>
            <P>If the review involves an application under 10 CFR part 52 for an early site permit, the NRC will forward to FEMA pertinent information provided by the applicant and consult with FEMA as to whether there is any significant impediment to the development of offsite emergency plans. As appropriate, depending upon the nature of information provided by the applicant, the NRC will also request that FEMA determine whether major features of offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are acceptable, or whether offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are adequate, as discussed below.</P>

            <P>An interim finding based only on the review of currently available offsite plans will include an assessment as to whether these plans are adequate when measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, and, pending a demonstration <PRTPAGE P="532"/>through an exercise, whether there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented. The finding will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) Plans are adequate and there is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented with only limited or no corrections needed; (2) plans are adequate, but before a determination can be made as to whether they can be implemented, corrections must be made to the plans or supporting measures must be demonstrated (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment) or (3) plans are inadequate and cannot be implemented until they are revised to correct deficiencies noted in the Federal review.</P>
            <P>If, in FEMA's view, the plans that are available are not completed or are not ready for review, FEMA will provide NRC with a status report delineating milestones for preparation of the plan by the offsite authorities as well as FEMA's actions to assist in timely development and review of the plans.</P>
            <P>An interim finding on preparedness will be based on review of currently available plans and joint exercise results and will include an assessment as to (1) whether offsite emergency plans are adequate as measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1 and (2) whether the exercise(s) demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented.</P>
            <P>An interim finding on preparedness will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in an exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision.</P>
            <P>3. To assume responsibility, as a supplement to State, local, and utility efforts, for radiological emergency preparedness training of State and local officials.</P>
            <P>4. To develop and issue an updated series of interagency assignments which delineate respective agency capabilities and responsibilities and define procedures for coordination and direction for emergency planning and response. [Current assignments are in 44 CFR part 351, March 11, 1982. (47 FR 10758)]</P>
            <P>NRC-The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires that the NRC grant licenses only if the health and safety of the public is adequately protected. While the Atomic Energy Act does not specifically require emergency plans and related preparedness measures, the NRC requires consideration of overall emergency preparedness as a part of the licensing process. The NRC rules (10 CFR 50.33, 50.34, 50.47, 50.54, and appendix E to 10 CFR part 50, and 10 CFR part 52) include requirements for the licensee's emergency plans.</P>
            <P>Specifically, the NRC responsibilities for radiological emergency preparedness are:</P>
            <P>1. To assess licensee emergency plans for adequacy. This review will include organizations with whom licensees have written agreements to provide onsite support services under emergency conditions.</P>
            <P>2. To verify that licensee emergency plans are adequately implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment).</P>
            <P>3. To review the FEMA findings and determinations as to whether offsite plans are adequate and can be implemented.</P>
            <P>4. To make radiological health and safety decisions with regard to the overall state of emergency preparedness (i.e., integration of emergency preparedness onsite as determined by the NRC and offsite as determined by FEMA and reviewed by NRC) such as assurance for continued operation, for issuance of operating licenses, or for taking enforcement actions, such as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. Areas of Cooperation</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. NRC Licensing Reviews</HD>
            <P>FEMA will provide support to the NRC for licensing reviews related to reactors, fuel facilities, and materials licensees with regard to the assessment of the adequacy of offsite radiological emergency response plans and preparedness. This will include timely submittal of an evaluation suitable for inclusion in NRC safety evaluation reports.</P>
            <P>Substantially prior to the time that a FEMA evaluation is required with regard to fuel facility or materials license review, NRC will identify those fuel and materials licensees with potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases and transmit a request for review to FEMA as the emergency plans are completed.</P>
            <P>FEMA routine support will include providing assessments, findings and determinations (interim and final) on offsite plans and preparedness related to reactor license reviews. To support its findings and determinations, FEMA will make expert witnesses available before the Commission, the NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, NRC hearing boards and administrative law judges, for any court actions, and during any related discovery proceedings.</P>

            <P>FEMA will appear in NRC licensing proceedings as part of the presentation of the NRC staff. FEMA counsel will normally present FEMA witnesses and be permitted, at the discretion of the NRC licensing board, to cross-examine the witnesses of parties, other than the NRC witnesses, on matters involving FEMA findings and determinations, policies, or operations; however, FEMA will not be asked to testify on status reports. <PRTPAGE P="533"/>FEMA is not a party to NRC proceedings and, therefore, is not subject to formal discovery requirements placed upon parties to NRC proceedings. Consistent with available resources, however, FEMA will respond informally to discovery requests by parties. Specific assignment of professional responsibilities between NRC and FEMA counsel will be primarily the responsibility of the attorneys assigned to a particular case. In situations where questions of professional responsibility cannot be resolved by the attorneys assigned, resolution of any differences will be made by the General Counsel of FEMA and the General Counsel of the NRC or their designees. NRC will request the presiding Board to place FEMA on the service list for all litigation in which it is expected to participate.</P>
            <P>Nothing in this MOU shall be construed in any way to diminish NRC's responsibility for protecting the radiological health and safety of the public.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. FEMA Review of Offsite Plans and Preparedness</HD>
            <P>NRC will assist in the development and review of offsite plans and preparedness through its membership on the Regional Assistance Committees (RAC). FEMA will chair the Regional Assistance Committees. Consistent with NRC's statutory responsibility, NRC will recognize FEMA as the interface with State and local governments for interpreting offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness criteria as they affect those governments and for reporting to those governments the results of any evaluation of their radiological emergency plans and preparedness.</P>
            <P>Where questions arise concerning the interpretation of the criteria, such questions will continue to be referred to FEMA Headquarters, and when appropriate, to the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee to assure uniform interpretation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Preparation for and Evaluation of Joint Exercises</HD>
            <P>FEMA and NRC will cooperate in determining exercise requirements for licensees, and State and local governments. They will also jointly observe and evaluate exercises. NRC and FEMA will institute procedures to enhance the review of objectives and scenarios for joint exercises. This review is to assure that both the onsite considerations of NRC and the offsite considerations of FEMA are adequately addressed and integrated in a manner that will provide for a technically sound exercise upon which an assessment of preparedness capabilities can be based. The NRC/FEMA procedures will provide for the availability of exercise objectives and scenarios sufficiently in advance of scheduled exercises to allow enough time for adequate review by NRC and FEMA and correction of any deficiencies by the licensee. The failure of a licensee to develop a scenario that adequately addresses both onsite and offsite considerations may result in NRC taking enforcement actions.</P>
            <P>The FEMA reports will be a part of an interim finding on emergency preparedness; or will be the result of an exercise conducted pursuant to FEMA's review and approval procedures under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC's requirement under 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, Section IV.F. Exercise evaluations will identify one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in the exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision. The schedule for issuance of the draft and final exercise reports will be as shown in FEMA-REP-14 (Radiological Emergency Preparedness Exercise Manual).</P>
            <P>The deficiency referred to in (2) above is defined as an observed or identified inadequacy of organizational performance in an exercise that could cause a finding that offsite emergency preparedness is not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. Because of the potential impact of deficiencies on emergency preparedness, they should be corrected within 120 days through appropriate remedial actions, including remedial exercises, drills, or other actions.</P>
            <P>Where there are deficiencies of the types noted above, and when there is a potential for remedial actions, FEMA Headquarters will promptly (1-2 days) discuss these with NRC Headquarters. Within 10 days of the exercise, official notification of identified deficiencies will be made by FEMA to the State, NRC Headquarters, and the RAC with an information copy to the licensee. NRC will formally notify the licensee of the deficiencies and monitor the licensee's efforts to work with State and local authorities to correct the deficiencies. Approximately 60 days after official notification of the deficiency, the NRC, in consultation with FEMA, will assess the progress being made toward resolution of the deficiencies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Withdrawal of Reasonable Assurance Finding</HD>

            <P>If FEMA determines under 44 CFR 350.13 of its regulations that offsite emergency plans or preparedness are not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public, FEMA shall, as described in its rule, withdraw approval.<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
            </P>
            <P>Upon receiving notification of such action from FEMA, the NRC will promptly review FEMA's findings and determinations and formally document the NRC's position. When, as described in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2)(ii) and 50.54(s)(3) of its regulations, the NRC finds the state of emergency preparedness does not provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency, the NRC will notify the affected licensee accordingly and start the “120-day clock.” <SU>2</SU>

            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>2</SU> Per 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2)(ii), the Commission will determine whether the reactor shall be shut down or other appropriate enforcement actions if such conditions are not corrected within four months. The NRC is not limited by this provision of the rule, for, as stated in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(3), “Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Commission to take action under any other regulation or authority of the Commission <E T="03">or at any time other than that specified in this paragraph</E>” (emphasis added).</P>
            </FTNT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. Emergency Planning and Preparedness Guidance</HD>
            <P>NRC has lead responsibility for the development of emergency planning and preparedness guidance for licensees. FEMA has lead responsibility for the development of radiological emergency planning and preparedness guidance for State and local agencies. NRC and FEMA recognize the need for an integrated, coordinated approach to radiological emergency planning and preparedness by NRC licensees and State and local governments. NRC and FEMA will each, therefore, provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on such guidance (including interpretations of agreed joint guidance) prior to adoption as formal agency guidance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">F. Support for Document Management System</HD>
            <P>FEMA and NRC will each provide the other with continued access to those automatic data processing support systems which contain relevant emergency preparedness data.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">G. Ongoing NRC Research and Development Programs</HD>
            <P>Ongoing NRC and FEMA research and development programs that are related to State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness will be coordinated. NRC and FEMA will each provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on relevant research and development programs prior to implementing them.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">H. Public Information and Education Programs</HD>
            <P>FEMA will take the lead in developing public information and educational programs. NRC will assist FEMA by reviewing for accuracy educational materials concerning radiation, and its hazards and information regarding appropriate actions to be taken by the general public in the event of an accident involving radioactive materials.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">I. Recovery from Disasters Affecting Offsite Emergency Preparedness</HD>
            <P>Disasters that destroy roads, buildings, communications, transportation resources or other offsite infrastructure in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant can degrade the capabilities of offsite response organizations in the 10-mile plume emergency planning zone. Examples of events that could cause such devastation are hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, major fires, large explosions, and riots.</P>
            <P>If a disaster damages the area around a licensed operating nuclear power plant to an extent that FEMA seriously questions the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness, FEMA will inform the NRC promptly. Likewise, the NRC will inform FEMA promptly of any information it receives from licensees, its inspectors, or others, that raises serious questions about the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness. If FEMA concludes that a disaster-initiated review of offsite radiological emergency preparedness is necessary to determine if offsite emergency preparedness is still adequate, it will inform the NRC in writing, as soon as practicable, including a schedule for conduct of the review. FEMA will also give the NRC (1) interim written reports of its findings, as appropriate, and (2) a final written report on the results of its review.</P>
            <P>The disaster-initiated review is performed to reaffirm the radiological emergency preparedness capabilities of affected offsite jurisdictions located in the 10-mile emergency planning zone and is not intended to be a comprehensive review of offsite plans and preparedness.</P>
            <P>The NRC will consider information provided by FEMA Headquarters and pertinent findings from FEMA's disaster-initiated review in making decisions regarding the restart or continued operation of an affected operating nuclear power reactor. The NRC will notify FEMA Headquarters, in writing, of the schedule for restart of an affected reactor and keep FEMA Headquarters informed of changes in that schedule.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">IV. NRC/FEMA Steering Committee</HD>

            <P>The NRC/FEMA Steering Committee on Emergency Preparedness will continue to be <PRTPAGE P="535"/>the focal point for coordination of emergency planning and preparedness. As discussed in Section I of this agreement, response activities between these two agencies are addressed in a separate MOU. The Steering Committee will consist of an equal number of members to represent each agency with one vote per agency. When the Steering Committee cannot agree on the resolution of an issue, the issue will be referred to NRC and FEMA management. The NRC members will have lead responsibility for licensee planning and preparedness and the FEMA members will have lead responsibility for offsite planning and preparedness. The Steering Committee will assure coordination of plans and preparedness evaluation activities and revise, as necessary, acceptance criteria for licensee, State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness. NRC and FEMA will then consider and adopt criteria, as appropriate, in their respective jurisdictions. (See Attachment 1).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

            <P>This part establishes the methodology for FEMA to assess and collect user fees from Nuclear Regulatory <PRTPAGE P="536"/>Commission (NRC) licensees of commercial nuclear power plants to recover at least 100 percent of the amounts that we anticipate to obligate for our Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program as authorized under Title III, Public Law 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2502. Public Law 105-276 established in the Treasury a Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund, to be available under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 et. seq.), and under Executive Order 12657 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 611), for offsite radiological emergency planning, preparedness, and response. Beginning in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter, the Administrator of FEMA must publish fees to be assessed and collected, applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. The methodology for assessment and collection of fees must be fair and equitable and must reflect the full amount of costs of providing radiological emergency planning, preparedness, response and associated services. Our assessment of fees include our costs for use of agency resources for classes of regulated persons and our administrative costs to collect the fees. Licensees deposit fees by electronic transfer into the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund in the U.S. Treasury as offsetting collections.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assessment of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) We assess user fees from licensees using a methodology that includes charges for REP Program services provided by both our personnel and our contractors. Beginning in FY 1995, we established a four-year cycle from FY 1995-1998 with predetermined user fee assessments that were collected each year of the cycle. The following six-year cycle will run from FY 1999 through FY 2004. The fee for each site consists of two distinct components:</P>
            <P>(i) A <E T="03">site-specific, biennial exercise-related component</E> to recover the portion of the REP program budget associated only with plume pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ) biennial exercise-related activities. We determine this component by reviewing average biennial exercise-related activities/hours that we use in exercises conducted since the inception of our REP user fee program in 1991. We completed an analysis of REP Program activities/hours used during the FY 1991-1995 cycle at the end of that four-year cycle. We will make adjustments to the site-specific user fees for the next proposed FY 1999-2004 six-year cycle.</P>
            <P>(ii) A <E T="03">flat fee component</E> that is the same for each site and recovers the remaining portion of the REP Program budgeted funding that does not include biennial exercise-related activities.</P>
            <P>(2) We will assess fees only for REP Program services provided by our personnel and by our contractors, and we will not assess fees for those services that other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RAC's provide.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for our personnel.</E> We will determine an average biennial exercise-related cost for our personnel for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average number of hours spent by our personnel in REP exercise-related activities for each site. We will determine the average number of hours using an analysis of site-specific exercise activity spent since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We determine the actual user fee assessment for this component by multiplying the average number of REP exercise-related hours that we determine and annualize for each site by the average hourly rate in effect for the fiscal year for a REP Program employee. We will revise the hourly rate annually to reflect actual budget and cost of living factors, but the number of annualized, site-specific exercise hours will remain constant for user fee calculations and assessments throughout the six-year cycle. We will continue to track and monitor exercise activity during the six-year cycle, FY <PRTPAGE P="538"/>1999-2004. We will make appropriate adjustments to this component to calculate user fee assessments for later six-year cycles.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for FEMA contract personnel.</E> We have determined an average biennial exercise-related cost for REP contractors for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average costs of contract personnel in REP site-specific exercise-related activities since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We will continue to track and monitor activity during the initial six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004, and we will make appropriate adjustments to this component for calculation of user fee assessments during subsequent six-year cycles.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of flat fee component.</E> For each year of the six-year cycle, we recover the remainder of REP Program budgeted funds as a flat fee component. Specifically, we determine the flat fee component by subtracting the total of our personnel and contractor site-specific, biennial exercise-related components, as outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, from the total REP budget for that fiscal year. We then divide the resulting amount equally among the total number of licensed commercial nuclear power plant sites (defined under 354.2) to arrive at each site's flat fee component for that fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Discontinuation of charges.</E> When we receive a copy from the NRC of their approved exemption to 10 CFR 50.54(q) requirements stating that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness are no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, we will discontinue REP Program services at that site. We will no longer assess a user fee for that site from the beginning of the next fiscal year.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Emergency Management Training Program is designed to enhance the States' emergency management training program to increase State capabilities and those of local governments in this field, as well as to give States the opportunity to develop new capabilities and techniques. The Program is an ongoing intergovernmental endeavor which combines financial and human resources to fill the unique training needs of local government, State emergency staffs and State agencies, as well as the general public. States will have the opportunity to develop, implement and evaluate various approaches to accomplish FEMA emergency objectives as well as goals and objectives of their own. The intended result is an enhanced capability to protect lives and property through planning, mitigation, operational skill, and rapid response in case of disaster or attack on this country.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 360.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Description of program.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The program is designed for all States regardless of their present level of involvement in training or their degree of expertise in originating and presenting training courses in the past. The needs of individual States, difference in numbers to be trained, and levels of sophistication in any previous training program have been recognized. It is thus believed that all States are best able to meet their own unique situations and those of local government by being given this opportunity and flexibility.</P>
            <P>(b) Each State is asked to submit an acceptable application, to be accompanied by a Training and Education (T&amp;E) plan for a total of three years, only the first year of which will be required to be detailed. The remaining two year program should be presented in terms of ongoing training objectives and programs. In the first year plan applicants shall delineate their objectives in training and education, including a description of the programs to be offered, and identify the audiences and numbers to be trained. Additionally, the State is asked to note the month in which the activity is to be presented, the location, and cost estimates including instructional costs and participant's travel and per diem. These specifics of date, place, and costs will be required for the first year of any three year plan. A three year plan will be submitted each year with an application. Each negotiated agreement will include a section of required training (Radiological Defense), and a section including optional courses to be conducted in response to State and local needs.</P>
            <P>(c) FEMA support to the States in their training program for State and local officials, has been designed around three Program elements. Each activity listed in the State Training and Education (T&amp;E) Plan will be derived from the following three elements:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Government Conducted Courses:</E> Such courses require the least capability on the part of the State. They are usually conducted through provisions in a FEMA Regional Support Contract and/or FEMA or other Federal agency staff. The State's responsibilities fall primarily into administrative areas of recruiting participants, making all arrangements for the facilities needed for presentation of the course, and the handling of the cost reimbursement to participants, though State staff may participate as instructors. These courses for example include:</P>
            <P>(i) Career Development Courses: Phases I, II, and III,</P>
            <P>(ii) Radiological Officer and Instructor Courses,</P>
            <P>(iii) Technical Workshops on Disaster Recovery or Hazard Mitigation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Government and recipient conducted courses:</E> Responsibilities in these courses fall jointly upon Federal and State government as agreed in the planning for the course. Courses in this category might include:</P>
            <P>(i) Emergency Management Workshops,</P>
            <P>(ii) Multijurisdictional Emergency Operations Simulation Training.</P>
            <FP>In this category also, it is expected that the State will be responsible for administrative and logistical requirements, plus any instructional activity as agreed upon prior to the conduct of the course.</FP>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Recipient conducted courses:</E> This element requires the greatest degree of <PRTPAGE P="541"/>sophistication in program planning and delivery on the part of the State. Training events proposed by the State must be justified as addressing Emergency Management Training Program objectives. Additionally, they must address State or community needs and indicate the State's ability to present and carry out the Program of Instruction. Courses in this category could include:</P>
            <P>(i) Radiological Monitoring,</P>
            <P>(ii) Emergency Operations Simulating Training,</P>
            <P>(iii) Shelter Management.</P>
            <P>(d) In order that this three year comprehensive Training and Education Program planning can proceed in a timely and logical manner, each State will be provided three target appropriation figures, one for each of the three program years. States will develop their proposals, using the target figure to develop their scope of work. Adjustments in funding and the scope of work will be subject to negotiation before finalization. Both the funding and the scope of work will be reviewed each year and adjustments in the out years will reflect increased sophistication and expertise of the States as well as changing training needs within each State.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) FEMA funding through the State Cooperative Agreement for the training activities is to be used for travel and per diem expenses of students selected by the States for courses reflecting individually needed or required training. Additionally funds may be expended for course materials and instructor expenses. The funding provided in the State Cooperative Agreement is not for the purpose of conducting ongoing State activities or for funding staff positions to accomplish work to be performed under this Agreement. Nor is the Agreement for the purpose of purchasing equipment which may be obtained with the help of Personnel and Administrative funds. In cases where equipment has been identified as needed in the scope of work submitted with the application, and where it serves as an outreach to a new audience or methodology, equipment purchase may be approved at the time of initial application approval.</P>
            <P>(2) Allowable cost will be funded at 100%.</P>

They include specific activities or projects related to earthquake hazards reduction which fall into one or more of the following categories: Preparedness and response planning; mitigation planning and implementation, including inventories preparation, seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety; and public awareness and education. The activities that will actually be funded shall be determined through individual negotiations between FEMA and the States (see criteria in § 361.3(3)).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Project description.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An objective of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act is to develop, in areas of seismic risk, improved understanding of and capability with respect to earthquake-related issues, including methods of mitigating earthquake damage, planning to prevent or minimize earthquake damage, disseminating warnings of earthquakes, organizing emergency services, and planning for post-earthquake recovery. To achieve this objective, FEMA has implemented an earthquake hazards reduction assistance program for State and local governments in seismic risk areas.</P>

              <P>(b) This assistance program provides funding for earthquake hazards reduction activities which are eligible according to the definition in § 361.2. The categories, or program elements, listed <PRTPAGE P="544"/>therein comprise a comprehensive earthquake hazards reduction project for any given seismic hazard area. Key aspects of each of these elements are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Mitigation</E> involves developing and implementing strategies for reducing losses from earthquakes by incorporating principles of seismic safety into public and private decisions regarding the siting, design, and construction of structures (i.e., updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety), and regarding buildings' nonstructural elements, contents and furnishings. Mitigation includes preparing inventories of and conducting seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, and developing plans for identifying and retrofitting existing structures that pose threats to life or would suffer major damage in the event of a serious earthquake.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preparedness/response planning</E> are closely related and usually considered as one comprehensive activity. They do differ, however, in that preparedness planning involves those efforts undertaken before an earthquake to prepare for or improve capability to respond to the event, while response planning can be defined as the planning necessary to implement an effective response once the earthquake has occurred. Preparedness/response planning usually considers functions related to the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Rescue and fire services;</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical services;</P>
              <P>(iii) Damage assessments;</P>
              <P>(iv) Communications;</P>
              <P>(v) Security;</P>
              <P>(vi) Restoration of lifeline and utility services;</P>
              <P>(vii) Transportation;</P>
              <P>(viii) Sheltering, food and water supplies;</P>
              <P>(ix) Public health and information services;</P>
              <P>(x) Post-disaster recovery and the return of economic stability;</P>
              <P>(xi) Secondary impacts, such as dam failures, toxic releases, etc.; and</P>
              <P>(xii) Organization and management.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Public awareness/earthquake education</E> activities are designed to increase public awareness of earthquakes and their associated risks, and to stimulate behavioral changes to foster a self-help approach to earthquake preparedness, response, and mitigation. Audiences that may be targeted for such efforts include:</P>
              <P>(i) The general public;</P>
              <P>(ii) School populations (administrators, teachers, students, and parents);</P>
              <P>(iii) Special needs groups (e.g., elderly, disabled, non-English speaking);</P>
              <P>(iv) Business and industry;</P>
              <P>(v) Engineers, architects, builders;</P>
              <P>(vi) The media; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Public officials.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Other Activities</E> in support of those listed in § 361.3(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) may include, but are not limited to, State seismic advisory boards which provide State and local officials responsible for implementing earthquake hazards reduction projects with expert advice in a variety of fields; hazard identification which defines the potential for earthquakes and their related geological hazards in a particular area; and vulnerability assessments, also known as loss estimation studies, which provide information on the impacts and consequences of an earthquake on an area's resources, as well as opportunities for earthquake hazards mitigation.</P>
              <P>(c) State eligibility for financial assistance to States under this section is determined by FEMA based on a combination of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) Seismic hazard, including the historic occurrence of damaging earthquakes, as well as probable seismic activity;</P>
              <P>(2) Total population and major urban concentrations exposed to such risk; and</P>
              <P>(3) Other factors, the loss, damage, or disruption of which by a severe earthquake would have serious national impacts upon national security, such as industrial concentrations, concentrations or occurrences of natural resources, financial/economic centers and national defense facilities.</P>
              <P>(d) Each fiscal year, FEMA will establish a target allocation of earthquake program funds for each eligible State.</P>

              <P>(e) The specific activities, and the distribution of funds among them, that will be undertaken with this assistance will be determined during the annual <PRTPAGE P="545"/>Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement (CCA) negotiations between FEMA and the State, and will be based upon the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The availability of information regarding identification of seismic hazards and vulnerability to those hazards;</P>
              <P>(2) Earthquake hazards reduction accomplishments of the State to date;</P>
              <P>(3) State and Federal priorities for needed earthquake hazards reduction activities; and</P>
              <P>(4) State and local capabilities with respect to staffing, professional expertise, and funding.</P>
              <P>(f) As a condition of receiving FEMA funding, a percentage of the amount of the total State project (FEMA State assistance, combined with the State match) must be spent for activities under the Mitigation Planning element. The percentage, to be determined by FEMA, may be increased by no more than 5 percent annually, beginning at 15 percent in fiscal year 1991 with a limit of 50 percent of the total State project. The increase will take into account the amount of time a State has been participating in the program. States may expend more than the required percentage of funding on eligible mitigation activities.</P>
              <P>(g) The State match may be distributed among the eligible activities in any manner that is mutually agreed upon by FEMA and the State in the CCA negotiations.</P>
              <P>(h) Negotiations between FEMA and the State regarding the scope of work and the determination of the amount of State assistance to be awarded shall consider earthquake hazards reduction activities previously accomplished by the State, as well as the quality of their performance.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 361.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Matching contributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All State assistance will be cost shared after the first year of funding. States which received a grant before October 1, 1990, which included the 50 percent non-Federal contribution to the State program, will continue to match the Federal funds on a 50 percent cash match basis.</P>
              <P>(b) States which did not receive a grant before October 1, 1990, will assume cost sharing on a phased-in basis over a period of four years with the full cost sharing requirements being implemented in the fourth year. The sequence is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For the first fiscal year, cost sharing will be voluntary. FEMA will provide State assistance without requiring a State match. Those States that are able to cost-share are encouraged to do so (on either a cash or in-kind basis).</P>
              <P>(2) For the second fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 25 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution. Those States that are able to cost-share on a cash-contribution basis are encouraged to do so.</P>
              <P>(3) For the third fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 35 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution. Those States that are able to cost-share on a cash-contribution basis are encouraged to do so.</P>
              <P>(4) For the fourth and subsequent fiscal years, full cost sharing will be implemented, requiring a minimum of a 50 percent non-Federal contribution to a State program, with this share required to be cash. In-kind matching will no longer be acceptable. Thus, every dollar FEMA provides to a State must be matched by one dollar from the State. States that can contribute an amount greater than that required by the match are permitted and encouraged to do so. However, State assistance will not exceed the established target allocation.</P>
              <P>(c) The State contribution need not be applied at the exact time of the obligation of the Federal funds. However, the State full matching share must be obligated by the end of the project period for which the State assistance has been made available for obligation under an approved program or budget.</P>
              <P>(d) In the event a State interrupts its participation in this program, if it later elects to participate again, the nature and amount of that State's cost sharing shall be determined by the regulations then in effect, taking into account the number of years in which the State previously participated.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for program assistance, matching contributions, and return of program assistance funds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to qualify for assistance, a State must:</P>
              <P>(1) Demonstrate that the assistance will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide a share of the costs of the activities for which assistance is being given, in accordance with § 361.4; and</P>
              <P>(3) Demonstrate that it is taking actions to ensure its ability to meet the 50 percent cash contribution commitment either on an ongoing basis or for new States, by the fourth year of funding.</P>
              <P>(i) The Governor of newly participating State must certify to the FEMA Regional Administrator the State will take steps to meet the 50 percent cash contribution requirement after the third year of funding. The specific steps to be taken will be outlined in the certification which must be submitted prior to the State receiving program funds.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Governor must certify the State's continued commitment in the second and third years of funding. The certification will describe the progress made on the steps contained in the previous year's certification and steps to be taken in the future. The certification must be submitted to the Regional Administrator before the State will receive program funds.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a State encounters difficulties meeting the 50 percent cash contribution requirement for the target allocation following the fourth year of funding, the Regional Administrator may require the Governor to continue certifying the State is working to resolve the difficulty.</P>
              <P>(iv) A State will not receive Federal funds if it cannot provide the required cash contribution.</P>
              <P>(b) The value of any resources accepted as a matching share under one Federal agreement or program cannot be counted again as a contribution under another.</P>
              <P>(c) The State seeking the match shall submit documentation sufficient for FEMA to determine that the contribution meets the following requirements. The match shall be:</P>
              <P>(1) Necessary and reasonable for proper, cost-effective and efficient administration of the project, allocable solely thereto, and except as specifically provided herein, not be a general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of State and local governments;</P>
              <P>(2) Verifiable from the recipient State's records;</P>
              <P>(3) Not allocable to or included as a cost of any other Federally financed program in either the current or a prior period;</P>
              <P>(4) Authorized under State law;</P>
              <P>(5) Consistent with any limitations or exclusions set forth in these regulations, Federal laws or other governing limitations as to types of cost items;</P>
              <P>(6) Accorded consistent treatment through application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances;</P>
              <P>(7) Provided for in the approved budget/workplan of the State; and</P>
              <P>(8) Consistent with 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.</P>
              <P>(d) A State must submit and FEMA must approve a statement of work before the State receives any grant funds. The statement of work and target allocation of funds are based on a 12-month performance period. Except under extenuating circumstances, the funds initially obligated to the State will be based on the amount of time remaining in the performance period at the time the statement of work is approved.</P>
              <P>(e) States are expected to perform activities and therefore expend funds on a quarterly basis in accordance with the approved statement of work. At the end of the third quarter, State and FEMA regional office staff will review the State's accomplishments to date. Funds not expended in accordance with the approved statement of work by the end of the third quarter of the performance period will not be made available to the State unless the State can demonstrate, and FEMA approves, its ability to perform activities adequately resulting in the expenditure of the funds by the end of the performance period.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 402.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Restricted commodities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The restrictions of Transportation Order T-1 apply to the transportation or discharge of (a) commodities on the Positive List (15 CFR part 399) (as amended from time to time) of the Comprehensive Export Schedule of the Office of International Trade, Department of Commerce, (b) articles on the list of arms, ammunition and implements of war coming within the meaning of Proclamation No. 2776 of March 26, 1948, and (c) commodities, including fissionable materials, controlled for export under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. The restrictions imposed by Transportation Order T-1 do not apply to other commodities, not within these restricted classes at the time of transportation or discharge, even though authorization for the export of the commodity from the United States to the particular destination is required under regulations of the Office of International Trade or under other Federal law or regulation. In this respect, Order T-1 is different from Order T-2 which applies to all commodities destined to Communist China. Order T-1 does not relax or modify any of the requirements of any other regulation or law.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Addition of commodities to the Positive List.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Order T-1 applies to the transportation or discharge of commodities which are restricted at the time of transportation or discharge. Accordingly, if a commodity is added to the Positive List while the commodity is being transported on an American flag ship or aircraft, the restrictions of Order T-1 immediately apply and the commodity may not be transported to or discharged at any of the restricted ports or discharged in transit to one of the restricted ports, unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Calls at restricted ports en route to an unrestricted port with restricted cargo.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Order T-1 does not prohibit an American flag ship or aircraft from going to or calling at one of the restricted ports, even though it has on board a commodity which could not be discharged at that port. (Note, however, that Order T-2 prohibits American flag ships and aircraft from calling at any port or other place in Communist China.) For example, an American flag ship may call at one of the restricted ports (except one in Communist China), even though it has on board the following classes of commodities:</P>
          <P>(a) A Positive List commodity manifested to a destination outside the restricted area, with an export license and an export declaration showing the unrestricted destination at the ultimate destination, (b) a Positive List commodity destined for the restricted port of call which cannot be discharged there because there is no export license or authorization from the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business permitting discharge at the restricted port of call, (c) a commodity of any kind destined for Communist China (the transportation and discharge of which is covered by Order T-2). None of these commodities may be discharged at the restricted port of call. Discharge of any of these commodities at the port covered by the restrictions of Order T-1 is prohibited and subject to penalty, regardless of the circumstances under which the discharge of the cargo at the restricted port occurs, unless appropriate authorization is obtained.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 402.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Forwarding commodities previously shipped.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Order T-1 applies to transportation on or discharge from ships documented under the laws of the United States and aircraft registered under the laws of the United States. These restrictions apply either in the case of a discharge at one of the restricted ports or to discharge at any other port in transit to a restricted destination. The restrictions of Order T-1 do not apply to transportation by foreign carriers, as long as there is no prohibited transportation or discharge by or from a United States flag ship or aircraft after the issuance of Order T-1. Accordingly, if an American flag ship or aircraft, before the issuance of Order T-1, had transported restricted commodities manifested to restricted destinations, and had completed the transportation to a foreign intermediate point and had completed the discharge from the American flag ship or aircraft before the issuance of Order T-1, no violation of that order would have occurred, but Order T-1 would prohibit further shipment on an American flag ship or aircraft unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 402.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Relation to Transportation Order T-2.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Transportation Order T-1 applies to the transportation of commodities to, or in transit to, destinations in Sub-Group A, Hong Kong or Macao. It applies, however, only to commodities on the Positive List of the Office of International Trade, arms and ammunition, and commodities controlled under the Atomic Energy Act (see section 2 of this interpretation). Transportation Order T-2 applies to the transportation of commodities of any kind which are destined to Communist China (Order T-2 also prohibits American ships and aircraft from calling at any port or place in Communist China). Since Communist China is in Sub-Group A, the restrictions of both orders apply to the transportation of commodities to Communist China or to any other point in transit to Communist China.</P>
