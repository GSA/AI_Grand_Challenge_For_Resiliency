      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(10) Specifically concern the Board's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Board of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) Any Board meeting or portion thereof, which may be closed, or any information which may be withheld under paragraph (a) of this section, will not be closed or withheld, respectively, in any case where the Board finds the public interest requires otherwise.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Concurrent Bank and RUS cost-of-money loans.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Bank makes loans, under section 408 of the Act, concurrently with RUS cost-of-money loans made under section 305(d)(2) of the Act. To qualify for concurrent Bank and RUS cost-of-money loans on or after November 1, 1993, a borrower must meet each of the following requirements:</P>

            <P>(1) The average number of proposed subscribers per mile of line in the service area of the borrower is not more than 15, or the borrower has a projected TIER (including the proposed loans) of <PRTPAGE P="12"/>at least 1.0, but not greater than 5.0, as determined by the feasibility study prepared in connection with the loans, see 7 CFR part 1737, subpart H; and</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator of RUS has approved and the borrower is participating in a telecommunications modernization plan for the state, see 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B.</P>
            <P>(b) The loan amounts from each program (Bank, including amounts for class B stock, and RUS cost-of-money) will be proportionate to the total amount of funds appropriated for the fiscal year for Bank loans and RUS cost-of-money loans. To determine the Bank portion, the total loan amount will be multiplied by the ratio of Bank funds appropriated for the fiscal year to the sum of RUS cost-of-money and Bank funds appropriated for the fiscal year in which the loan is approved. The same method would be used to calculate the RUS cost-of-money portion (see 7 CFR 1735.31(b)). If during the fiscal year the amount of funds appropriated changes, the ratio will be adjusted accordingly and applied only to those loans approved afterwards.</P>
            <P>(c) The actual rate of interest on the Bank loan shall be determined as provided in § 1610.10; the RUS cost-of-money loan shall bear interest at a rate equal to the current cost of money to the Federal Government, on the date of advance of funds to the borrower, for loans of similar maturity, but not more than 7 percent per year (see 7 CFR 1735.31(c)).</P>

            <P>(d) Generally, no more than 10 percent of lending authority from appropriations in any fiscal year for Bank and RUS cost-of-money loans may be loaned to a single borrower. The Bank will publish by notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the dollar limit that may be loaned to a single borrower in that particular fiscal year based on approved Bank and RUS lending authority.</P>

            <P>In the interest of making optimum use of the Bank's loan funds, a Bank loan for the acquisition of exchange facilities under section 408(a)(2) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 948(a)(2)) will not be recommended by the Governor for approval by the Secretary of Agriculture unless the Governor determines that the acquisition is reasonably necessary to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, or financial stability of the borrower's telephone system, that the location and character of the proposed acquisition are such that the acquisition is reasonably necessary to accomplish such improvement, and that the amount of the requested loan for such acquisition is reasonably justified by the nature and scope of the improvement which the acquisition would effect.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of interest rate on Bank loans.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All loan fund advances made on or after December 22, 1987 under Bank loans approved on or after October 1, 1987, shall bear interest at the rate determined as established below, but not less than 5 percent per annum.</P>
            <P>(b) The interest rate for the period beginning on the date the advance is made and ending at the close of the fiscal year in which the advance is made shall be the average yield on the date of advance on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a final maturity comparable to the final maturity of the advance. The interest rate shall be determined to the nearest 0.01 percent.</P>

            <P>(1) For this determination, the Bank will use yields on actively traded Treasury issues adjusted to constant maturities obtained from the <E T="03">Federal Reserve statistical release</E> (“Treasury rate”). In accordance with standard Treasury procedures, the rate in effect for any given day is the rate set at the close of business on the preceding day. The 30-year Treasury rate will be applied to all advances with a final maturity of at least 30 years from date of advance. A straight-line interpolation between other Treasury rates will be used to determine the rate applicable for advances with final maturities of less than 30 years.</P>
            <P>(2) The Bank will notify the borrower in writing of the interest rate that applies to each advance.</P>
            <P>(c) After the fiscal year in which the advance is made, the interest rate applied to the advance will be the sum of the calculations made in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section. This interest rate determination shall be made by the Governor within 30 days of the end of each fiscal year and shall be determined to the nearest 0.01 percent.</P>
            <P>(1) The aggregate of all amounts received by the Bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of Class A stock, multiplied by the rate of return payable by the Bank during the fiscal year as specified in section 406(c) of the Act, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank during the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(2) The aggregate of all amounts received by the Bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of Class B stock, multiplied by the rate at which dividends are payable by the Bank during the fiscal year as specified in section 406(d) of the Act, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank during the fiscal year. Section 406(d) provides that “No dividends shall be payable on Class B stock.” The “amounts received by the Bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of Class B stock” means the amount of cash received during the fiscal year for the purchase of Class B stock, plus the amount advanced to borrowers by the Bank during the fiscal year for such purchases, less any Class B stock that is rescinded during the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(3) The aggregate of all amounts received by the Bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of Class C stock, multiplied by the rate at which dividends are payable by the Bank during the fiscal year as specified in section 406(e) of the Act, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank during the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(4) The amounts received by the Bank during the fiscal year from each issue of telephone debentures and other obligations of the Bank, multiplied, respectively, by the rates at which interest is payable by the Bank during the fiscal year to holders of each issue, each of which product is divided, respectively, by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank during the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(5) The amount by which the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank during the fiscal year exceeds the aggregate of the amount received by the Bank from the issuance of Class A stock, Class B stock, Class C stock, and telephone debentures and other obligations of the Bank during the fiscal year, multiplied by the historic cost of money rate as of the close of the immediately preceding fiscal year, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank during the fiscal year.</P>

            <P>(6) As used in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the term “historic cost of money rate as of the close of the immediately preceding fiscal year,” means the sums of the results of the following <PRTPAGE P="14"/>calculations: The amounts advanced by the Bank in each fiscal year during the period beginning with fiscal year 1974 and ending with the immediately preceding fiscal year, multiplied, respectively, by the cost of money rate for the fiscal year (as set forth in Table I for fiscal years 1974 through 1987, and as determined by the Governor in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section for fiscal years after fiscal year 1987), with each product then divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the Bank from the beginning of fiscal year 1974 through the end of the fiscal year just ended.</P>

            </GPOTABLE>
            <P>(d) A borrower with a Bank loan approved on or after October 1, 1987, and before December 22, 1987, and with funds not fully advanced as of December 22, 1987, may until the next advance under the loan or March 21, 1988, whichever is later, elect to have the interest rate specified in the loan commitment apply to the unadvanced portion in lieu of the rate which would otherwise apply as set forth in § 1610.10(a). A borrower making such an election shall contact, in writing, the applicable Area Office of RUS. The Governor shall then adjust the interest rate that applies to the unadvanced portion of the loan accordingly.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Bank, pursuant to section 407(b) of the Act, issues telephone debentures to refinance outstanding telephone debentures or other obligations, the Bank shall reduce the interest rate charged on each advance of Bank loan funds made during the fiscal year(s) in which the refinanced debentures or other obligations were originally issued. The reduction shall be for the period beginning on the issue date of the refinancing debentures and ending on the date the advance matures or is completely prepaid, whichever is earlier. This reduction shall be in addition to any other interest rate reduction required by section 408(b)(3) of the Act. The interest rate shall be reduced by the amount which fully reflects that percentage of the funds saved by the Bank as a result of the refinancing which is equal to the percentage representation of the advance of all advances made during the fiscal year(s) involved. In no case, however, shall the interest rate be reduced to less than 5 percent per annum. The interest rate reduction for each advance shall be determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The funds saved by the Bank as a result of the refinancing shall be computed.</P>
            <P>(2) The advance shall be divided by the total of all advances made during the fiscal year(s) involved, and stated to the nearest .01 percent.</P>
            <P>(3) The percentage in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is multiplied by the amount in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to determine the savings for a particular advance. The interest rate on that advance is then reduced to fully reflect the savings over the remaining amortization period of the loan from which the advance was made.</P>
            <P>(f) Within 60 days after the issue date described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Governor shall amend the loan documentation for each advance described in paragraph (e) of this section, as necessary, to reflect any interest rate reduction applicable to the advance by reason of paragraph (e) of this section, and shall notify each affected borrower of the reduction.</P>
            <P>(g) Within 5 days of determining the cost of money rate for a fiscal year, the Governor shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Cause the determination to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with section 552 of title 5, United States Code, and</P>
            <P>(2) Furnish a copy of the determination to the Comptroller General of the United States.</P>

            <P>(h) A borrower should not wait until the end of the fiscal year to submit a <PRTPAGE P="15"/>requisition for an advance of loan funds if it wants the advance made in that fiscal year. Borrower requisitions submitted late in the fiscal year may not be processed in that fiscal year because of workload and other factors.</P>

            <P>(c) Borrowers that qualify to issue a refunding note or notes in accordance with 7 CFR 1735.43, Payments on loans, shall not be required to pay a prepayment premium on all payments made in accordance with the new payment schedule.</P>

              <P>(a) The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was established by Executive Order No. 7037 on May 11, 1935. Statutory authority was provided by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) (7 U.S.C. 901). The RE Act established REA as a lending agency with responsibility for developing a program for rural electrification.</P>
              <P>(b) On October 28, 1949, the RE Act was amended to authorize REA to make loans to improve and extend telephone service in rural areas. The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB), an agency of the United States, was established by amendment to the RE Act, approved May 7, 1971. The Administrator of RUS serves as the Bank's chief executive with the title of Governor.</P>

              <P>(c) The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) established the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) on October 20, 1994, pursuant to the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, (7 U.S.C. 6941 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). RUS was assigned responsibility for administering electric and telecommunications loan and loan guarantee programs previously administered by REA, including programs of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB), and water and waste loans and grants previously administered by the Rural Development Administration, along with other functions as the Secretary determined appropriate. The rights, interests, obligations, duties, and contracts previously vested in REA were transferred to, and vested in RUS.</P>

A waiver of non-duplication restrictions will not be given if the Administrator determines as a matter of financial feasibility that, taking into account all existing service providers, an applicant or RUS borrower would not be able to repay a loan or successfully implement a grant agreement. Requests for waivers of non-duplication restrictions will be reviewed by taking the following factors into consideration:</P>
              <P>(1) The size, extent and demographics of the duplicative area;</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of service from existing service providers;</P>
              <P>(3) The quality of available service; and</P>
              <P>(4) The ability of the existing service provider to serve the eligible service area.</P>
              <P>(c) Requests for waivers of matching fund requirements will be evaluated by taking the following factors into consideration:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether waivers or reductions in matching or equity requirements would make an otherwise financially infeasible project financially feasible;</P>
              <P>(2) Whether permitting a matching requirement to be met with sources not otherwise permitted in an affected program due to regulatory prohibition may be allowed under a separate statutory authority; and</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the application could be ranked and scored as if the matching requirements were fully met.</P>
              <P>(d) Requests for waivers of credit support requirements will be evaluated taking the following factors into consideration:</P>
              <P>(1) The cost and availability of credit support relative to the loan security derived from such support;</P>

              <P>(2) The extent to which the requirement is shown to be a barrier to the applicant's participation in the program; and<PRTPAGE P="28"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The alternatives to waiving the requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator may adapt the manner of assigning highest funding priority to align with the selection methods used for particular programs or funding opportunities.</P>
              <P>(1) Eligible programs which use priority point scoring may, in a notice of funds availability or similar notice, assign extra points for SUTA eligible applicants as a means to exercise a discretionary authority under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may announce a competitive grant opportunity focused exclusively or primarily on trust lands which incorporates one or more discretionary authorities under this subpart into the rules or scoring for the competition.</P>

              <P>The deferment of loan payments may be granted to any borrower that is not financially distressed, delinquent on any Federal debt, or in bankruptcy proceedings. However, the deferment of loan payments will not be granted to a borrower during any period in which the Administrator has determined that no additional financial assistance of any nature should be provided to the borrower pursuant to any provision of the RE Act. The determination to suspend eligibility for the deferment of loan payments under this subpart will be based on:</P>
              <P>(a) The borrower's demonstrated unwillingness to exercise diligence in repaying loans made by RUS or RTB or guaranteed by RUS that results in the Administrator being unable to find that such loans, would be repaid within the time agreed; or</P>

              <P>(a) The deferment must not impair the security of any loans made RUS or RTB, or guaranteed by RUS, pursuant to the RE Act.</P>
              <P>(b) At no point in time may the amount of the debt service payments deferred exceed 50 percent of the total cost of a community, business, or economic development project for which a deferment is provided.</P>
              <P>(c) A borrower may defer debt service payments only in an amount equal to the investment made by such borrower in a rural development project. The investment must not be made from:</P>

              <P>(1) Proceeds of loans made or guaranteed pursuant to the RE Act, or grants made pursuant to the RE Act or section 2331 through section 2335A of the Rural Economic Development Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 950aaa <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

              <P>(d) Any investment made in a rural development project prior to the date of the application for a deferment based on such project cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for deferment of loan payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the borrower must make a cushion of credit payment equal to the amount of the payment deferred and subject to the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Cushion of credit payments made prior to the date that an application for deferral has been approved by RUS cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) Once a cushion of credit payment has been made to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, it must remain on deposit in the cushion of credit account on the date of the deferral or the deferral will not take place; and</P>
              <P>(3) The cushion of credit payment must be received by RUS on the date the payment being deferred is due, or within 30 days prior to this date.</P>
              <P>(b) A borrower may elect to consolidate in one application filed pursuant to § 1703.311, all of the related deferrals it wishes to receive in a twelve month period following application approval. In such a case, the requirement contained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may alternatively be satisfied by depositing an amount equal to the aggregate deferrals covered by such application into the cushion of credit account at the time the first cushion of credit payment is due under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible communities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An eligible community under this program is one in which the average home energy costs exceed 275 percent of the national average under one or more high energy cost benchmarks established by RUS based on the latest available residential energy information from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the United States Department of Energy. RUS will update the national and high energy cost community benchmarks periodically to incorporate any changes in national home energy costs reported by EIA. RUS will publish the high energy cost community benchmark criteria in the grant announcement. Community eligibility will be determined by RUS at the time of application based on the criteria published in the applicable grant announcement.</P>
              <P>(b) The Application must include information demonstrating that each community in the grant's proposed target area exceeds one or more of the RUS high energy cost community benchmarks to be eligible for assistance under this program. The smallest area that may be designated as a target area is a Census block according to the most recent decennial Census of the United States (decennial Census).</P>
              <P>(c) The target community may include an extremely high cost to serve portion of a larger service area that does not otherwise meet the criteria, provided that the applicant can establish that the costs to serve the smaller target area exceed the benchmark.</P>

              <P>(d) In determining the community energy costs, applicants may include additional revenue sources that lower the rates or out of pocket consumer energy costs such as rate averaging, and other Federal, State, or private cost contributions or subsidies.<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) The applicant may propose a project that will serve high energy cost communities across a State or region, but where individual project beneficiaries will be selected at a later time. In such cases, to establish eligibility, the applicant must provide sufficient information in the application to determine that the proposed target area includes eligible high energy cost communities and proposed selection criteria to assure that grant funds are used to serve eligible communities.</P>

Budgets will be reviewed for completeness and the strength of non-Federal funding commitments. Points may not be awarded unless sufficient detail is provided to determine whether or not funds are being used for qualified purposes. Reviewers will consider the adequacy of the applicant's budget and resources to carry out the project as proposed. Reviewers will also evaluate how the applicant proposes to manage available resources such as grant funds, income generated from the facilities and any other financing sources to maintain and operate a financially viable project once the grant period has ended. Reviewers must make a finding of operational sustainability for any points to be awarded. Projects for which future grant funding is likely to be required in order to assure ongoing operations will not receive any points.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Demonstrated experience.</E> Reviewers will consider whether the applicant or its project team have demonstrated experience in successfully administering and carrying out projects that are comparable to that proposed in the application. The reviewers may assign a higher point score to proposals that develop the internal capacity to provide or improve energy services in the eligible communities over other proposals that rely extensively on temporary outside contractors.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Community needs.</E> Reviewers will consider the applicant's assessment of community energy needs to be addressed by the proposed project as well <PRTPAGE P="47"/>as the severity of physical and economic challenges affecting the target communities. In determining whether one proposal should receive more points than another under this criterion, reviewers will consider the relative burdens placed on the communities and individual households by extremely high energy costs, the hardships created by limited access to reliable and affordable energy services and the availability of other resources to support or supplement the proposed grant funding.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Project evaluation and performance measures.</E> Reviewers will consider the applicant's suggested project evaluation and performance criteria. Reviewers may award higher points to criteria that are quantifiable, directly relevant to project goals, and reflect serious consideration than to more subjective performance criteria that do not incorporate variables that reflect a reduction in energy cost or improvement in service.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Coordination with rural development initiatives.</E> Proposals that include documentation confirming coordination with State rural development initiatives may be credited points for this criterion.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Priority considerations.</E> Subject to the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, evaluation points may also be awarded for projects that advance identified priority interests identified in the grant announcement to assist the Agency in selecting among competing projects when the amount of funding requests exceed available funds. The grant announcement may incorporate all or some of the priority criteria listed below, and as discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, the grant announcement may supplement these criteria. The announcement will also specify the points that will be awarded to qualifying applications under these priority criteria.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Community economic hardship.</E> Economic hardship points may be awarded where the median household income for the target community is significantly below the State average or where the target community suffers from economic conditions that severely constrain its ability to provide or improve energy facilities serving the community. Applicants must describe in detail and document conditions creating severe community economic hardship in the proposal.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rurality.</E> Priority consideration may be given to proposals that serve smaller rural communities. Applications will be scored based on the population of the largest incorporated cities, towns or villages or census designated places included within the grant's proposed target area as determined using the population figures from the most recent decennial Census. If the applicable population figure cannot be based on the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Unserved energy needs.</E> Points may be awarded to projects that extend or improve electric or other energy services to eligible communities or areas of eligible communities that do not have reliable centralized or commercial service.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Imminent hazard.</E> Additional points may be awarded for projects that correct a condition posing an imminent hazard to public safety, public welfare, the environment, or to a critical community or residential energy facility in immediate danger of failure because of a deteriorated condition, capacity limitation, or damage from a natural disaster or accident.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Cost sharing.</E> Projects that evidence significant commitments of funds, contributed property, equipment, or other in kind support for the project may be awarded additional points for this criterion where the aggregate value of these contributions exceed ten percent of total eligible project costs.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applications.</E> The Agency will solicit applications on a competitive basis by publication of a grant announcement establishing the amount of funds available, the maximum grant award, the required application materials and where to obtain them, the evaluation and selection criteria and <PRTPAGE P="49"/>weights, and application deadlines. Unless otherwise specified in the announcement, applicants must file an original application package and two copies. Where provided in the grant announcement, applicants may submit electronic applications.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Required forms.</E> The grant application will use the Standard Application for Federal Assistance (SF-424 series or its successor) and other forms as provided in the grant announcement. The required forms must be completed, signed and submitted by a person authorized to submit the proposal on behalf of the applicants. Where provided in the grant announcement, applicants may file electronic versions of the forms in compliance with the instructions in the grant announcement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Narrative proposal and required elements.</E> Each grant application must include a narrative proposal describing the project and addressing the following elements. The form, contents, and order of the narrative proposal will be specified in the grant announcement. Additional elements may be published in the applicable grant announcement.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Executive summary.</E> This summary of the proposal must identify the State entity applying for the grant and the key agency contact information (telephone and fax numbers, mailing address and e-mail address). The applicant must clearly state the amount requested in this section. It should briefly describe the program, including the estimated number of potential beneficiaries in eligible areas, their estimated fuel needs, the projects and activities to be financed through the revolving fund and how the projects and activities will improve the cost effectiveness of fuel procured.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicant eligibility.</E> The application must establish that the applicant is a State entity that was in existence as of November 9, 2000, and has the legal authority to enter into a financial assistance relationship with the Federal Government to carry out the grant activities.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Assessment of needs and potential beneficiaries.</E> The application must provide estimates of the number, location and population of potentially eligible areas in the State and their estimated fuel needs and costs. The section must also describe the criteria used to identify eligible areas, including the characteristics that make fuel deliveries by surface transport impossible or impracticable. The description of beneficiary communities should provide a detailed breakdown of the density profile of the area to be served by eligible projects.

The general and pre-loan policies and procedures for municipal rate electric loans made by RUS may be found in this part and 7 CFR part 1714. Treasury rate electric loans are also governed by such municipal rate policies and procedures, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Interest rates.</E> The standard interest rate on direct Treasury rate loans will be established daily by the United States Treasury. The borrower will select interest rate terms for each advance of funds. The minimum interest rate term shall be one year. Interest rate terms will be limited to terms published by the Treasury (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30). Interest rate terms to final maturity date, if other than published by Treasury, will be determined by RUS. Interest rates for terms greater than 30 years will be at the 30-year rate. There will be no interest rate cap on Treasury rate loans.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prepayment.</E> A Treasury rate direct electric loan may be repaid at par on its rollover maturity date if there is one. Such a loan, or portion thereof, may also be prepaid after it has been advanced for not less than two years, at any time prior to its rollover or final maturity date at its “net present value” (NPV) as determined by RUS.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Supplemental financing.</E> Supplemental financing will not be required in connection with Treasury rate direct electric loans.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan documents.</E> Successful applicants will be required to execute and deliver to RUS a promissory note evidencing the borrower's obligation to repay the loan. The note must be in form and substance satisfactory to RUS. RUS will require a form of note substantially in the form that it currently accepts for direct municipal rate electric loans, with such revisions as may be necessary or appropriate to reflect the different interest setting provisions and the terms of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. All notes will be secured in accordance with the terms of 7 CFR part 1718.</P>

              <P>(a) RUS makes loans to corporations, states, territories, and subdivisions and agencies thereof; municipalities; people's utility districts; and cooperative, nonprofit, limited-dividend, or mutual associations that provide or propose to provide:</P>
              <P>(1) The retail electric service needs of rural areas, or</P>
              <P>(2) The power supply needs of distribution borrowers under the terms of power supply arrangements satisfactory to RUS.</P>
              <P>(b) In making loans, RUS gives preference to states, territories, and subdivisions and agencies thereof; municipalities; people's utility districts; and cooperative, nonprofit, or limited-dividend associations. RUS does not make direct loans to individual consumers.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining eligibility of a distribution borrower not in default on the repayment of a loan made or guaranteed under the RE Act for a loan, loan guarantee, or lien accommodation, a default by a borrower from which a distribution borrower purchases wholesale power shall not:</P>
              <P>(1) Be considered a default by the distribution borrower;</P>
              <P>(2) Reduce the eligibility of the distribution borrower for assistance under the RE Act; or</P>
              <P>(3) Be the cause, directly or indirectly, of imposing any requirement or restriction on the borrower as a condition of the assistance, except such requirements or restrictions as are necessary to implement a debt restructuring agreed on by the power supply borrower and RUS.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of determining the eligibility of a distribution borrower, RUS will consider whether the distribution borrower is current on its obligations to its wholesale power supplier under the RUS wholesale power contract.</P>
              <P>(e) Nothing in paragraph (c) of this section relieves any distribution borrower that is a member of a power supply borrower in default on its obligations to RUS or operating under a debt restructuring agreement, of requirements set forth in RUS regulations, including, without limitation, § 1710.112(b)(6), or of any terms and conditions that the Administrator may otherwise impose on any borrower as a condition of obtaining a loan or loan guarantee (including, in appropriate cases, member guarantees).</P>
              <P>(f) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, former borrowers that have paid off all outstanding loans may reapply for a loan to serve RE Act beneficiary loads accruing from the time the former borrower's complete loan application is received by RUS. The determination of whether an area is rural will be based on the Census designation of the area at the time of the reapplication for a loan, if the area is not served by electric facilities financed by RUS. If the area is served by electric facilities financed by RUS, it will continue to be considered rural.</P>
              <P>(g) Former borrowers that have prepaid all, or portions of outstanding insured and direct loans in accordance with RUS regulations must comply with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1786 before being considered eligible to borrow additional funds from RUS.</P>

If a borrower applies for a section 306 loan guarantee to finance all or a portion of distribution and subtransmission facilities, such request will not affect the borrower's eligibility for an insured loan to finance any remaining portion of said facilities or for any future insured loan to finance other distribution or subtransmission facilities.

              <P>(d) A distribution borrower may request a loan period of up to 4 years. Except in the case of loans for new generating and associated transmission facilities, a power supply borrower may request a loan period of not more than 4 years for transmission and substation facilities and improvements or replacements of generation facilities. The loan period for new generating facilities and DSM activities will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Administrator may approve a loan period shorter than the period requested by the borrower, if in the Administrator's sole discretion, a loan made for the longer period would fail to meet RUS requirements for loan feasibility and loan security set forth in §§ 1710.112 and 1710.113, respectively.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the amount authorized for lending for municipal rate loans, hardship rate loans, and loan guarantees in a fiscal year is substantially less than the total amount eligible for RUS financing, RUS may limit the size of all loans of that type approved during the fiscal year. Depending on the amount of the shortfall between the amount authorized for lending and the loan application inventory on hand for each type of loan, RUS may either reduce the amount on an equal proportion basis for all applicants for that type of loan based on the amount of funds for which the applicant is eligible, or may shorten the loan period for which funding will be approved to less than the maximum of 4 years. All applications for the same type of loan approved during a fiscal year will be treated in the same manner, except that RUS will not limit funding to any borrower requesting an RUS loan or loan guarantee of $1 million or less.</P>
              <P>(2) If RUS limits the amount of loan funds approved for borrowers, the Administrator shall notify all electric borrowers early in the fiscal year of the manner in which funding will be limited. The portion of the loan application that is not funded during that fiscal year may, at the borrower's option, be treated as a second loan application received by RUS at a later date. This date will be determined by RUS in the same manner for all affected loans and will be based on the availability of loan funds. The second loan application shall be considered complete except that the borrower must submit a certification from a duly authorized corporate official stating that funds are still needed for loan purposes specified in the original application and must notify RUS of any changes in its circumstances that materially affects the information contained in the original loan application or the primary support documents.

Each advance will be charged to the oldest outstanding note(s) having unadvanced funds for the primary budget purpose for which the request for advances was made, regardless of whether such notes are associated with loans approved before or after October 1, 1991, unless any conditions on advances under any of these notes have not been met by the borrower.</P>

Such reimbursement and/or replacement of interim financing may include the direct costs of procurement and construction, as well as the related cost of engineering, architectural, environmental and other studies and plans needed to support the project, when such cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the facilities.</P>
              <P>(b) If procurement and/or construction of the equipment and facilities was completed prior to the current loan period, reimbursement, including replacement of interim financing, will be limited, except in cases of extreme financial hardship as determined by the Administrator, to the cost of procurement and construction completed during the period immediately preceding the current loan period, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

RUS will normally grant a lien accommodation to the supplemental lender. RUS does not require supplemental financing in conjunction with an RUS guaranteed loan. However, if a borrower elects to obtain supplemental financing in conjunction with a guaranteed loan, the granting of RUS's loan guarantee may be conditioned on the borrower's obtaining supplemental financing.</P>
              <P>(b) The terms and conditions of supplemental financing and any security offered to the supplemental lender are subject to RUS approval. Generally, supplemental loans must have the same final maturity and be amortized in the same manner as RUS loans made concurrently. Borrowers may elect to repay the loans either in substantially equal periodic installments covering interest and principal, or in periodic installments that include interest and level amortization of principal.</P>

If one of the merging parties met the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section prior to the effective date of the merger consolidation or transfer, the borrower will be required to obtain supplemental financing equal to 10 percent of any loan funds requested for facilities to serve consumers located in the territory formerly served by the “paragraph (c)(1)(i)” borrower.

The borrower must provide evidence satisfactory to the Administrator that the loan will be repaid in full as scheduled, and that all other obligations of the borrower will be met.</P>
              <P>(b) Based on evidence submitted by the borrower and other information, RUS will use the following criteria to evaluate loan feasibility:</P>
              <P>(1) Projections of power requirements, rates, revenues, expenses, margins, and other factors for the present system and proposed additions are based on reasonable assumptions and adequate supporting data and analysis, including analysis of a range of assumptions for the significant variables, when required by § 1710.300(d)(5).</P>
              <P>(2) Projected revenues from the rates proposed by the borrower are adequate to meet the required TIER and DSC ratios based on the borrower's total costs, including the projected maximum debt service cost of the new loan.</P>

              <P>(3) The economics of the borrower's operations and service area are such that consumers can reasonably be expected to pay the proposed rates required to cover all expenses and meet RUS TIER and DSC requirements, and <PRTPAGE P="68"/>the borrower can reasonably compete with other utilities and other energy sources to prevent substantial load loss while providing satisfactory service to its consumers.</P>
              <P>(4) Risks of possible loss of substantial loads from large consumers or from load concentrations in particular industries will not substantially impair loan feasibility.</P>
              <P>(5) Risks of loss of portions of the borrower's service territory from annexation or other causes will not substantially impair loan feasibility. If there appears to be a substantial risk, RUS may require additional information from the borrower, such as a summary and analysis of the risk by the borrower; state, county or local planning reports having information on projected growth or expansion plans of local communities; annexation plans of the municipalities in question; and any other relevant information.</P>
              <P>(6) In states where rates or investment decisions are subject to approval by state regulatory authorities, there is reasonable expectation that such approvals will be forthcoming to enable repayment of the loan in full according to its terms.</P>
              <P>(7) The experience and performance of the system's management is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(8) In the case of joint ventures, the borrower has sufficient management control or other contractual safeguards with respect to the construction and operation of the jointly owned facility to ensure that the borrower's interests are protected and the credit risk is minimized.</P>
              <P>(9) The borrower has implemented adequate financial and management controls and there are and have been no significant financial or other irregularities.</P>
              <P>(10) The borrower's projected capitalization, measured by its equity as a percentage of total assets, is adequate to enable the borrower to meet its financial needs and to provide service consistent with the RE Act. Among the factors to be considered in reviewing the borrower's projected capitalization are the economic strength of the borrower's service territory, the inherent cost of providing service to the territory, the disparity in rates between the borrower and neighboring utilities, the intensity of competition faced by the borrower from neighboring utilities and other power sources, and the relative amount of new capital investment required to serve existing or new loads.</P>

Rates must be designed and implemented to produce at least enough revenue to meet the requirements of this paragraph under the assumption that average weather conditions in the borrower's service territory will prevail in the future, including average system damage and outages due to weather and the related costs. Failure to design and implement rates pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph shall be an event of default upon notice provided in accordance with the terms of the borrower's mortgage or loan contract.</P>

If a borrower fails to achieve these average levels, it must promptly notify RUS in writing. Within 30 days of such notification or of the borrower being notified in writing by RUS, whichever is earlier, the borrower, in consultation with RUS, must provide a written plan satisfactory to RUS setting forth the actions that will be taken to achieve the required coverage ratios on a timely basis. Failure to develop and implement a plan satisfactory to RUS shall be an event of default upon notice provided in accordance with the terms of the borrower's mortgage or loan contract.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirements for advance of funds.</E> (1) If a borrower applying for a loan has failed to achieve the coverage ratios required by paragraph (b) of this section during the latest 12 month period immediately preceding approval of the loan, or if any of the borrower's average coverage ratios for the 2 best years out of the most recent 3 calendar years were below the levels required in paragraph (b) of this section, RUS may withhold the advance of loan funds until the borrower has adopted an annual financial plan and operating budget satisfactory to RUS and taken such other action as RUS may require to demonstrate that the required coverage ratios will be maintained in the future and that the loan will be repaid with interest within the time agreed. Such other action may include, for example, increasing system operating efficiency and reducing costs or adopting a rate design that will achieve the required coverage ratios, and either placing such rates into effect or taking action to obtain regulatory authority approval of such rates. If failure to achieve the coverage ratios is due to unusual events beyond the control of the borrower, such as unusual weather, system outage due to a storm or regulatory delay in approving rate increases, then the Administrator may waive the requirement that the borrower take the remedial actions set forth in this paragraph, provided that such waiver will not threaten loan feasibility.</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to any outstanding loan approved by RUS on or after February 10, 1992, if, based on actual or projected financial performance of the borrower, RUS determines that the borrower may not achieve its required coverage ratios in the current or future years, RUS may withhold the advance of loan funds until the borrower has taken remedial action satisfactory to RUS.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Final maturity.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) RUS is authorized to make loans and loan guarantees with a final maturity of up to 35 years. The borrower may elect a repayment period for a loan not longer than the expected useful life of the facilities, not to exceed 35 years. Most of the electric facilities financed by RUS have a long useful life, often approximating 35 years. Some facilities, such as load management equipment and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition equipment, <PRTPAGE P="71"/>have a much shorter useful life due, in part, to obsolescence. Operating loans to finance working capital required for the initial operation of a new system are a separate class of loans and usually have a final maturity of less than 10 years.</P>
              <P>(b) Loans made or guaranteed by RUS for facilities owned by the borrower generally must be repaid with interest within a period, up to 35 years, that approximates the expected useful life of the facilities financed. The expected useful life shall be based on the weighted average of the useful lives that the borrower proposes for the facilities financed by the loan, provided that the proposed useful lives are deemed appropriate by RUS. RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application must include, as a note, either a statement certifying that at least 90 percent of the loan funds are for facilities that have a useful life of 33 years or longer, or a schedule showing the costs and useful life of those facilities with a useful life of less than 33 years. If the useful life determination proposed by the borrower is not deemed appropriate by RUS, RUS will base expected useful life on an independent evaluation, the manufacturer's estimated useful-life or RUS experience with like-property, as applicable. Final maturities for loans for the implementation of programs for demand side management and energy resource conservation and on and off grid renewable energy sources not owned by the borrower will be determined by RUS. Due to the uncertainty of predictions over an extended period of time, RUS may add up to 2 years to the composite average useful life of the facilities in order to determine final maturity.</P>
              <P>(c) The term for loans made to finance Eligible EE Programs will be determined in accordance with § 1710.408 of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) The Administrator may approve a repayment period longer than the expected useful life of the facilities financed, up to 35 years, if a longer final maturity is required to ensure repayment of the loan and loan security is adequate.</P>
              <P>(e) The final maturity of a loan established pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be extended as a result of extending loan payments under section 12(a) of the RE Act.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Interim financing.</E> For loans that include funds to replace interim financing, there is satisfactory evidence that the interim financing was used for purposes approved by RUS and that the loan meets all applicable requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Facilities for nonrural areas.</E> Whenever a borrower proposes to use loan funds for the improvement, expansion, construction, or acquisition of electric facilities for non-RE Act beneficiaries, there is satisfactory evidence that such funds are necessary and incidental to furnishing or improving electric service for RE Act beneficiaries. See § 1710.104.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Facilities to be included in rate base.</E> In states having jurisdiction, the borrower has provided satisfactory evidence based on the information available, such as an opinion of counsel, that the state regulatory authority will not exclude from the borrower's rate base any of the facilities included in the loan request, or otherwise prevent the borrower from charging rates sufficient to repay with interest the debt incurred for the facilities. Such evidence may be based on, but not necessarily limited to, the provisions of applicable state laws; the rules and policies of the state authority; precedents in other similar cases; statements made by the state authority; any assurances given to the borrower by the state authority; and other relevant information and experience.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Construction work plan (CWP).</E> The CWP shall specify and document the capital investments required to serve a borrower's planned new loads, improve service reliability and quality, and service the changing needs of existing loads. The requirements for a CWP are set forth in subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Long-range financial forecasts.</E> RUS encourages borrowers to maintain on a current basis a long-range financial forecast, which should be used by a borrower's board of directors and manager to guide the system toward its financial goals. The forecast submitted in support of a loan application shall show the projected results of future actions planned by the board of directors. The requirements for a long-range financial forecast are set forth in subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental review requirements.</E> A borrower must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>

              <P>This subpart contains RUS policies for the preparation, review, approval and use of load forecasts and load forecast work plans. A load forecast is a thorough study of a borrower's electric loads and the factors that affect those loads in order to estimate, as accurately as practicable, the borrower's future requirements for energy and capacity. The load forecast of a power supply borrower includes and integrates the load forecasts of its member systems. An approved load forecast, if required by this subpart, is one of the primary documents that a borrower is required to submit to support a loan application.</P>

RUS borrowers that are members of a power supply borrower with a total utility plant of $500 million or more must cooperate in the preparation of and submittal of the load forecast work plan of their power supply borrower.</P>
              <P>(b) A load forecast work plan establishes the process for the preparation and maintenance of a comprehensive database for the development of the borrower's load forecast, and load forecast updates. The load forecast work plan is intended to develop and maintain a process that will result in load forecasts that will meet the borrowers' own needs and the requirements of this subpart. A work plan represents a commitment by a power supply borrower and its members, or by a large unaffiliated distribution borrower, that all parties concerned will prepare their load forecasts in a timely manner pursuant to the load forecast work plan and they will modify the load forecast work plan as needed to address changing circumstances or enhance the usefulness of the load forecast work plan.</P>
              <P>(c) A load forecast work plan for a power supply borrower and its members must cover all member systems, including those that are not borrowers. However, only members that are borrowers, including the power supply borrower, are required to follow the load forecast work plan in preparing their respective load forecasts. Each borrower is individually responsible for forecasting all its RE Act beneficiary and non-RE Act beneficiary loads.</P>

              <P>(f) Load forecast work plans for borrowers with residential demand of 50 percent or more of total kWh must provide for a residential consumer survey at least every 5 years to obtain data on appliance and equipment saturation and electricity demand. Any such borrower that is experiencing or anticipates changes in usage patterns shall consider surveys on a more frequent schedule. Power supply borrowers shall coordinate such surveys with their members. Residential consumer surveys may be based on the aggregation of member-based samples or on a system-wide sample, provided that the latter provides for relevant regional breakdowns as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(g) Load forecast work plans must provide for RUS review of the load forecasts as the load forecast is being developed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) An ongoing, integrated planning system is needed by borrowers to determine their short-term and long-term needs for plant additions, improvements, replacements, and retirements. <PRTPAGE P="79"/>The primary components of the system consist of long-range engineering plans, construction work plans (CWPs), CWP amendments, and special engineering and cost studies. Long range engineering plans identify plant investments required over a period of 10-20 years or more. CWPs specify and document plant requirements for the short-term, usually 4 years, and special engineering and cost studies are used to support CWPs and to identify and document requirements for specific items or purposes, such as load management equipment, System Control and Data Acquisition equipment, sectionalizing investments, and additions of generation capacity and associated transmission plant.</P>
              <P>(b) A long range engineering plan specifies and supports the major system additions, improvements, replacements, and retirements needed for an orderly transition from the existing system to the system required 10 or more years in the future. The planned future system should be based on the most technically and economically sound means of serving the borrower's long-range loads in a reliable and environmentally acceptable manner, and it should ensure that planned facilities will not become obsolete prematurely.</P>
              <P>(c) A CWP shall include investment cost estimates and supporting engineering and cost studies to demonstrate the need for each proposed facility or activity and the reasonableness of the investment projections and the engineering assumptions used in sizing the facilities. The CWP must be consistent with the borrower's long range engineering plan and both documents must be consistent with the borrower's RUS-approved power requirements study.</P>
              <P>(d) Applications for a loan or loan guarantee from RUS (new loans or budget reclassifications) must be supported by a current CWP approved by RUS. RUS approval of these plans relates only to the facilities, equipment, and other purposes to be financed by RUS, and means that the plans provide an adequate basis from a planning and engineering standpoint to support RUS financing. RUS approval of the plans does not mean that RUS approves of the facilities, equipment, or other purposes for which the borrower is not seeking RUS financing. If RUS disagrees with a borrower's estimate of the cost of one or more facilities for which RUS financing is sought, RUS may adjust the estimate after consulting with the borrower and explaining the reasons for the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, to be eligible for RUS financing, the facilities, including equipment and other items, included in a CWP must be approved by RUS and receive Environmental Clearance before the start of construction. This requirement also applies to any amendments to a CWP required to add facilities to a CWP or to make significant physical changes in the facilities already included in a CWP. Provision for funding of “minor projects” under an RUS loan guarantee is permitted on the same basis as that discussed for insured loan funds in 7 CFR part 1721, Post-Loan Policies and Procedures for Insured Electric Loans.</P>
              <P>(f) In the case of damage caused by storms and other natural catastrophes, a borrower may proceed with emergency repair work before a CWP or CWP amendment is prepared by the borrower and approved by RUS, without losing eligibility for RUS financing of the repairs. The borrower must notify the RUS regional office in writing after the natural catastrophe, of its preliminary estimates of damages and repair costs. Not later than 120 days after the natural catastrophe, the borrower must submit to RUS for approval, a CWP or CWP amendment detailing the repairs.</P>
              <P>(g) A CWP may be amended or augmented when the borrower can demonstrate the need for the changes.</P>
              <P>(h) A borrower's CWP or special engineering studies must be supported by the appropriate level of environmental review documentation, in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>

              <P>(i) All engineering activities required by this subpart must be performed by qualified engineers, who may be staff employees of the borrower or outside consultants. All engineering services must be reviewed by a licensed professional engineer.<PRTPAGE P="80"/>
              </P>
              <P>(j) Upon written request from a borrower, RUS may waive in writing certain requirements with respect to long-range engineering plans and CWPs if RUS determines that such requirements impose a substantial burden on the borrower and that waiving the requirements will not significantly affect the accomplishment of the objectives of this subpart. For example, if a borrower's load is forecast to remain constant or decline during the planning period, RUS may waive those portions of the plans that relate to load growth.</P>

Load management equipment eligible for financing, including the related costs of installation, is limited to capital equipment designed to influence the time and manner of consumer use of electricity, which includes peak clipping and load shifting. To be eligible for financing, such equipment must be owned by the borrower, although it may be located inside or outside a consumer's premises; and</P>
              <P>(12) The cost of engineering, architectural, environmental and other studies and plans needed to support the construction of facilities, when such cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the facilities.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Insured electric loans approved on or after November 1, 1993.</E> On November 1, 1993, the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act, Pub. L. 103-129, 107 Stat. 1356, (RELRA) amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> (RE Act) to establish a new interest rate structure for insured electric loans. Insured electric loans approved on or after this date, are either municipal rate loans or hardship rate loans. Borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in § 1714.8 are eligible for 5 percent hardship rate loans. The interest rate on loans to other borrowers is the municipal interest rate, and borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in § 1714.7 are eligible for the interest rate cap on their municipal rate loans. Interest rates for the initial interest rate term and rollover terms (§ 1714.6) will be determined pursuant to § 1714.4. Provisions for prepayment are set forth in § 1714.9. The provisions of this subpart apply to loans approved on or after November 1, 1993, unless otherwise stated.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Insured electric loans approved prior to November 1, 1993.</E> These loans have a single interest rate applicable to the entire loan. The rate is generally 5 percent, but, in some cases, may be as low as 2 percent. These loans have a single interest rate term and may be prepaid at face value at any time. Provisions for discounted prepayment of these loans are set forth in 7 CFR part 1786.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Municipal rate loans.</E> Each advance of funds on a municipal rate loan shall bear interest at a single rate for each interest rate term. All interest rates applicable to municipal rate loans will be increased by one eighth of one percent (0.125 percent), if the borrower elects to include in the loan agreement a prepayment option (call provision), allowing the borrower to prepay all or a portion of an advance on a date other than a rollover maturity date. However, no interest rate for any advances of a loan to a borrower who qualifies for the interest rate cap may exceed 7 percent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of interest rates on municipal rate loans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) RUS will post on the RUS website, Electric Program HomePage, a schedule of interest rates for municipal rate loans at the beginning of each calendar quarter. The schedule will show the year of maturity and the applicable interest rates in effect for all funds advanced on municipal rate loans during the calendar quarter and all interest rate terms beginning in the quarter. All interest rates will be adjusted to the nearest one eighth of one percent (0.125 percent).</P>
              <P>(b) The rate for interest rate terms of 20 years or longer will be the average of the 20 year rates published in the Bond Buyer in the 4 weeks specified in paragraph (d) of this section for the “11-Bond GO Index” of Aa rated general obligation municipal bonds, or the successor to this index.</P>

              <P>(c) The rate for terms of less than 20 years will be the average of the rates published in the Bond Buyer in the 4 weeks specified in paragraph (d) of this section in the table of “Municipal Market Data—General Obligation Yields” for Aa rated bonds, or the successor to this table, for obligations maturing in <PRTPAGE P="98"/>the same year as the interest rate term selected by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(d) The interest rates on municipal rate loans shall not exceed the interest rate determined under section 307(a)(3)(A) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1927(a)(3)(A)) for Water and Waste Disposal loans. The method used to determine this rate is set forth in the regulations of the Rural Housing Service at 7 CFR 1942.17(f)(1) and (4). Pursuant to the RUS rule, the interest rates are set using as guidance the average of the Bond Buyer Index for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Municipal rate loans.</E> Selection of interest rate terms shall be made by the borrower for each advance of funds. The minimum interest rate term shall be one year. RUS will send the borrower written confirmation of each rollover maturity date and the applicable interest rate.</P>
              <P>(1) The initial interest rate term will begin on the date of the advance. All rollover interest rate terms will begin on the first day of a month, and except for the last interest rate term to final maturity, shall end on the last day of a month. All terms except for the initial interest rate term on an advance, and the last term to final maturity shall be in yearly increments.</P>
              <P>(2) The following limits apply to the number of advances of funds that may be made to the borrower on any municipal rate loan:</P>

              <P>(ii) If the loan period is more than 2 years, not more than 8 advances.</P>
              <P>(3) For the initial interest rate term of an advance, a letter from an authorized official of the borrower indicating the selection of the term shall accompany the request for the advance.</P>
              <P>(4) At the end of any interest rate term, the borrower shall pay all accrued interest and principal balance then due, and either prepay the remaining principal of the advance at face value, or roll over the remaining principal for a new term, provided that no interest rate term may end later than the date of the final maturity.</P>
              <P>(i) If the borrower elects to prepay all or part of the remaining principal of the advance at face value, it must notify the Director of the appropriate Regional Division or the Power Supply Division in writing not later than 20 days before the rollover maturity date.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the borrower wishes to elect a new interest rate term that is different from the term previously selected, it must notify RUS in writing of the new term not later than 20 days before the end of the current term. The election of the new term shall be addressed to the Director, Financial Operations Division, Rural Utilities Service, Washington, DC 20250-1500.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the borrower fails to notify RUS within the timeframes set out in this paragraph of its intention to prepay or elect a different interest rate term, RUS will automatically roll over the remaining principal for the shorter of, and at the interest rate applicable to:</P>
              <P>(A) A period equal in length to the term that is expiring; or</P>
              <P>(B) The remaining period to final maturity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Hardship rate loans.</E> Loans made at the 5 percent hardship rate are made for a single term that cannot exceed the final maturity as set forth in 7 CFR 1710.115. The hardship interest rate applies to the entire amount of the loan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interest rate cap.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the municipal interest rate may not exceed 7 percent on a loan advance to a borrower primarily engaged in providing retail electric service if the borrower meets, at the time of loan approval, either the consumer density test set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, or both the rate disparity test for the interest rate cap and the consumer income test set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Low consumer density test.</E> The borrower meets this test if the average number of consumers per mile of line of its total electric system, based on <PRTPAGE P="99"/>the most recent data available at the time of loan approval is less than 5.50.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Rate disparity test for the interest rate cap.</E> The borrower meets this test if its average revenue per kWh sold is more than the average revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service. To determine whether a borrower meets this test, RUS will compare the borrower's average total revenue with statewide data in the table of Average Revenue per Kilowatthour for Electric Utilities by Sector, Census Division and State, in the Electric Power Annual issued by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE), or the successor to this table. The test will be based on the most recent calendar year for which full year DOE data are available at the time of loan approval and borrower data for the same year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Consumer income test.</E> The borrower meets this test if either the average per capita income of the residents receiving electric service from the borrower is less than the average per capita income of residents of the state in which the borrower provides service or the median household income of the households receiving electric service from the borrower is less than the median household income of the households in the state.</P>
              <P>(i) To qualify under the consumer income test, the borrower must include in its loan application information about the location of its residential consumers. The borrower must provide to RUS, based on the most recent data available at the time of loan application, either the number of consumers in each county it serves or the number of consumers in each census tract it serves. Using 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data, RUS will compare, on a weighted average basis, the average per capita and median household income of the counties or census tracts served by the borrower with state figures.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is reason to believe that the ACS or other Census Bureau data does not accurately represent the economic conditions of the borrower's consumers, the reasons will be documented and the borrower may furnish, or RD may obtain, additional information regarding such economic conditions. Information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, State, or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. The Administrator has the sole discretion to determine whether such data submitted by the borrower is sufficient to determine whether the borrower qualifies under the consumer income test.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Borrowers serving 2 or more states.</E> If a borrower serves consumers in 2 or more states, the rate disparity test and the consumer income test will be determined on a weighted average based on the percentage of the borrower's total consumers that are served in each state.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">High density test.</E> If the average number of consumers per mile of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the interest rate cap will not apply to funds used for the purpose of furnishing or improving electric service to consumers located in an area that is an urban area at the time of loan approval, notwithstanding that the area must have been deemed a rural area for the purpose of qualifying for a loan under this part. (See the definition of “rural area” in 7 CFR 1710.2.) If the average number of consumers per mile of line of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the borrower must include, as a note on RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application for a loan subject to the interest rate cap, a breakdown of funds included in the proposed loan to furnish or improve service to consumers located in such urban areas. For such borrowers only funds for those facilities serving consumers located outside an urban area are eligible for the interest rate cap.</P>

              <P>Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator shall make an insured electric loan for eligible purposes at the 5 percent hardship rate to a borrower primarily engaged in providing retail electric service if the borrower meets, at the time of loan approval, both the rate disparity test <PRTPAGE P="100"/>for hardship and the consumer income test described in paragraph (a) of this section; or the extremely high rates test set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. A loan at the 5 percent hardship rate may also be made to any borrower pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section who, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, has experienced a severe hardship. The Administrator may not require a loan from a supplemental source in connection with a hardship rate loan.</P>
              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Rate disparity test for hardship.</E> The borrower meets this test if its average revenue per kWh sold is not less than 120 percent of the average revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service, and its average residential revenue per kWh is not less than 120 percent of the average residential revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service. To determine whether a borrower meets this test, RUS will compare the borrower's average total revenue and average residential revenue with statewide data in the table of Average Revenue per Kilowatthour for Electric Utilities by Sector, Census Division and State, in the Electric Power Annual issued by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE), or the successor to this table.

RUS will determine whether the borrower qualifies under this test according to the procedure set forth in § 1714.7(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Borrowers serving 2 or more states.</E> If a borrower serves consumers in 2 or more states, the rate disparity test and the consumer income tests will be determined on a weighted average based on the percentage of the borrower's total consumers that are served in each state.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Extremely high rates test.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, the Administrator shall make an insured electric loan at the 5 percent hardship rate to any borrower whose residential revenue exceeds 15.0 cents per kWh sold. Residential revenue shall be calculated for the most recent full calendar year for which data are available and shall include sales to both seasonal and nonseasonal consumers. If, at the time of loan approval, the area to be served is an urbanized area (notwithstanding that the area must be deemed a rural area to qualify for a loan under this part (See the definition of “rural area” in 7 CFR 1710.2)), then the borrower must satisfy the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section to qualify to the 5 percent hardship interest rate. If at the time of loan approval, such area is outside an urbanized area, the loan shall not be subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrator's discretion.</E> The Administrator may make a hardship rate loan if, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the borrower has experienced a severe hardship. The Administrator shall consider, among other matters, whether factors beyond the control or substantial influence of the borrower have had severe adverse effect on the borrower's ability to provide service consistent with the purposes of the RE Act, and which prudent management could not reasonably anticipate and either prevent or insure against. Among the factors that may be considered are system damage due to unusual weather or other natural disasters or Acts of God, loss of substantial loads, extreme rate disparity compared to a contiguous utility, and other factors that cause severe financial hardship. The Administrator will also consider whether a hardship rate loan will provide significant relief to the borrower in dealing with the severe hardship.</P>

Except as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, amortization of funds advanced 2 years or more after the date of the note shall begin with the scheduled loan payment billed in the month following the month of the advance.</P>
              <P>(2) For advances made 2 years or more after the date of the note, the Administrator may authorize deferral of amortization of principal for a period of up to 2 years from the date of the advance if the Administrator determines that failure to authorize such deferral would adversely affect either the Government's financial interest or the achievement of the purposes of the RE Act.</P>
              <P>(b) For insured loans approved before February 21, 1995, amortization of principal shall begin 2 years after the date of the note for advances made during the first and second years of the loan, and 4 years after the date of the note for advances made during the third and fourth years.</P>

              <P>(b) RUS may rescind loans pursuant to § 1714.56.</P>
              <P>(c) Borrowers who prepay RUS loans at a discounted present value pursuant to 7 CFR part 1786, subpart F, are required to rescind the unadvanced balance of all outstanding electric notes pursuant to 7 CFR 1786.158(j).</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart establishes RUS policies and procedures for mergers of electric borrowers. These policies and procedures are intended to provide borrowers with the flexibility to negotiate and enter into mergers that offer advantages to the borrowers and to rural communities, and adequately protect the integrity and credit quality of RUS loans and loan guarantees.</P>

              <P>(b) Consistent with prudent lending practices, the maintenance of adequate security for RUS loans and loan guarantees, and the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (RE Act), RUS encourages electric borrowers to consider mergers when such action is likely to contribute, in the long-term, to greater operating efficiency and financial soundness. Borrowers are specifically encouraged to explore mergers that are likely to enhance the ability of the successor to provide reliable electric service at reasonable cost to RE Act beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(c) Pursuant to the loan documents and RUS regulations, certain mergers are subject to RUS approval. See § 1717.615.</P>
              <P>(d) Since RUS must take action in order to advance funds and otherwise conduct business with a successor, RUS encourages borrowers to consult RUS early in the process regardless of whether RUS approval of the merger is required. RUS will provide technical assistance and guidance to borrowers to help expedite the processing of their requests and to help resolve potential problems early in the process.</P>

              <P>In order for RUS to advance funds, send bills, and otherwise conduct business with a successor, the documents listed in this section must be submitted to RUS regardless of the need for RUS approval of the merger. Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that these documents are received by RUS in timely fashion. In cases of mergers that require RUS approval, or cases where borrowers must submit requests for transitional assistance, the documents listed in this section may be combined with the documents required by § 1717.157 and/or § 1717.160 where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(a) Prior to the effective date, borrowers must submit:</P>
              <P>(1) A transmittal letter on corporate letterhead signed by the manager of each active borrower that is a party to the proposed merger indicating the borrower's intention to merge and tentative timeframes, including the proposed effective date;</P>
              <P>(2) An original certified board resolution from each party to the proposed merger affirming the board's support of the merger;</P>
              <P>(3) All documents necessary to evidence the merger pursuant to applicable law. Examples include plan of merger, articles of merger, amended articles of incorporation, bylaws, and notices and filings required by law.

              <P>RUS recognizes that short-term financial stresses can follow even the most beneficial mergers. To help stabilize electric rates, enhance the credit quality of outstanding loans made or guaranteed by the Government, and otherwise ease the transition period before the long-term efficiencies and economies of a merger can be realized, RUS may approve one or more types of transitional assistance to a successor under the conditions set forth in this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Transitional assistance in connection with new loans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Requests for transitional assistance in connection with new loans may be submitted to RUS no later than the loan application.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Loan processing priority.</E> (1) RUS loans are generally processed in chronological order based on the date the complete application is received in the regional or division office. At the borrower's request, RUS may offer loan processing priority for the first loan to a successor, provided that the loan is approved by RUS not later than 5 years after the effective date of the merger. In considering the request, the Administrator will take into account, among other factors, the amount of the loan application, whether there is a significant backlog in pending loan applications, the impact that loan priority would have on the backlog, the savings and efficiencies to be realized from the merger and the relative importance of loan priority to facilitating the merger. The Administrator may, in his or her sole discretion, grant or decline to grant priority, or grant priority for a limited amount of the loan application while deferring for later consideration the remainder of the application.</P>

              <P>(2) For any subsequent loans approved during those 5 years, RUS may offer loan processing priority. In reviewing requests for loan processing priority on subsequent loans, RUS will consider the loan authority for the fiscal year, the borrower's projected cash flows, its electric rates and rate disparity, and the likely mitigation effects of priority loan processing. <E T="03">See</E> 7 CFR 1710.108 and 1710.119.</P>
              <P>(3) Loan processing priority is available following any merger where at least one of the merging parties is an active borrower.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Supplemental financing.</E> (1) RUS generally requires that an applicant for a municipal rate loan obtain a portion of its debt financing from a supplemental source without an RUS guarantee. See 7 CFR 1710.110. RUS will, at the borrower's request, waive the requirement to obtain supplemental financing for the first RUS loan approved after the effective date if that first loan is a municipal rate loan whose loan period does not exceed 2 years, and the loan is approved by RUS not later than 5 years after the effective date. For any subsequent loans approved during these 5 years, or if the borrower requests a loan period longer than 2 years, RUS may, subject to the availability of loan funds, waive or reduce the amount of supplemental financing required. In reviewing requests to reduce or waive supplemental financing on subsequent loans or on loans with a loan period longer than 2 years, RUS will consider the differences in interest rates between RUS and supplemental loans and the impacts of this difference on the borrower's projected cash flows and its electric rates and rate disparity. If significant differences would result, the waiver will be granted.</P>
              <P>(2) Waiver of supplemental financing may be available if:</P>

              <P>(i) All parties to the merger are active distribution borrowers, <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) At least one of the merging parties is an active distribution borrower, all merging parties are either active distribution borrowers or former distribution borrowers, <E T="03">and</E> the merger is effective after December 19, 1996.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reimbursement of general funds and interim financing.</E> (1) Borrowers may request RUS loan funds to reimburse general funds and/or interim financing used to finance equipment and facilities included in a RUS approved construction work plan or amendment if the construction was completed immediately preceding the current loan period. This reimbursement period is generally limited to 24 months. See 7 CFR 1710.109. RUS may, in connection with the first RUS loan approved after the effective date, approve a reimbursement period of up to 48 months prior to the current loan period if the loan is approved not later than 5 years after the effective date. In reviewing requests for this longer reimbursement period, RUS will consider the stresses that the transaction and other costs of entering into the merger places on the borrower's rates and cash flows, and the mitigating effects of more generous reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(2) A longer reimbursement period may be available if:</P>

              <P>(i) All parties to the merger are active distribution borrowers, <E T="03">or</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="107"/>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) At least one of the merging parties is an active distribution borrower, all merging parties are either active distribution borrowers of former distribution borrowers, <E T="03">and</E> the merger is effective after December 19, 1996.</P>

              <P>Requests for transitional assistance affecting new and preexisting loans must be received by RUS no later than 2 years after the effective date.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Section 12 deferments.</E> (1) Section 12 of the RE Act (7 U.S.C. 912) allows RUS to extend the time of payment of interest or principal of RUS loans. Section 12 deferments do not extend the final maturity of the loan; lower payments during the deferment period result in higher payments later. Therefore, RUS may approve a Section 12 deferment of loan payments of up to 5 years only if such deferments will help to avoid substantial increases in retail electric rates during the transition period, without placing borrowers in financial stress after the deferment period.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 12 deferment may be available following any merger where at least one of the merging parties is an active borrower.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Coverage ratios.</E> Required levels for coverage ratios are set forth in 7 CFR 1710.114 and in the loan documents. RUS may approve a plan, on a case by case basis, that provides for a phase-in period for these coverage ratios of up to 5 years from the effective date. Under such a plan the successor would be permitted to project and achieve lower levels for one or more of these coverage ratios during the phase-in period.</P>
              <P>(1) A phase-in plan for coverage ratios must provide a pro forma level for each ratio during each year of the phase-in period and be supported by a financial forecast covering a period of not less than 10 years from the effective date of the merger. The plan must demonstrate that a minimum TIER level of 1.00 will be achieved in each year, that trends will be generally favorable, that the borrower will achieve the levels required in its loan documents and RUS regulations by the end of the phase-in period, and that these levels will be maintained in subsequent years.</P>
              <P>(2) In reviewing phase-in plans for coverage ratios, RUS will review rates, rate disparity, and likely mitigating effects of the proposed phase-in plan.</P>
              <P>(3) The borrower is responsible for obtaining approvals of supplemental lenders.</P>
              <P>(4) Upon RUS approval of a phase-in plan, the levels in that plan will be substituted for the levels required in the borrower's preexisting loan documents and will be incorporated in any new loan or security documents.</P>
              <P>(5) A phase in plan for coverage ratios may be available if:</P>

              <P>(i) All parties to the merger are active distribution borrowers, <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>

              <P>The fund advance period for an insured loan, which is the period during which RUS may advance loan funds to a borrower, terminates automatically after a specific period of time. See 7 CFR 1714.56. If, on the effective date the original fund advance period or the fund advance period as extended pursuant to 7 CFR 1714.56(c), on any preexisting RUS loan to any of the active borrowers involved in a merger has not terminated, such fund advance period shall be automatically lengthened by 2 years. On the borrower's request RUS will prepare documents necessary for the advance of loan funds. RUS will prepare documents for the borrower's execution that will reflect this extension and will provide the legal authority for RUS to advance funds to the successor.</P>

              <P>(a) If the merger requires RUS approval, the borrower should, where possible, indicate that it desires transitional assistance at the time it requests approval of the merger. The formal request for transitional assistance <PRTPAGE P="108"/>must be received by RUS as specified in §§ 1717.155 and 171.156. Documents listed in this section may be combined with the documents required by §§ 1717.152 and/or 1717.160 where appropriate. If the request for transitional assistance is submitted at the same time as a loan application, documents listed in this section may be combined with the loan application documents where appropriate. See 7 CFR part 1710, subpart I. A request for transitional assistance must include:</P>
              <P>(1) Transmittal letter(s) formally listing the types of transitional assistance requested. If the request is submitted before the effective date, a transmittal letter must be signed by the manager of each party to the transaction. If the request is submitted on or after the effective date, a transmittal letter must be signed by the manager of the successor. Transmittal letter(s) must be signed originals on corporate letterhead stationery;</P>
              <P>(2) Board resolution(s). If the request is submitted before the effective date, a separate board resolution must be submitted from each entity involved in the merger. If the request is submitted on or after the effective date, a board resolution from the successor must be submitted. Each board resolution must be a certified original;</P>
              <P>(3) A merger plan, financial forecasts, and any available studies such as net present value analyses showing the anticipated costs and benefits of the merger and likely timeframes for the merger. The merger plan must clearly identify those benefits that cannot be achieved without a merger, and those benefits that can be achieved through other means;</P>
              <P>(4) If the transitional assistance requires RUS approval, the type and extent of the mitigation that the transitional assistance is expected to provide; and</P>
              <P>(5) Other information that may be relevant.</P>
              <P>(b) Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that requests for transitional assistance are complete and sound in form and substance when they are submitted to RUS. After submitting a request, borrowers shall promptly notify RUS of any changes or events that materially affect the request or any information in the request.</P>
              <P>(c) In considering whether to approve requests for transitional assistance, RUS will evaluate the costs and benefits of the merger; the type and extent of the likely transitional stress; whether the transitional assistance requested is likely to materially mitigate such stress; and the likely impacts on electric rates and on the security of RUS loans. Review factors applicable to each type of transitional assistance are set forth in §§ 1717.154-1717.156.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The loan contract and mortgage between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and electric borrowers imposes certain restrictions and controls on the borrowers and gives RUS (and other co-mortgagees in the case of the mortgage) the right to approve or disapprove certain actions contemplated by the borrowers. Certain of these controls and approval rights are referred to informally as “operational controls” because they pertain to decisions or actions with respect to the operation of the borrowers' electric systems. The approval authority granted to RUS by the loan contract or mortgage regarding each decision or action subject to controls is often stated in broad, unlimited terms. This subpart lists the main operational controls affecting borrowers and establishes for each area of control the circumstances under which RUS approval of a decision or action by a borrower is either required or not required. In some cases, only the general principles or general circumstances pertaining to RUS approval or control are presented in this subpart, while the details regarding the circumstances and requirements of RUS approval or control are set forth in other RUS regulations. Since this subpart addresses only the main operational controls, failure to address a control or approval right in this subpart in no way invalidates such controls or rights established by the loan contract, mortgage, other agreements between a borrower and RUS, and RUS regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Case by case amendments.</E> Upon written notice to a borrower, RUS may amend or annul the approvals and exceptions to controls set forth in this subpart or other RUS regulations if the borrower is in violation of any provision of its loan documents or any other agreement with RUS, or if RUS determines that loan security and/or repayment is threatened. Such amendment or annulment will apply to decisions and actions of the borrower after said written notice has been provided by RUS.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Generic notices.</E> By written notice to all borrowers or a group of borrowers, RUS may grant or waive approval of decisions and actions by the borrowers that are controlled under the loan documents and RUS regulations. RUS may also by written notice withdraw or cut back its grant or waiver of approval of said decisions and actions made by previous written notice, but may not by such notice extend its authority to approve decisions and actions by borrowers beyond the authority granted by the loan documents and RUS regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This subpart sets forth general regulations for implementing and interpreting provisions of the RUS mortgage and loan contract regarding investments, loans, and guarantees made by electric borrowers, as well as the provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, including section 312 (7 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (RE Act), permitting, in certain circumstances, that electric borrowers under the RE Act may, without restriction or prior approval of the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), invest their own funds and make loans or guarantees.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> RUS electric borrowers are encouraged to utilize their own funds to participate in the economic development of rural areas, provided that such activity does not in any way put government funds at risk or impair a borrower's ability to repay its indebtedness to RUS and other lenders. In considering whether to make loans, investments, or guarantees, borrowers are expected to act in accordance with prudent business practices and in conformity with the laws of the jurisdictions in which they serve. RUS assumes that borrowers will use the latitude afforded them by section 312 of the RE Act primarily to make needed investments in rural community infrastructure projects (such as water and waste systems, garbage collection services, etc.) and in job creation activities (such as providing technical, financial, and managerial assistance) and other activities to promote business development and economic diversification in rural communities. Nonetheless, RUS believes that borrowers should continue to give primary consideration to safety and liquidity in the management of their funds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exclusion of certain investments, loans, and guarantees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In calculating the amount of investments, loans and guarantees permitted under this subpart, there is excluded from the computation any investment, loan or guarantee of the type which by the terms of the borrower's RUS mortgage or RUS loan contract the borrower may make in unlimited amounts without RUS approval.</P>

              <P>(1) Invest or lend funds derived directly from:</P>
              <P>(i) Grants which the borrower in not obligated to repay, regardless of the source or purpose of the grant; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Loans received from or guaranteed by any Federal, State or local government program designed to promote rural economic development, provided that the borrower uses the loan proceeds for such purpose;</P>
              <P>(2) Make loans guaranteed by an agency of USDA, up to the amount of principal whose repayment, with interest, is fully guaranteed; and</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Make unlimited investments in and unlimited loans to finance the following community infrastructure that serves primarily consumers located in rural areas as defined in 7 CFR 1710.2, and guarantee debt issued for the construction or acquisition of such infrastructure, up to an aggregate amount of such guarantees not to exceed 20 percent of the borrower's equity:</P>
              <P>(A) Water and waste disposal systems;</P>
              <P>(B) Solid waste disposal systems;</P>
              <P>(C) Telecommunication and other electronic communication systems; and</P>

              <P>(ii) In each of the four cases in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, if the system is a component of a larger organization other than the borrower itself (e.g., if it is a component of a subsidiary of the borrower or a corporation independent of the borrower), to be eligible for the exemption the borrower must certify annually that a majority of the gross revenues of the larger organization during the most recent fiscal year came from customers of said system who were located in a rural area.</P>
              <P>(d) Also excluded from the calculation of investments, loans and guarantees made by the borrower are:</P>
              <P>(1) Amounts properly recordable in Account 142 Customer Accounts Receivable, and Account 143 Other Accounts Receivable;</P>
              <P>(2) Any investment, loan, or guarantee that the borrower is required to make by an agency of USDA, for example, as a condition of obtaining financial assistance for itself or any other person or organization;</P>

              <P>(e) Grandfathered exclusions. All amounts of individual investments, loans, and guarantees excluded by RUS <PRTPAGE P="120"/>as of February 16, 1995 shall remain excluded. Such exclusions must have been based on the RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, regulations, bulletins, memoranda, or other written notice from RUS. Profits, interest, and other returns earned (regardless of whether or not they are reinvested) on such investments, loans and guarantees after February 16, 1995 shall be excluded only if they are eligible for exclusion under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Any new commitments of money to such investments, loans and guarantees shall likewise be excluded only if they are eligible under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) Any investment, loan or guarantee made by a borrower that is not excluded under this section or under § 1717.657(d) shall be included in the aggregate amount of investments, loans and guarantees made by the borrower, regardless of whether RUS has specifically approved the investment, loan or guarantee under § 1717.657(c), or has approved a related transaction (e.g., a lien accommodation).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1717.656</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Exemption of certain borrowers from controls.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any distribution or power supply borrower that meets all of the following criteria is exempted from the provisions of the RUS mortgage and loan contract that require RUS approval of investments, loans, and guarantees, except investments, loans, and guarantees made to extend, add to, or modify the borrower's electric system:</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower is in compliance with all provisions of its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS;</P>
              <P>(2) The average revenue per kWh for residential service received by the borrower during the two most recent calendar years does not exceed 130 percent of the average revenue per kWh for residential service during the same period for all residential consumers located in the state or states served by the borrower. This criterion applies only to distribution borrowers and does not apply to power supply borrowers. If a borrower serves customers in more than one state, the state average revenue per kWh will be based on a weighted average using the kWh sales by the borrower in each state as the weight. The calculation will be based on the two most recent calendar years for which both borrower and state-wide data are available. If a borrower fails to qualify for an exemption based solely on its failure to meet this criterion on rate disparity, at the borrower's request the Administrator may, at his or her sole discretion, exempt the borrower if he or she finds that the borrower's strengths with respect to the other criteria are sufficient to offset any weakness due to rate disparity;</P>
              <P>(3) In the most recent calendar year for which data are available, the borrower achieved an operating TIER of at least 1.0 and an operating DSC of at least 1.0, in each case based on the average of the two highest ratios achieved in the three most recent calendar years;</P>
              <P>(4) The borrower's ratio of net utility plant to long-term debt is at least 1.1, based on year-end data for the most recent calendar year for which data are available; and</P>
              <P>(5) The borrower's equity is equal to at least 27 percent of its total assets, based on year-end data for the most recent calendar year for which data are available.</P>
              <P>(b) While borrowers meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section are exempt from RUS approval of investments, loans and guarantees, they are nevertheless subject to the record-keeping, reporting, and other requirements of § 1717.658.</P>
              <P>(c) Any borrower exempt under paragraph (a) of this section that ceases to meet the criteria for exemption shall, upon written notice from RUS, no longer be exempt and shall be subject to the provisions of this subpart applicable to non-exempt borrowers. A borrower may regain its exemption if it subsequently meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, and is so notified in writing by RUS.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) A borrower that loses its exemption and is not in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract, or any other agreement with RUS may be required to restructure or reduce its portfolio of investments, loans and guarantees as provided in § 1717.653(b). If the borrower's portfolio <PRTPAGE P="121"/>exceeds the 15 percent level, the borrower will be required to restructure or reduce its portfolio to the 15 percent level or below. For example, if the borrower's mortgage or loan contract has an approval threshold, the borrower may be required to reduce its portfolio to that level, which in many cases is 3 percent of total utility plant.</P>
              <P>(2) A borrower that loses its exemption but is in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS will be required, if its investments, loans and guarantees exceed the 15 percent level, to restructure or reduce its portfolio to the 15 percent level, unless the Administrator, in his or her sole discretion, determines that such action would not be in the financial interest of the government with respect to loan security and/or repayment. (Such borrower is eligible to ask RUS to exclude a portion of its investments under the conditions set forth in § 1717.657(d).)</P>
              <P>(3) If a borrower required to reduce or restructure its portfolio does not fully comply within a reasonable period of time determined by the Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the borrower was notified of its loss of exemption, then, upon written notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan contract and/or RUS mortgage.</P>
              <P>(e) By no later than July 1 of each year, RUS will provide written notice to any borrowers whose exemption status has changed as a result of more recent data being available for the qualification criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, or as a result of other reasons, such as corrections in the available data. An explanation of the reasons for any changes in exemption status will also be provided to the borrowers affected.</P>

              <P>(2) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the Administrator's authority to exercise approval rights over investments, loans, and guarantees made by a borrower that is not in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract and any other agreements with RUS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Distribution borrowers.</E> Distribution borrowers not exempt from RUS investment controls under § 1717.656(a) may not make investments, loans and guarantees in an aggregate amount in excess of 15 percent of total utility plant.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Power supply borrowers.</E> (1) Power supply borrowers not exempt from RUS investment controls under § 1717.656(a) may request approval to exceed the 15 percent level if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Satisfactory evidence has been provided that the borrower is in compliance with all provisions of its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS;</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower is not in financial workout and has not had its government debt restructured;</P>
              <P>(iii) The borrower has equity equal to at least 5 percent of its total assets; and</P>
              <P>(iv) After approval of the investment, loan or guarantee, the aggregate of the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees will not exceed 20 percent of the borrower's total utility plant.</P>
              <P>(2) Borrower requests for approval to exceed the 15 percent level will be considered on a case by case basis. The requests must be made in writing.</P>
              <P>(3) In considering borrower requests, the Administrator will take the following factors into consideration:</P>

              <P>(i) The repayment of all loans secured under the RUS mortgage will continue to be assured, and loan security must continue to be reasonably adequate, even if the entire investment or loan is lost or the borrower is required to perform for the entire amount of the guarantee. These risks <PRTPAGE P="122"/>will be considered along with all other risks facing the borrower, whether or not related to the investment, loan or guarantee;</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of investments, the investment must be made in an entity separate from the borrower, such as a subsidiary, whereby the borrower is protected from any liabilities incurred by the separate entity, unless the borrower demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that making the investment directly rather than through a separate entity will present no substantial risk to the borrower in addition to the possibility of losing all or part of the original investment;</P>
              <P>(iii) The borrower must be economically and financially sound as indicated by its costs of operation, competitiveness, operating TIER and operating DSC, physical condition of the plant, ratio of equity to total assets, ratio of net utility plant to long-term debt, and other factors; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Other factors affecting the security and repayment of government debt, as determined by the Administrator on a case by case basis.</P>
              <P>(4) If the Administrator approves an investment, loan or guarantee, such investment, loan or guarantee will continue to be included when calculating the borrower's ratio of aggregate investments, loans and guarantees to total utility plant.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Distribution and power supply borrowers.</E> If the aggregate of the investments, loans and guarantees of a distribution or power supply borrower exceeds 15 percent of the borrower's total utility plant as a result of the cumulative profits or margins, net of losses, earned on said transactions over the past 10 calendar years (i.e., the sum of all profits earned during the 10 years on all transactions—including interest earned on cash accounts, loans, and similar transactions—less the sum of all losses experienced on all transactions during the 10 years) then:</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower will not be in default of the RUS loan contract or RUS mortgage with respect to required approval of investments, loans and guarantees, provided that the borrower had not made additional net investments, loans or guarantees without approval after reaching the 15 percent level; and</P>
              <P>(2) At the request of the borrower, the Administrator in his or her sole discretion may decide to exclude up to the amount of net profits or margins earned on the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees during the past 10 calendar years, if the Administrator determines that such exclusion will not increase loan security risks. The borrower must provide documentation satisfactory to the Administrator as to the current status of its investments, loans and guarantees and the net profits earned during the past 10 years. Any exclusion approved by the Administrator may or may not reduce the level of investments, loans and guarantees to or below the 15 percent level. If such exclusion does not reduce the level to or below the 15 percent level, RUS will notify the borrower in writing that it must reduce or restructure its investments, loans and guarantees to a level of not more than 15 percent of total utility plant. If the borrower does not come within the 15 percent level within a reasonable period of time determined by the Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the borrower was notified of the required action, then, upon written notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan contract and mortgage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Records, reports and audits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Every borrower shall maintain accurate records concerning all investments, loans and guarantees made by it. Such records shall be kept in a manner that will enable RUS to readily determine:</P>
              <P>(1) The nature and source of all income, expenses and losses generated from the borrower's loans, guarantees and investments;</P>
              <P>(2) The location, identity and lien priority of any loan collateral resulting from activities permitted by this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(3) The effects, if any, which such activities may have on the feasibility of loans made, guaranteed or lien accommodated by RUS.</P>

              <P>(b) In determining the aggregate amount of investments, loans and guarantees made by a borrower, the borrower shall use the recorded value of each investment, loan or guarantee as reflected on its books and records <PRTPAGE P="123"/>for the next preceding end-of-month, except for the end-of-year report which shall be based on December 31 information. Every borrower shall also report annually to RUS, in the manner and on the form specified by the Administrator, the current status of each investment, outstanding loan and outstanding guarantee which it has made pursuant to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) The records of borrowers shall be subject to the auditing procedures prescribed in part 1773 of this chapter. RUS reserves the right to review the financial records of any subsidiaries of the borrower to determine if the borrower is in compliance with this subpart, and to ascertain if the debts, guarantees (as defined in this subpart), or other obligations of the subsidiaries could adversely affect the ability of the borrower to repay its debts to the Government.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS will monitor borrower compliance with this subpart based primarily on the annual financial and statistical report submitted by the borrower to RUS and the annual auditor's report on the borrower's operations. However, RUS may inspect the borrower's records at any time during the year to determine borrower compliance. If a borrower's most recent annual financial and statistical report shows the aggregate of the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees to be below the 15 percent level, that in no way relieves the borrower of its obligation to comply with its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and this subpart with respect to Administrator approval of any additional investment, loan or guarantee that would cause the aggregate to exceed the 15 percent level.</P>

              <P>(a) Nothing in this subpart shall affect any provision, covenant, or requirement in the RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, or any other agreement between a borrower and RUS with respect to any matter other than the prior approval by RUS of investments, loans, and guarantees by the borrower, such matters including, without limitation, extensions, additions, and modifications of the borrower's electric system. Also, nothing in this subpart shall affect any rights which supplemental lenders have under the RUS mortgage, or under their loan contracts or other agreements with their borrowers, to limit investments, loans and guarantees by their borrowers to levels below 15 percent of total utility plant.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS will require that any electric loan made or guaranteed by RUS after October 23, 1995 shall be subject to a provision in the loan contract or mortgage restricting investments, loans and guarantees by the borrower substantially as follows: The borrower shall not make any loan or advance to, or make any investment in, or purchase or make any commitment to purchase any stock, bonds, notes or other securities of, or guaranty, assume or otherwise become obligated or liable with respect to the obligations of, any other person, firm or corporation, except as permitted by the RE Act and RUS regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS reserves the right to change the provisions of the RUS mortgage and loan contract relating to RUS approval of investments, loans and guarantees made by the borrower, on a case-by-case basis, in connection with providing additional financial assistance to a borrower after October 23, 1995.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope and applicability.</E> (1) This subpart R establishes policies and procedures for the accommodation, subordination or release of the Government's lien on borrower assets, including approvals of supporting documents and related loan security documents, in connection with 100 percent private sector financing of facilities and other purposes. Policies and procedures regarding lien accommodations for concurrent supplemental financing required in connection with an RUS insured loan are set forth in subpart S of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) This subpart and subpart S of this part apply only to debt to be secured under the mortgage, the issuance of which is subject to the approval of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) by the terms of the borrower's mortgage with respect to the issuance of additional debt or the refinancing or refunding of debt. If RUS approval is not required under such terms of the mortgage itself, a lien accommodation is not required. If the loan contract or other agreement between the borrower and RUS requires RUS approval with respect to the issuance of debt or making additions to or extensions of the borrower's system, such required approvals do not by themselves result in the need for a lien accommodation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overall policy.</E> (1) Consistent with prudent lending practices, the maintenance of adequate security for RUS's loans, and the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act (RE Act), it is the policy of RUS to provide effective and timely assistance to borrowers in obtaining financing from other lenders by sharing RUS's lien on a borrower's assets in order to finance electric facilities, equipment and systems, and certain other types of community infrastructure. In certain circumstances, RUS may facilitate the financing of such assets by subordinating its lien on specific assets financed by other lenders.</P>
              <P>(2) It is also the policy of RUS to provide effective and timely assistance to borrowers in promoting rural development by subordinating RUS's lien for financially sound rural development investments under the conditions set forth in § 1717.858.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Decision factors.</E> In determining whether to accommodate, subordinate, or release its lien on property pledged by the borrower under the RUS mortgage, RUS will consider the effects of such action on the achievement of the purposes of the RE Act, the repayment and security of RUS loans secured by the mortgage, and other factors set forth in this subpart. The following factors will be considered in assessing the effects on the repayment and security of RUS loans:</P>
              <P>(1) The value of the added assets compared with the amount of new debt to be secured;</P>
              <P>(2) The value of the assets already pledged under the mortgage, and any effects of the proposed transaction on the value of those assets;</P>
              <P>(3) The ratio of the total outstanding debt secured under the mortgage to the value of all assets pledged as security under the mortgage;</P>
              <P>(4) The borrower's ability to repay debt owed to the Government, as indicated by the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Revenues, costs (including interest, lease payments and other debt service costs), margins, Times Interest Earned Ratio (TIER), Debt Service Coverage (DSC), and other case-specific economic and financial factors;</P>
              <P>(ii) The variability and uncertainty of future revenues, costs, margins, TIER, DSC, and other case-specific economic and financial factors;</P>
              <P>(iii) Future capital needs and the ability of the borrower to meet those needs at reasonable cost;</P>
              <P>(iv) The ability of the borrower's management to manage and control its system effectively and plan for future needs; and</P>
              <P>(5) Other factors that may be relevant in individual cases, as determined by RUS.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental review requirements.</E> The environmental review requirements of 7 CFR part 1970 apply to applications for subordinations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Co-mortgagees.</E> Other mortgagees under existing mortgages shared with RUS may have the right to approve requests for lien accommodations, subordinations and releases. In those cases, borrowers would have to obtain the approval of such mortgagees in order for <PRTPAGE P="125"/>the lien of the mortgage to be accommodated, subordinated or released. Any reference in this subpart to waiving by RUS of any of its rights under the mortgage shall apply only to the rights of RUS and shall not apply to the rights of any other co-mortgagee.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Safety and performance standards.</E> (1) To be eligible for a lien accommodation or subordination from RUS, a borrower must comply with RUS standards regarding facility and system planning and design, construction, procurement, and the use of materials accepted by RUS, as required by the borrower's mortgage, loan contract, or other agreement with RUS, and as further specified in RUS regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) RUS “Buy American” requirements shall not apply.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Advance of funds.</E> (1) The advance of funds from 100 percent private loans lien accommodated or subordinated by RUS will not be subject to RUS approval. It is the private lender's responsibility to adopt reasonable measures to ensure that such loan funds are used for the purposes for which the loan was made and the lien accommodation or subordination granted. RUS encourages lenders to adopt the following measures:</P>
              <P>(i) Remit loan advances to a separate subaccount of the Cash-Construction Fund-Trustee Account;</P>
              <P>(ii) Obtain a certification from a registered professional engineer, for each year during which funds from the separate subaccount are utilized by the borrower, that all materials and equipment purchased and facilities constructed during the year from said funds comply with RUS safety and performance standards, as required by paragraph (f) of this section, and are included in an CWP or CWP amendment.</P>
              <P>(iii) Obtain an auditor's certification from a Certified Public Accountant, for each year during which funds are advanced to or remitted from the separate subaccount, certifying:</P>
              <P>(A) The amount of loan funds advanced to and remitted from the separate subaccount during the period of review;</P>
              <P>(B) That based on the auditor's review of construction work orders and other records, all moneys disbursed from the separate subaccount during the period of review were used for purposes contemplated in the loan agreement and the lien accommodation; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Immediately notify RUS in writing if the lender is unable to obtain the certifications cited in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The measures listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section will normally be sufficient to meet the lender's responsibility provided that additional measures are not reasonably required based on the particular circumstances of an individual case. Should a lender fail to carry out its responsibility in the manner described in this paragraph (g) or in another manner acceptable to RUS, RUS may disqualify such lender from participation in advance approval under §§ 1717.854 and 1717.857 and condition the lender's receipt of a lien accommodation or subordination upon the lender providing satisfactory evidence that it will fulfill its responsibility under this paragraph (g).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Contracting and procurement procedures.</E> (1) Facilities financed with debt obtained entirely from non-RUS sources, without an RUS loan guarantee, are not subject to RUS post-loan requirements regarding contracting, procurement and bidding procedures; contract close-out procedures pertaining to project completion, final payment of contractor, and related matters; and standard forms of construction and procurement contracts listed in 7 CFR 1726.300.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent that provisions in a borrower's loan contract or mortgage in favor of RUS may be inconsistent with paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(1) of this section, paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(1) of this section are intended to constitute an approval or waiver under the terms of such instruments, and in any regulations implementing such instruments, with respect to facilities financed with debt obtained entirely from non-RUS sources without an RUS guarantee.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Access of handicapped to buildings and seismic safety.</E> A borrower must meet the following requirements to be eligible for a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of the construction of buildings:<PRTPAGE P="126"/>
              </P>

              <P>(1) The borrower must provide RUS with a certification by the project architect that the buildings will be designed and constructed in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), as applicable under that Act, and that the facilities will be readily accessible to and usable by persons with handicaps in accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), (Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101.19, subpart 101-19.6). The certification must be included in the borrower's application for a lien accommodation or subordination. In addition to these requirements, building construction may also be subject to requirements of The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower must comply with RUS's seismic safety requirements set forth in 7 CFR part 1792, subpart C.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Breach of warranty.</E> Any breach of any warranty or agreement or any material inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, certificate, document, or opinion submitted pursuant to this subpart, including, without limitation, any agreement or representation regarding the use of funds from loans lien accommodated or subordinated pursuant to this subpart, shall constitute a default by the borrower under the terms of its loan agreement with RUS.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Guaranteed loans.</E> The provisions of this subpart do not apply to lien accommodations or subordinations sought for loans guaranteed by RUS. Such lien accommodations and subordinations are governed by RUS regulations on guaranteed loans.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Release of lien.</E> To avoid repetition, release of lien is not mentioned in every instance where it may be an acceptable alternative to subordination of RUS's lien. Generally, lien subordination is favored over release of lien, and any decision to release RUS's lien is at the sole discretion of RUS.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Waiver authority.</E> Consistent with the RE Act and other applicable laws, any requirement, condition, or restriction imposed by this subpart, or subpart S of this part, on a borrower, private lender, or application for a lien accommodation or subordination may be waived or reduced by the Administrator, if the Administrator determines that said action is in the Government's financial interest with respect to ensuring repayment and reasonably adequate security for loans made or guaranteed by RUS.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Liability.</E> It is the intent of this subpart that any failure on the part of RUS to comply with any provisions hereof, including without limitation, those provisions setting forth specified timeframes for action by RUS on applications for lien accommodations or lien subordinations, shall not give rise to liability of any kind on the part of the Government or any employees of the Government including, without limitation, liability for damages, fees, expenses or costs incurred by or on behalf of a borrower, private lender or any other party.</P>

For example, given a $5 million loan, with a maturity of 5 years and equal principal payments of $1 million due on the anniversary date of the loan, the weighted average life would be: (.2)(1 year) + (.2)(2 years) + (.2)(3 years) + (.2)(4 years) + (.2)(5 years) = .2 years + .4 years + .6 years + .8 years + 1.0 years = 3.0 years. If instead the loan had a balloon payment of $5 million at the end of 5 years, the weighted average life would be: ($5 million/$5 million)(5 years) = 5 years.</P>

In addition to the guidance set forth in § 1717.651, RUS recommends that such investments be made through a subsidiary of the borrower in order to clearly separate the financial risks and the revenues and costs of the rural development enterprise from those of the borrower's electric utility business. This should reduce credit risks to the borrower's primary business, and minimize the possibility of undisclosed cross subsidization of the rural development enterprise by electric rate payers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lien subordination.</E> RUS will consider subordinating or releasing its lien on the stock held by a borrower in a subsidiary whose primary business directly contributes to or supports economic development and employment in rural areas, as defined in section 13 of the RE Act, when requested by a lender <PRTPAGE P="134"/>to the subsidiary, other than the borrower. To be eligible for said lien subordination or release:</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower must be current on all of its financial obligations and be in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage and loan agreement with RUS; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the judgment of RUS, the borrower must be able to repay all of its outstanding debt, and the security forall outstanding loans made to the borrower by RUS, including loans guaranteed by RUS, must be adequate, after taking into account the proposed subordination or release of lien.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application contents.</E> Applications for a lien subordination or release of lien for rural development investments must include the following information and documents:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement from the borrower requesting the lien subordination or release of lien.</P>
              <P>(2) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that the borrower is current on all of its financial obligations and is in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage and loan agreement with RUS;</P>
              <P>(3) A description of the facilities or other purposes to be financed and the projected effects on economic development and employment in rural areas;</P>
              <P>(4) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the complete application is received by RUS;</P>
              <P>(5) If requested by RUS, a long-range financial forecast providing financial projections for at least 10 years, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, which demonstrates that the borrower's system is economically viable and that the borrower will be able to repay all of its outstanding debt and meet all other financial obligations;</P>
              <P>(6) A discussion of the borrower's compliance with RUS requirements on accounting, financial reporting, record keeping, and irregularities (see § 1717.854(c)(5)). RUS will review the case and determine the effect of any noncompliance on the feasibility and security of RUS's loans, and whether the requested lien subordination or release of lien can be approved;</P>
              <P>(7) If any buildings are to be constructed with the proceeds of the loan to be made to the subsidiary:</P>
              <P>(i) A certification by the project architect that the buildings will be designed and constructed in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), as applicable under that Act, and that the facilities will be readily accessible to and usable by persons with handicaps in accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A written acknowledgement from a registered engineer or architect regarding compliance with seismic provisions of applicable model codes, as required by 7 CFR 1792.104;</P>
              <P>(8) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that flood hazard insurance will be obtained for the full value of any buildings, or other facilities susceptible to damage if flooded, that will be located in a flood hazard area;</P>
              <P>(9) Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters—Primary Covered Transactions, as required by 2 CFR part 180, as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 417;</P>
              <P>(10) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower has been informed of the Government's collection options; and</P>
              <P>(11) Other information that RUS may require to determine whether all of the applicable provisions of this subpart have been met.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application process and timeframes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that their applications for a lien accommodation or subordination are complete and sound as to substance and form before they are submitted to RUS. RUS will not accept any application that, on its face, is incomplete or inadequate as to the substantive information required by this subpart. RUS will notify borrowers in <PRTPAGE P="135"/>writing when their applications are complete and in form and substance satisfactory to RUS. A copy of all notifications of borrowers cited in this section will also be sent to the private lender.</P>
              <P>(2) It is recommended that borrowers consult with RUS staff before submitting their applications to determine whether they will likely qualify for advance approval or normal review, and to obtain answers to any questions about the information and documents required for the application.</P>
              <P>(3) A borrower shall, after submitting an application, promptly notify RUS of any changes that materially affect the information contained in its application.</P>
              <P>(4) After submitting an application and having been notified by RUS of additional information and documents and other changes needed to complete the application, if the required information and documents are not supplied to RUS within 30 calendar days of the borrower's receipt of the notice, RUS may return the application to the borrower. The borrower may resubmit the application when the required additional information and documents are available.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Timeframes.</E> The timeframes for review of applications set forth in this section are based on the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) The types of lien accommodations or subordinations requested are of the “standard” types that RUS has approved previously, i.e., the so-called Type I, II and III lien accommodations. Future revisions of the RUS mortgage may result in other “standard” types of lien accommodations and lien subordinations acceptable to RUS. Requests for lien accommodations or subordinations that are substantially different than the “standard” types previously approved by RUS may require additional time for review and action;</P>
              <P>(ii) The requested lien accommodation or subordination does not require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement. Preparation of these documents often will require additional time beyond the timeframes cited in this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The timeframes set forth in this section, except for paragraph (b)(4) of this section, which deals only with approval of a new mortgage or mortgage amendment, include RUS review and/or approval of a loan contract, if required as part of the application, and required supporting documents, such as a CWP.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Advance approval—100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities.</E> (1) Applications that qualify under § 1717.854 for advance approval of a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities are submitted to the general field representative (GFR). The GFR will work with the borrower to ensure that all components of the application are assembled. Once the application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office for further review and action. If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, a draft of these documents must be included in the application, unless the borrower has been notified that RUS wishes to prepare the documents itself.</P>
              <P>(2) If no additional or amended information is needed for RUS to complete its review of the application once it is received in the Washington Office, RUS will, within 45 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington Office, either:</P>
              <P>(i) Approve the lien accommodation or subordination if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactorily to RUS that all requirements of this subpart applicable to advance approval have been met, and send written notice to the borrower. RUS's approval, in this case and all other cases, will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a satisfactory security instrument, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require;</P>

              <P>(ii) If all requirements have not been met, so notify the borrower in writing. The application will be returned to the borrower unless the borrower requests that it be reconsidered under the requirements and procedures for normal review set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and in § 1717.856; or<PRTPAGE P="136"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Send written notice to the borrower explaining why a decision cannot be made at that time and giving the estimated date when a decision is expected.</P>
              <P>(3) If additional or amended information is needed after the application is received in the Washington Office, RUS will so notify the borrower in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington Office. If RUS subsequently becomes aware of other deficiencies in the application, additional written notice will be sent to the borrower. Within 30 calendar days of receiving all of the information required by RUS to complete its review, RUS will act on the application as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, within 30 days of receiving such documents satisfactory to RUS, including required execution counterparts, RUS will execute the documents and send them to the borrower, along with instructions pertaining to recording of the mortgage, an opinion of borrower's counsel, and other matters. RUS will promptly notify the borrower upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the borrower has complied with said instructions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Normal review—100 percent private financing of distribution, transmission, and/or generation facilities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Distribution borrowers.</E> (i) Applications from distribution borrowers for a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, transmission, and/or generation facilities (including other eligible electric utility purposes) that do not meet the criteria for advance approval, are also submitted to the GFR. Procedures at this stage are the same as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If no additional or amended information is needed for RUS to complete its review of the application once it is received in the Washington office, RUS will, within 90 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington office, send written notice to the borrower either approving the request, disapproving the request, or explaining why a decision cannot be made at that time and giving the estimated date when a decision is expected.</P>
              <P>(iii) If additional or amended information is needed after the application is received in the Washington Office, RUS will so notify the borrower in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington Office. If RUS subsequently becomes aware of other deficiencies in the application, additional written notice will be sent to the borrower. Within 90 calendar days of receiving all of the information required by RUS to complete its review, RUS will act on the application as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, the procedures and timeframes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section will apply.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Power supply borrowers.</E> (i) Applications from power supply borrowers for a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, transmission, and/or generation facilities, and other eligible electric utility purposes, are submitted to the RUS Power Supply Division, or its successor, in Washington, DC.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the borrower's application containing the information and documents required by § 1717.856, RUS will send written notice to the borrower of any deficiencies in its application as to completeness and acceptable form and substance. Additional written notices may be sent to the borrower if RUS subsequently becomes aware of other deficiencies in the borrower's application.</P>
              <P>(iii) Within 90 calendar days of receiving all of the information required by RUS to complete its review, RUS will act on the application as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, these documents will be reviewed and executed pursuant to the procedures and timeframes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Refinancing of existing debt.</E> All requests for a lien accommodation or subordination for refinancing are sent directly to the Washington office.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Advance approval.</E> (i) Within 15 calendar days of receiving the borrower's application containing the information and documents required by § 1717.857(c), <PRTPAGE P="137"/>RUS will send written notice to the borrower of any deficiencies in its application as to completeness and acceptable form and substance. Additional written notices may be sent to the borrower if RUS subsequently becomes aware of other deficiencies in the borrower's application.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 15 calendar days of receiving all of the required information and documents, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, RUS will either:</P>
              <P>(A) Approve the lien accommodation or subordination if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactorily to RUS that all requirements of § 1717.857(a) and (c) have been met, and send written notice to the borrower;</P>
              <P>(B) If all requirements have not been met, so notify the borrower in writing. The application will be returned to the borrower unless the borrower requests that it be reconsidered under the requirements and procedures for normal review set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and in § 1717.857; or</P>
              <P>(C) Send written notice to the borrower explaining why a decision cannot be made at that time and giving the estimated date when a decision is expected.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, these documents will be reviewed and executed pursuant to the procedures and timeframes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>

Additional written notices may be sent to the borrower if RUS subsequently becomes aware of other deficiencies in the borrower's application.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 30 calendar days of receiving all of the required information and documents, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, RUS will notify the borrower in writing either approving the request, disapproving the request, or explaining why a decision cannot be made at that time and giving the estimated date when a decision is expected. If the proposed refinancing involves complicated transactions such as interest rate swaps or forward delivery contracts, additional time may be required for RUS review and final action.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, these documents will be reviewed and executed pursuant to the procedures and timeframes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Rural development investments.</E> (1) Applications for a lien subordination for rural development investments are submitted by distribution borrowers to the GFR and by power supply borrowers to the RUS Power Supply Division, or its successor, in Washington, DC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Lien accommodations and subordinations under section 306E of the RE Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under section 306E of the RE Act, when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by a borrower whose net worth exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal balance of all loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by RUS, the Administrator will, without delay, offer to share the government's lien on the borrower's system or subordinate the government's lien on the property financed by the private lender, provided that the security, including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate. To qualify for a lien accommodation or subordination under this section, the investment must be an original capital investment, i.e., not a refinancing or refunding. (See § 1717.851 for the definition of capital investment.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of net worth to RUS debt ratio.</E> (1) In the case of applications for a lien accommodation, a borrower's net worth will be based on the borrower's most recent financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old at the time the application is received by RUS, and the outstanding debt owed to or guaranteed by RUS will be based on latest RUS records available. The financial and statistical reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers) are subject to RUS review and revision, and they must comply with RUS's system of accounts and accounting principles set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation.</P>
              <P>(2) Net worth shall be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of RUS Form 7 for distribution borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of RUS Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined in 7 CFR part 1767.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application requirements and process.</E> (1) If a borrower's net worth to RUS debt ratio exceeds 110 percent, as determined by RUS, and the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with RUS, and any other agreement with RUS that have not been exempted in writing by RUS, if requested RUS will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of capital investments, provided that the security, including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate. RUS's approval will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to RUS, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.</P>
              <P>(2) The application must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement from the borrower requesting the lien accommodation and including the amount and maturity of the proposed loan, a general description of the facilities or other purposes to be financed, the name and address of the lender, and an attached term sheet summarizing the terms and conditions of the proposed loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with RUS, and any other agreement with RUS that have not been exempted in writing by RUS;</P>
              <P>(iii) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the complete application is received by RUS;</P>

              <P>(iv) Draft copy of any new mortgage or mortgage amendment (supplement) required by RUS or the lender, unless RUS has notified the borrower that it wishes to prepare these documents itself;<PRTPAGE P="139"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) A copy of the loan agreement, loan note, bond or other financing instrument, unless RUS has notified the borrower that these documents need not be submitted. These documents will not be subject to RUS approval, but may be reviewed to determine whether they contain any provisions that would result in the security, including assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by RUS no longer being reasonably adequate;</P>
              <P>(vi) The following certifications and reports required by law:</P>
              <P>(A) The certification by the project architect for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1717.850(i);</P>
              <P>(B) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that flood hazard insurance will be obtained for the full value of any buildings, or other facilities susceptible to damage if flooded, that will be located in a flood hazard area;</P>
              <P>(C) Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters—Primary Covered Transactions, as required by 2 CFR part 180, adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 417;</P>
              <P>(D) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower has been informed of the Government's collection options; and</P>
              <P>(E) The written acknowledgement from a registered engineer or architect regarding compliance with seismic provisions of applicable model codes for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1792.104. All other elements of an application listed in § 1717.855, § 1717.856, and § 1717.858(c) not listed in this paragraph (c) are exempted.</P>
              <P>(3) Applications from distribution borrowers are submitted to the general field representative (GFR), while applications from power supply borrowers are submitted to the RUS Power Supply Division, or its successor, in Washington, DC. When an application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office. If Washington office staff determine that an application is incomplete, the borrower will be promptly notified in writing about the deficiencies. When the application is complete, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien accommodation or subordination, the borrower and the lender will be promptly notified in writing that the lien accommodation or subornation has been approved, subject to the conditions cited in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Rural development and other non-electric utility investments.</E> Although RUS recommends the use of separate subsidiaries as set forth in § 1717.858, if requested by a borrower that meets the 110 percent equity test and all other applicable requirements of this section, RUS will provide a lien subordination on the specific assets financed in the case of loans made directly to the borrower for rural development and other non-electric utility purposes, provided that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated under this paragraph (d), after taking into consideration the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination. Investments lien subordinated under this paragraph shall be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent of total utility plant limitation set forth in 7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not constitute approval of the investment under 7 CFR part 1717, subpart N.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirements and controls not exempted.</E> All requirements and limitations imposed with respect to lien accommodations and subordinations by this subpart R that are not specifically exempted by this section are not exempted and shall continue to apply according to their terms.</P>

              <P>(1) The required supplemental loan meets the requirements for an insured loan, as set forth in 7 CFR part 1710, subparts A through G, and other RUS regulations pertaining to required supplemental loans;</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower has demonstrated the ability to obtain the funds that would be needed to complete other portions of the project, if the portion to be constructed with private loan funds could not be used productively without completion of such other portions, in the event concurrent RUS insured loan funds are not forthcoming. Such evidence may include financial records demonstrating the availability of general funds, and/or a written commitment from the private lender to provide a loan for the remaining amount of financing required, with such commitment being conditioned upon the availability of a lien accommodation from RUS; and</P>
              <P>(3) An authorized official of the borrower has requested early approval of the lien accommodation and explained the reasons therefor, and has certified that the funds are needed and will be drawn down before funds from the concurrent insured loan are expected to be available, assuming that the insured loan is approved.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Timeframe for RUS action.</E> (1) RUS will either approve or disapprove the lien accommodation within 90 days of receiving the borrower's request for early approval and the complete application for the concurrent RUS loan and required supplemental financing, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, or notify the borrower in writing of the estimated date when a decision is expected. If an environmental assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is required, additional time beyond the 90 days may be required to prepare these documents. RUS's approval of the lien accommodation will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a satisfactory security instrument, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.</P>
              <P>(2) If a mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, RUS will consult with the other mortgagees as to who will prepare the documents. Within 30 days of obtaining the documents satisfactory to RUS, including required execution counterparts, RUS will execute the documents and send them to the borrower, along with instructions pertaining to recording of the mortgage, an opinion of borrower's counsel, and other matters. RUS will promptly notify the borrower upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the borrower has complied with said instructions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval of concurrent insured loan.</E> Early approval of a lien accommodation for a required supplemental loan does not ensure that the concurrent RUS insured loan will be approved. The request for the concurrent insured loan will be reviewed when funds are available to make the loan. The borrower may be requested to update certain supporting information in <PRTPAGE P="141"/>the loan application if substantial time has elapsed since the lien accommodation or subordination was approved.</P>

RUS's approval will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to RUS, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of net worth to RUS debt ratio.</E> A borrower's ratio of net worth to RUS debt will be determined as set forth in § 1717.860(b).</P>

              <P>(a) Section 331(b) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (Con Act), as amended on April 4, 1996 by Public Law 104-127, 110 Stat. 888 (7 U.S.C. 1981), grants authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to compromise, adjust, reduce, or charge-off debts or claims arising from loans made or guaranteed under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (RE Act). Section 331(b) of the Con Act also authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to adjust, modify, subordinate, or release the terms of security instruments, leases, contracts, and agreements entered into or administered by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). The Secretary, in 7 CFR 2.47, has delegated <PRTPAGE P="142"/>authority under section 331(b) of the Con Act to the Administrator of the RUS, with respect to loans made or guaranteed by RUS.</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart sets forth the policy and standards of the Administrator of RUS with respect to the settlement of debts and claims arising from loans made or guaranteed to rural electric borrowers under the RE Act.

              <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is the policy of the Administrator that, wherever possible, all debt owed to the government, including but not limited to principal and interest, shall be collected in full in accordance with the terms of the borrower's loan documents.</P>
              <P>(b) Nothing in this subpart by itself modifies, reduces, waives, or eliminates any obligation of a borrower under its loan documents.

              <P>(d) In structuring settlements and determining the capability of the borrower to repay debt and the amount of debt recovery that is possible, the Administrator will consider, among other factors, the RE Act, the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776), the policies and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, state legislative and regulatory actions, and other market and nonmarket forces as to their effects on competition in the electric utility industry and on rural electric systems in particular. Other factors the Administrator will consider are set forth in more detail in § 1717.1204.</P>

              <P>(b) If an outstanding claim has been referred in writing to the Attorney General, the Administrator will not <PRTPAGE P="143"/>use his or her own authority to settle the claim without the approval of the Attorney General.</P>
              <P>(c) If an application for additional debt relief is received from a borrower whose debt has been settled in the past under the authority of the Attorney General, the Administrator will promptly notify the Attorney General before proceeding to consider the application.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1717.1204</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Policies and conditions applicable to settlements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Settlement of debts and claims shall be subject to the policies, requirements, and conditions set forth in this section and in § 1717.1202.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Need for debt settlement.</E> (1) The Administrator will not settle any debt or claim unless the Administrator has determined that the borrower is unable to meet its financial obligations under its loan documents according to the terms of those documents, or that the borrower will not be able to meet said obligations sometime within the period of 24 months following the month the borrower submits its application for debt settlement to RUS, and, in either case, such default is likely to continue indefinitely. The determination of a borrower's ability to meet its financial obligations will be based on analyses and documentation by RUS of the borrower's historical, current, and projected costs, revenues, cash flows, assets, opportunities to reduce costs and/or increase revenues, and other factors that may be relevant on a case by case basis.</P>
              <P>(2) In its application to RUS for debt settlement, the borrower must provide, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, an in-depth analysis supporting the borrower's contention that it is unable or will not be able to meet its financial obligations as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The analysis must include:</P>
              <P>(i) An explanation and analysis of the causes of the borrower's inability to meet its financial obligations;</P>
              <P>(ii) A thorough review and analysis of the opportunities available or potentially available to the borrower to reduce administrative overhead and other costs, improve efficiency and effectiveness, and expand markets and revenues, including but not limited to opportunities for sharing services, merging, and/or consolidating, raising rates when appropriate, and renegotiating supplier and service contracts. In the case of a power supply borrower, the study shall include such opportunities among the members of the borrower, unless the Administrator waives this requirement;</P>
              <P>(iii) Documentation of the actions taken, in progress, or planned by the borrower (and its member systems, if applicable) to take advantage of the opportunities cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Other analyses and documentation prescribed by RUS on a case by case basis.</P>
              <P>(3) RUS may require that an independent consultant provide an analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of the borrower's organization and operations, and those of its member systems in the case of a power supply borrower. The following conditions will apply:</P>
              <P>(i) RUS will select the independent consultant taking into account, among other matters, the consultant's experience and expertise in matters relating to electric utility operations, finance, and restructuring;</P>
              <P>(ii) The contract with the consultant shall be to provide services to RUS on such terms and conditions as RUS deems appropriate. The consultant's scope of work may include, but shall not be limited to, an analysis of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) How to maximize the value of the government's collateral, such as through mergers, consolidations, or sales of all or part of the collateral;</P>
              <P>(B) The viability of the borrower's system, taking into account such matters as system size, service territory and markets, asset base, physical condition of the plant, operating efficiency, competitive pressures, industry trends, and opportunities to expand markets and improve efficiency and effectiveness;</P>

              <P>(C) The feasibility and the potential benefits and risks to the borrower and the government of corporate restructuring, including aggregation and disaggregation;<PRTPAGE P="144"/>
              </P>
              <P>(D) In the case of a power supply borrower, the retail rate mark-up by member systems and the potential benefits to be achieved by member restructuring through mergers, consolidations, shared services, and other alliances;</P>
              <P>(E) The quality of the borrower's management, management advisors, consultants, and staff;</P>
              <P>(F) Opportunities for reducing overhead and other costs, for expanding markets and revenues, and for improving the borrower's existing and prospective contractual arrangements for the purchase and sale of power, procurement of supplies and services, and the operation of plant and facilities;</P>
              <P>(G) Opportunities to achieve efficiency gains and increased revenues based on comparisons with benchmark electric utilities; and</P>
              <P>(H) The accuracy and completeness of the borrower's analysis provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) RUS and, as appropriate, other creditors, will determine the extent to which the borrower and third parties (including the members of a power supply borrower) will be required to participate in funding the costs of the independent consultant;</P>
              <P>(iv) The borrower will be required to make available to the consultant all corporate documents, files, and records, and to provide the consultant with access to key employees. The borrower will also normally be required to provide the consultant with office space convenient to the borrower's operations and records; and</P>
              <P>(v) All analyses, studies, opinions, memoranda, and other documents and information produced by the independent consultant shall be provided to RUS on a confidential basis for consideration in evaluating the borrower's application for debt settlement. Such documents and information may be made available to the borrower and other appropriate parties if authorized in writing by RUS.</P>
              <P>(4) The borrower may be required to employ a temporary or permanent manager acceptable to the Administrator, to manage the borrower's operations to ensure that all actions are taken to avoid or minimize the need for debt settlement. The employment could be on a temporary basis to manage the system during the time the debt settlement is being considered, and possibly for some time after any debt settlement, or it could be on a permanent basis.</P>
              <P>(5) The borrower must submit, at a time determined by RUS, a resolution of its board of directors requesting debt settlement and stating that the borrower is either currently unable to meet its financial obligations to the government or will not be able to meet said obligations sometime within the next 24 months, and that, in either case, the default is likely to continue indefinitely.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Debt settlement measures.</E> (1) If the Administrator determines that debt settlement is appropriate, the debt settlement measures the Administrator will consider under this subpart with respect to direct, insured, or guaranteed loans include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Reamortization of debt;</P>
              <P>(ii) Extension of debt maturity, provided that the maturity of the borrower's outstanding debt after settlement shall not extend more than 10 years beyond the latest maturity date prior to settlement;</P>
              <P>(iii) Reduction of the interest rate charged on the borrower's debt, provided that the interest rate on any portion of the restructured debt shall not be reduced to less than 5 percent, unless the Administrator determines that reducing the rate below 5 percent would maximize debt recovery by the government;</P>
              <P>(iv) Forgiveness of interest accrued, penalties, and costs incurred by the government to collect the debt; and</P>
              <P>(v) With the concurrence of the Under Secretary for Rural Development, forgiveness of loan principal.</P>

              <P>(2) In the event that RUS has, under section 306 of the RE Act, guaranteed loans made by the Federal Financing Bank or other third parties, the Administrator may restructure the borrower's obligations by: acquiring and restructuring the guaranteed loan; restructuring the loan guarantee obligation; restructuring the borrower's reimbursement obligations; or by such means as the Administrator deems appropriate, subject to such consents and <PRTPAGE P="145"/>approvals, if any, that may be required by the third party lender.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Borrower's obligations to other creditors.</E> The Administrator will not grant relief on debt owed to the government unless similar relief, on a pro rata basis, is granted with respect to other secured obligations of the borrower, or the other secured creditors provide other benefits or value to the debt restructuring. Unsecured creditors will also be expected to contribute to the restructuring. If it is not possible to obtain the expected contributions from other creditors, the Administrator may proceed to settle a borrower's debt if that will maximize recovery by the government and will not result in material benefits accruing to other creditors at the expense of the government.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Competitive bids for system assets.</E> If requested by RUS, the borrower or the independent consultant provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall solicit competitive bids from potential buyers of the borrower's system or parts thereof. The bidding process must be conducted in consultation with RUS and use standards and procedures acceptable to RUS. The Administrator may use the competitive bids received as a basis for requiring the sale of all or part of the borrower's system as a condition of settlement of the borrower's debt. The Administrator may also consider the bids in evaluating alternative settlement measures.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Valuation of system.</E> (1) The Administrator will consider the value of the borrower's system, including, in the case of a power supply borrower, the wholesale power contracts between the borrower and its member systems. The valuation of the wholesale power contracts shall take into account, among other matters, the rights of the government and/or third parties, to assume the rights and obligations of the borrower under such contracts, to charge reasonable rates for service provided under the contracts, and to otherwise enforce the contracts in accordance with their terms. In no case will the Administrator settle a debt or claim for less than the value (after considering the government's collection costs) of the borrower's system and other collateral securing the debt or claim.</P>
              <P>(2) RUS may use such methods, analyses, and assessments as the Administrator deems appropriate to determine the value of the borrower's system.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Rates.</E> The Administrator will consider the rates charged for electric service by the borrower and, in the case of a power supply borrower, by its members, taking into account, among other factors, the practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), as adapted to the cooperative structure of borrowers, and, where applicable, FERC treatment of any investments by co-owners in projects jointly owned by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Collection action.</E> The Administrator will consider whether a settlement is favorable to the government in comparison with the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Regulatory approvals.</E> Before the Administrator will approve a settlement, the borrower must provide satisfactory evidence that it has obtained all approvals required of regulatory bodies that the Administrator determines are needed to implement rates or other provisions of the settlement, or that are needed in any other way for the borrower to fulfill its obligations under the settlement.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Conditions regarding management and operations.</E> As a condition of debt settlement, the borrower, and in the case of a power supply borrower, its members, will be required to implement those changes in structure, management, operations, and performance deemed necessary by the Administrator. Those changes may include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower may be required to undertake a corporate restructuring and/or sell a portion of its plant, facilities, or other assets</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower may be required to replace senior management and/or hire outside experts acceptable to the Administrator. Such changes may include a commitment by the borrower's board of directors to restructure and/or obtain new membership to improve board oversight and leadership;</P>
              <P>(3) The borrower may be required to agree to:<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Controls by RUS on the general funds of the borrower, as well as on any investments, loans or guarantees by the borrower, notwithstanding any limitations on RUS' control rights in the borrower's loan documents or RUS regulations; and</P>

              <P>Pursuant to section 331(b) of the Con Act, the Administrator, at his or her sole discretion, may waive or otherwise reduce conditions and requirements imposed on a borrower by its loan documents if the Administrator determines that such action will contribute to enhancement of the government's recovery of debt. Such waivers or reductions in conditions and requirements under this section shall not include the exercise of any of the debt settlement measures set forth in § 1717.1204(c), which are subject to all of the requirements of said § 1717.1204.</P>

They may include, but need not be limited to, equity infusions and guarantees of debt repayment, either from the applicant's members (in the case of a power supply borrower), or from a third party.</P>

              <P>(a) Adequate loan security must be provided for loans made or guaranteed by RUS. The loans are required to be secured by a first mortgage lien on most of the borrower's assets substantially in the form set forth in appendix A of this subpart. At the discretion of RUS, this model form of mortgage may be adapted to satisfy different legal requirements among the states and individual differences in lending circumstances, provided that such adaptations are consistent with the policies set forth in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) Some borrowers, such as certain public power districts, may not be able to provide security in the form of a first mortgage lien on their assets. In these cases RUS will consider accepting other forms of security, such as resolutions and pledges of revenues.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS may require supplemental and amending mortgages to protect its security, or in connection with additional loans.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS may also require such other security instruments (such as loan contracts, security agreements, financing statements, guarantees, and pledges) as it deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) All distribution borrowers that receive a loan or loan guarantee from RUS on or after August 17, 1995 will be required to enter into a mortgage with RUS that meets the requirements of this subpart. The concurrence of any other lenders secured under the borrower's existing mortgage may be required before the borrower can enter into a new mortgage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the policies, requirements, and procedures governing loan contracts entered into between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and distribution borrowers or, in some cases, other electric borrowers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Flexibility for individual circumstances.</E> The intent of this subpart is to provide the flexibility to address the different needs and different credit risks of individual borrowers, and other special circumstances of individual lending situations. The model loan contract contained in appendix A of this subpart provides an example of what a loan contract with an “average” or “typical” distribution borrower may look like under “average” or “typical” circumstances. Depending on the credit risks and other circumstances of individual loans, RUS may execute loan contracts with provisions that are substantially different than those set forth in the model. RUS may develop alternative model loan contract provisions. If it does, such provisions will be made available to the public.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Resolution of any differences in contractual provisions.</E> If any provision of the loan contract appears to be in conflict with provisions of the mortgage, the loan contract shall have precedence with respect to the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS with respect to such provision. If either document is silent on a matter addressed in the other document, the other document shall have precedence with respect to the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS with respect to such matter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Certain loan contract provisions subject to subsequent rulemaking.</E> If a loan contract provision imposes an obligation or limitation on the borrower whose interpretation or specification is subject to RUS regulations or the discretion of the Administrator or RUS, such interpretation or specification shall be subject to subsequent rulemaking. Such interpretation or specification of the borrower's obligations or limitations may not exceed the authority granted to the Administrator or RUS in the loan contract provision.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1718.101</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Distribution borrowers.</E> The provisions of this subpart apply to all distribution borrowers that obtain a loan or loan guarantee from RUS approved on or after January 29, 1996. Distribution borrowers that obtain a lien accommodation or any other form of financial assistance from RUS after January 29, 1996, may be required to execute a new loan contract and new mortgage. Moreover, any distribution borrower may submit a request to RUS that a new loan contract and new mortgage be executed. Within the constraints of time and staff resources, RUS will attempt to honor such requests. Borrowers must first obtain the concurrence of any other mortgagees on their existing mortgage before a new mortgage can be executed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other borrowers.</E> Borrowers other than distribution borrowers may also submit requests for execution of a new loan contract pursuant to this subpart and a new mortgage pursuant to subpart B of this part. RUS may approve such requests if it determines that such approval is in the government's financial interest. If other mortgagees are on the borrower's existing mortgage, their concurrence would be required before a new mortgage could be executed.</P>

            <P>This part prescribes regulations implementing a guarantee program for bonds and notes issued for electrification or telephone purposes authorized by section 313A of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 940c-1).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Background.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (the “RE Act”) (7 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) authorizes the Secretary to guarantee and make loans to persons, corporations, States, territories, municipalities, and cooperative, non-profit, or limited-dividend associations for the purpose of furnishing or improving electric and telephone service in rural areas. Responsibility for administering electrification and telecommunications loan and guarantee programs along with other functions the Secretary deemed appropriate have been assigned to RUS under the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 6941 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). The Administrator of RUS has been delegated responsibility for administering the programs and activities of RUS, <E T="03">see</E> 7 CFR 1700.25. Section 6101 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-171) (FSRIA) amended the RE Act to include a new program under section 313A entitled Guarantees for Bonds and Notes Issued for Electrification or Telephone Purposes. This measure directed the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations that carry out the Program. The Secretary published the regulations for the program in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a final rule on October 29, 2004, adding part 1720 to title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 6106(a)(1)(A) of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-246) amended section 313A of the RE Act by replacing the level of “concurrent loans” as a factor limiting <PRTPAGE P="189"/>the amount of bonds and notes that could be guaranteed and inserted “for eligible electrification or telephone purposes” as the limitation on the amount of bonds and notes that can be guaranteed under section 313A up to an annual program limit of $1,000,000,000, subject to availability of funds. Section 6106(a)(1)(B) further amended section 313A of the RE Act by removing the prohibition against the recipient using an amount obtained from the reduction in funding costs as a result of a new guarantee under section 313A to reduce the interest rate charged on a new or concurrent loan.</P>

            <P>(a) In accordance with section 313A of the RE Act, a guarantee will be issued by the Secretary only if the Secretary determines, in accordance with the requirements set forth in this part, that:</P>
            <P>(1) The proceeds of the guaranteed bonds will be used by the guaranteed lender to make loans to borrowers for electrification or telephone purposes eligible for assistance under this chapter, or to refinance bonds or notes previously issued by the guaranteed lender for such purposes;</P>
            <P>(2) At the time the guarantee is executed, the total principal amount of guaranteed bonds outstanding would not exceed the principal amount of outstanding eligible loans previously made by the guaranteed lender;</P>
            <P>(3) The proceeds of the guaranteed bonds will not be used directly or indirectly to fund projects for the generation of electricity; and</P>
            <P>(4) The guaranteed lender will not use any amounts obtained from the reduction in funding costs provided by a loan guarantee issued prior to June 18, 2008, to reduce the interest rates borrowers are paying on new or outstanding loans, other than new concurrent loans as provided in part 1710 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) During the term of the guarantee, the guaranteed lender shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Limit cash patronage refunds, for guaranteed lenders having a credit rating below “A−” on its senior secured debt without regard to the guarantee. For such guaranteed lenders, cash patronage refunds are limited to five percent of the total patronage refund eligible. The limit on patronage refunds must be maintained until the credit rating is restored to “A−” or above. For those guaranteed lenders subject to patronage limitations, equity securities issued as part of the patronage refund shall not be redeemable in cash during the term of any part of the guarantee, and the guaranteed lender shall not issue any dividends on any class of equity securities during the term of the guarantee.</P>
            <P>(2) Maintain sufficient collateral equal to the principal amount outstanding, for guaranteed lenders having a credit rating below “A−” on its senior secured debt without regard to the guarantee, or in the case of a lender that does not have senior secured debt, a corporate (counterparty) credit rating below “A−” without regard to the guarantee. Collateral shall be in the form of specific and identifiable unpledged securities equal to the value of the guaranteed amount. In the case of a guaranteed lender's default, the U.S. government claim shall not be subordinated to the claims of other creditors, and the indenture must provide that in the event of default, the government has first rights on the asset. Upon application and throughout the term of the guarantee, guaranteed lenders not subject to collateral pledging requirements shall identify, with the concurrence of the Secretary, specific assets to be held as collateral should the credit rating of its senior secured debt, or its corporate credit rating, as applicable, without regard to the guarantee fall below “A−.” The Secretary has discretion to require collateral at any time should circumstances warrant.</P>
            <P>(c) The final maturity of the guaranteed bonds shall not exceed 20 years.</P>
            <P>(d) The guaranteed bonds shall be issued to the Federal Financing Bank on terms and conditions consistent with comparable government-guaranteed bonds and satisfactory to the Secretary.</P>

            <P>(e) The Secretary shall guarantee payment son guaranteed bonds in such forms and on such terms and conditions and subject to such covenants, representations, warranties and requirements (including requirements for audits) as determined appropriate for satisfying the requirements of this <PRTPAGE P="191"/>part. The Secretary shall require the guaranteed lender to enter into a guarantee agreement to evidence its acceptance of the foregoing. Any guarantee issued under this part shall be made in a separate and distinct offering.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility screening.</E> Each application will be reviewed by the Secretary to determine whether it is eligible under 7 CFR 1720.5, the information required under 7 CFR 1720.6 is complete and the proposed guaranteed bond complies with applicable statutes and regulations. The Secretary can at any time reject an application that fails to meet these requirements.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation.</E> Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, applications will be subject to a substantive review, on a competitive basis, by the Secretary based upon the following evaluation factors, listed in order of importance:</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Independent Assessment.</E> Before a guarantee decision is made by the Secretary, the Secretary shall request that the Federal Financing Bank review the adequacy of the determination by the Rating Agency, required under § 1720.5(b)(2) as to whether the bond or note to be issued would be below investment grade without the guarantee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Decisions by the Secretary.</E> The Secretary shall approve or deny applications in a timely manner as such applications are received; provided, however, that in order to facilitate competitive evaluation of applications, the Secretary may from time to time defer a decision until more than one application is pending. The Secretary may limit the number of guarantees made to a maximum of five per year, to ensure a sufficient examination is conducted of applicant requests.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and amount.</E> With the exception of minor projects, loan funds will be advanced only for projects which are included in an RUS approved construction work plan (CWP), EE Program work plan (EEWP), or approved amendment, and in an approved loan as amended. Loan fund advances can be requested in an amount representing actual costs incurred.<PRTPAGE P="196"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Minor project.</E> Minor project means a project costing $100,000 or less. Such a project qualifies for advance of loan funds even though it may not have been included in an RUS-approved borrower's CWP, amendment to such CWP, or approved loan. Total advances requested shall not exceed the total loan amount. All projects for which loan fund advances are requested must be constructed to achieve purposes permitted by terms of the loan contract between the borrower and RUS.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Pursuant to the applicable provisions of the RUS loan contract, borrowers must certify with each request for funds to be approved for advance that such funds are for projects in compliance with this section and shall also provide for those that cost in excess of $100,000, a contract or work order number as applicable and a CWP cross-reference project coded identification number. For a minor project not included in a RUS approved borrower's CWP or CWP amendment, the Borrower shall describe the project and do one of the following to satisfy RUS' environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970:</P>
              <P>(1) If applicable, state that the project is a categorical exclusion of a type described in § 1970.53 of this title; or</P>
              <P>(2) If applicable, state that the project is a categorical exclusion of a type that normally requires the preparation of an environmental report (see § 1970.54 of this title) and then submit the environmental report with the request for funds to be approved for advance.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Noncompliance.</E> Where insured loan funds are found to have been advanced in noncompliance with this section, borrowers will be required to deposit the appropriate amount of the over-advance in the construction fund-trustee account and pay any accrued and unpaid interest to RUS. The Administrator will require borrowers, in order to remedy such noncompliance, to pay an additional amount equal to the interest on the funds over-advanced for the period such funds were outstanding, calculated at a rate equal to the difference between the RUS loan interest rate and the most recent rate at which RUS sold Certificates of Beneficial Ownership (CBO's). While RUS will generally permit the amount of over-advance deposited in the construction fund-trustee account to be subsequently used by the borrower for RUS approved projects, nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude RUS from exercising any rights or remedies which RUS may have pursuant to the loan contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This subpart contains RUS procedures and conditions under which Borrowers of loans made by RUS may request RUS approval for extensions for the payment of principal and interest.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1721.101</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The procedures in this subpart are intended to provide Borrowers with the flexibility to request an extension of principal and interest as authorized under section 12(a) of the RE Act and section 236 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-606).</P>
              <P>(b) The total amount of interest that has been deferred, including interest on deferred principal, will be added to the principal balance, and the total amount of principal and interest that has been deferred will be reamortized over the remaining life of the applicable note beginning in the first year the deferral period ends.</P>

              <P>(c) Payment of principal and interest will not be extended more than 5 years after such payment is due as originally scheduled. However, in cases where the extension is being granted because, at the sole discretion of the Administrator, a severe hardship has been experienced, the Administrator may grant a longer extension provided that the maturity date of any such loan does <PRTPAGE P="197"/>not extend to a date beyond forty (40) years from the date of the note.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In reviewing requests for extension of payment of principal and interest, consideration shall be given to the effect of such extensions on the security of the Government's loans, and on the ability of the Borrower to achieve program objectives. It is the policy of RUS to extend the time for payment of principal and interest on the basis of findings that such extension does not impair the security and feasibility of the Government's loans and:</P>
              <P>(1) Is essential to the effectiveness of the Borrower's operations in achieving RUS program objectives which include providing reliable, affordable electricity to RE Act beneficiaries;</P>
              <P>(2) Is necessary to help a Borrower place its operations on a more stable financial basis and thereby provide assurance of repayment of loans within the time when payments of such loans are due under the terms of the note or notes as extended; or</P>
              <P>(3) Is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.</P>
              <P>(b) Extensions will be given in the minimum amount to achieve the purpose of the extension.</P>

              <P>(c) The maximum interest rate a RUS Borrower can charge on deferments for programs relating to consumer loans, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> energy resource conservation (ERC) program, contribution-in-aid of construction (CIAC), etc., will not be more than 300 basis points above the average interest rate on the note(s) being deferred. For example, if the RUS Borrower's average interest rate on the note(s) being deferred is 5 percent, the RUS Borrower can charge a maximum interest rate of 8 percent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible purposes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deferments for financial hardship.</E> (1) In cases of financial hardship, a Borrower may request that RUS defer principal or interest or both. RUS will consider whether the deferral will help a Borrower place its operations on a more stable financial basis and thereby provide assurance of repayment of loans within the time when payment of such loans are due under the terms of the note or notes as extended.</P>
              <P>(2) RUS will determine whether a Borrower qualifies for the deferment on a case-by-case basis, considering such factors as the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Substantial unreimbursed or uninsured expenses relating to storm damage;</P>
              <P>(ii) Loss of large power load (as defined in § 1710.7(c)(6)(ii) of this chapter, Large retail power contracts); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Substantial loss of consumers or load due to hostile annexations and condemnations, without adequate compensation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Deferments for energy resource conservation (ERC) loans.</E> (1) A Borrower may request that RUS defer principal payments to make funds available to the Borrower's consumers to conserve energy. Amounts deferred under this program can be used to cover the cost of labor and materials for the following energy conservation measures:</P>
              <P>(i) Caulking;</P>
              <P>(ii) Weather-stripping;</P>
              <P>(iii) Heat pump systems (including water source heat pumps);</P>

              <P>(ix) Pipe insulation;</P>
              <P>(x) Water heater insulation;</P>
              <P>(xi) Storm windows;</P>
              <P>(xii) Thermal windows;</P>
              <P>(xiii) Storm or thermal doors;</P>
              <P>(xiv) Electric system coordinated customer-owned devices that reduce the maximum kilowatt demand on the electric system;</P>
              <P>(xv) Clock thermostats; or</P>
              <P>(xvi) Attic ventilation fans.<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) ERC loans will be amortized over not more than 84 months, without penalty for prepayment of principal.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Deferments for renewable energy projects.</E> (1) A Borrower may request that RUS defer principal payments to enable the Borrower to finance renewable energy projects. Amounts deferred under this program can be used to cover costs to install all or part of a renewable energy system including, without limitation:</P>
              <P>(i) Energy conversion technology;</P>
              <P>(ii) Electric power system interfaces;</P>
              <P>(iii) Delivery equipment;</P>
              <P>(iv) Control equipment; and</P>
              <P>(v) Energy consuming devices.</P>
              <P>(2) A Borrower may request that RUS defer principal payments for the purpose of enabling the Borrower to provide its consumers with loans to install all or part of customer-owned renewable energy systems up to 5kW.</P>
              <P>(3) A renewable energy system is defined in § 1710.2 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) For the purpose of this subpart, a renewable energy project consists of one or more renewable energy systems.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Deferments for distributed generation projects.</E> (1) A Borrower may request that RUS defer principal payments to enable the Borrower to finance distributed generation projects. Amounts deferred under this program can be used to cover costs to install all or part of a distributed generation system that:</P>
              <P>(i) The Borrower will own and operate, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The consumer owns, provided the system owned by the consumer does not exceed 5KW.</P>
              <P>(2) A distributed generation project may include one or more individual systems.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Deferments for contributions-in-aid of construction.</E> (1) A Borrower may request RUS to defer principal payments to enable the Borrower to make funds available to new full time residential consumers to assist them in paying their share of the construction costs (contribution-in-aid of construction) needed to connect them to the Borrower's system.</P>
              <P>(2) Amounts available for this purpose will be limited to the amount of the construction costs that are in excess of the average cost per residential consumer incurred by the Borrower to connect new full time residential consumers during the last calendar year for which data are available. The average cost per residential consumer is the total cost incurred by the Borrower and will not be reduced by the amounts received as a contribution-in-aid of construction.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deferments relating to financial hardship.</E> The total amount of interest that has been deferred, including interest on deferred principal, will be added to the principal balance, and the total amount of principal and interest that has been deferred will be reamortized over the remaining life of the applicable note beginning in the first year the deferral period ends. For example: the amount of interest deferred in years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, will be added to the principal balance and reamortized over the life of the applicable note for repayment starting in year 2008.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Deferments relating to the ERC loan program, renewable energy project(s), distributed generation project(s), and the contribution(s)-in-aid of construction.</E> An extension agreement is for a term of two (2) years. The installment will be recalculated each time the Borrower defers the payment of principal and recognition of the deferred amount will begin with the next payment. For example: the amount deferred in the October payment will be reamortized over a 84 month period starting with the next payment (November if paying on a monthly basis). When a Borrower defers principal under any of these programs the scheduled payment on the account will increase by an amount sufficient to pay off the deferred amount, with interest, by the date specified in the agreement (usually 84 months (28 quarters)).</P>

              <P>(3) For high hazard potential dams, the borrower must obtain an independent review of the design and critical features of construction. The reviewer must have demonstrated experience in the design and construction of dams of a similar size and nature. The reviewer must be a qualified engineer not involved in the original design of the dam or a Federal or State agency responsible for dam safety. The reviewer must be approved by RUS.</P>
              <P>(4) The independent review of design must include, but not necessarily be limited to, plans, specifications, design calculations, subsurface investigation reports, hydrology reports, and redesigns which result from encountering unanticipated or unusual conditions during construction.</P>
              <P>(5) The independent review of construction shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Foundation preparation and treatment.</E> When the foundation has been excavated and exposed, and before critical structures such as earth embankments or concrete structures are placed thereon, the borrower shall require the reviewer to conduct an independent examination of the foundation to ensure that suitable foundation material has been reached and that the measures proposed for treatment of the foundation are adequate. This examination must extend to the preparation and treatment of the foundation for the abutments.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Fill placement.</E> During initial placement of compacted fill materials, the borrower shall require the reviewer to conduct an independent examination to ensure that the materials being used in the various zones are suitable and that the placement and compaction procedures being used by the contractor will result in a properly constructed embankment.</P>

              <P>(6) If the reviewer disagrees with any aspect of the design or construction which could affect the safety of the dam, then the borrower must meet <PRTPAGE P="211"/>with the design engineer and the reviewer to resolve the disagreements.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Emergency action plan.</E> For high hazard potential dams, the borrower must develop an emergency action plan incorporating preplanned emergency measures to be taken prior to and following a potential dam failure. The plan should be coordinated with local government and other authorities involved with the public safety.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Borrower contractual obligations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Loan agreement.</E> As a condition of a loan or loan guarantee under the RE Act, borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrower agrees to use RUS standard forms of contracts for construction, procurement, engineering services and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. Normally, this obligation is contained in section 5.16 of the loan contract. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those forms of contract (hereinafter sometimes called“listed contract forms”) identified in the List of Required Standard Contract Forms contained in § 1724.74(c).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> If a borrower is required by this part or by its loan agreement with RUS to use a listed standard form of contract, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS, either paper or electronic format. Exact electronic reproduction is acceptable. The approved RUS standard forms of contract shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing on a case-by-case basis. Any modifications approved by RUS on a case-by-case basis must be clearly shown so as to indicate the modification difference from the standard form of contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment.</E> Where a borrower has entered into a contract in the form required by this part, no change may be made in the terms of the contract, by amendment, waiver or otherwise, without the prior written approval of RUS.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> RUS may waive for good cause, on a case by case basis, the requirements imposed on a borrower pursuant to this part. Borrowers seeking a waiver by RUS must provide RUS with a written request explaining the need for the waiver.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Violations.</E> A failure on the part of the borrower to use listed contracts as prescribed in this part is a violation of the terms of its loan agreement with RUS and RUS may exercise any and all remedies available under the terms of the agreement or otherwise.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The policies, procedures and requirements included in this part are intended to implement provisions of the standard form of loan documents between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and its electric borrowers. Unless prior written approval is received from RUS, borrowers are required to comply with RUS policies and procedures as a condition to RUS providing loans, loan guarantees, or reimbursement of general funds for the construction and improvement of electric facilities. Requirements relating to RUS approval of plans and specifications, duties and responsibilities of the engineer and architect, and engineering and architectural services contracts, are contained in other RUS regulations. The terms “RUS form”, “RUS standard form”, “RUS specification”, “and RUS bulletin” have the same meanings as the terms “REA form”, “REA standard form”, “REA specification”, “and REA bulletin”, respectively, unless otherwise noted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Each borrower is responsible for the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of its electric system. RUS, as a secured lender, has a legitimate interest in accomplishing RUS's programmatic objectives, and in assuring that the costs of construction, materials, and equipment are reasonable and economical and that the property securing the loans is constructed adequately to serve the purposes for which it is intended.</P>

              <P>The requirements of this part apply to the procurement of materials and equipment for use by electric borrowers in their electric systems and to the construction of their electric systems if such materials, equipment, and construction are financed, in whole or in part, with loans made or guaranteed by RUS, including reimbursable projects. In order for general fund expenditures for procurement or construction to be eligible for reimbursement from loan funds, the borrower must comply with the procedures required by this part. In the case of jointly owned projects, RUS will determine on a case by case basis the applicability of the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Qualified bidder list (QBL).</E> The borrower shall (acting through its engineer, if applicable) review the qualifications of prospective bidders for contract construction and for material and equipment procurement, and select firms qualified for inclusion on the borrower's list of qualified bidders for each contract. (See also § 1726.16 and § 1726.17.) A bid may not be solicited from a prospective bidder or opened by the borrower unless that bidder has been determined to be a qualified bidder for the contract. When preparing the QBL, in addition to the actual experience of the borrower, if any, in dealing with a prospective bidder, the borrower may solicit information from that bidder or from other parties with firsthand experience regarding the firm's capabilities and experience. It is also important to consider the firm's performance record, safety record, and similar factors in determining whether to include that firm on the QBL, since the borrower may not evaluate these factors when evaluating a bid from a qualified and invited bidder.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflict of interest.</E> If there is a relationship between the borrower or engineer and a prospective bidder which might cause the borrower or engineer to have or appear to have a conflict of interest, that prospective bidder shall not be included on the QBL unless the engineer discloses the nature of the relationship to the borrower. In the case of the borrower, if its employees or directors have a relationship with a prospective bidder, the prospective bidder shall not be included on the qualified bidders list unless the nature of the relationship is disclosed to the board of directors, and the board of directors specifically approves the inclusion of that bidder in light of the potential for a conflict of interest.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standard forms of contracts for borrowers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The standard loan agreement between RUS and the borrowers provides that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations in this chapter, the borrower shall use standard forms of contracts promulgated by RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services, and architectural services financed by a loan made or guaranteed by RUS. This part implements these provisions of the RUS loan agreement. Subparts A through H and J of this part prescribe when and how borrowers are required to use RUS standard forms of contracts in procurement and construction. Subpart I of this part prescribes the procedures that RUS follows in promulgating standard contract forms and identifies those contract forms that borrowers are required to use for procurement and construction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendments to contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Contract forms.</E> The borrower must use RUS Form 238, Construction or Equipment Contract Amendment, for any change or addition in any contract for construction or equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special considerations.</E> Each time an amendment to a construction contract is executed, the borrower must ensure that contractor's bond is adequate, that all necessary licenses and permits have been obtained, and that any environmental requirements associated with the proposed construction have been met.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Amendment approval requirements.</E> (i) If a RUS approved form of contract is required by this part, an amendment must not alter the terms and conditions of the RUS approved form of contract without prior RUS approval.</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower must make a contract amendment subject to RUS approval if the underlying contract was made subject to RUS approval and the total amended contract price exceeds 120 percent of the original contract price (excluding any escalation provision contained in the contract).</P>
              <P>(iii) Contract amendments, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, are not subject to RUS approval and need not be submitted to RUS unless specifically requested by RUS on a case by case basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Formal competitive bidding.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Formal competitive bidding is used for distribution, transmission, and headquarters facilities, and may be used for generation facilities. The borrower must use the following procedure for formal competitive bidding:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Selection of qualified bidders.</E> The borrower (acting through its engineer, if applicable) will compile a list of qualified bidders for each proposed contract. The borrower will send invitations to bid only to persons or organizations on its QBL for the specific project (see § 1726.23).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Invitations to bid.</E> The borrower (acting through its engineer, if applicable) is responsible for sending out invitations to prospective bidders, informing them of scheduled bid openings and taking any other action necessary to procure full, free and competitive bidding. The borrower should send out a sufficient number of invitations in order to assure adequate competition and so that at least three bids will be received. Subject to the foregoing criteria, the determination of how many and which bidders will be permitted to bid will be the responsibility of the borrower.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation basis.</E> Any factors, other than lowest dollar amount of the bid, which are to be considered in evaluating the proposals of qualified bidders (e.g., power consumption, losses, etc.) must be stated in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders.” The borrower will not evaluate a bidder's performance record, safety record, and similar factors when evaluating a bid from a qualified and invited bidder. Such factors are to be considered when determining whether to include a particular bidder on the qualified bidders list.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Handling of bids received.</E> The borrower or the engineer, as applicable, will indicate, in writing, the date and time of receipt by the borrower or the engineer on the outside envelope of each bid and all letters and other transmittals amending or modifying the bids. Any bid received at the designated location after the time specified must be returned to the bidder unopened.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Bid openings.</E> Bid openings are generally conducted by the engineer in the presence of bidders and a representative of the borrower and the borrower's attorney. Each bona fide bid must be opened publicly and reviewed for any irregularities, errors, or exceptions. It must be verified that any addendum or supplement to the specification has been acknowledged by the bidder. The adequacy of bid bonds or certified checks must be verified at this time.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Conditions affecting acceptability of bids.</E> The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Fewer than three bona fide bids received.</E> If fewer than three bona fide bids are received for the contract project, the borrower must determine that all reasonable measures have been taken to assure competition prior to awarding the contract. This determination must be documented and such documentation submitted to RUS where required by subpart A of this part. The borrower may, however, elect to reject all bids, make changes in the specification or the qualified bidders list or both and invite new bids.<PRTPAGE P="226"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Significant error or ambiguity in the specification.</E> If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is found which could result in the bidders having varying interpretations of the requirements of the bid, the borrower must either issue an addendum to each prospective bidder correcting the error or ambiguity before bids are received, or reject all bids and correct the specification. If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is discovered after the bids are opened, the borrower must reject all bids, correct the specification and invite new bids.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Minor errors or omissions in the specification.</E> If minor errors or omissions in the specification are found, the borrower must issue an addendum to each prospective bidder correcting the error or omission prior to opening any bids. After bid opening, the error or omission must be corrected in the executed contract.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Minor errors or irregularities in bid.</E> The borrower may waive minor errors or irregularities in any bid, if the borrower determines that such minor errors or irregularities were made through inadvertence. Any such minor errors or irregularities so waived must be corrected on the bid in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Non-minor error or irregularity in bid.</E> If a bid contains a non-minor error or irregularity, the bid must be rejected and the bid price must not be disclosed.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Unbalanced bid.</E> If a bid contains disproportionate prices between labor and materials or between various construction units, the borrower may reject the bid.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">No acceptable price quoted.</E> If none of the bidders quote an acceptable price, the borrower may reject all bids.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Evaluating bids.</E> The borrower (acting through the engineer, if applicable) must conduct the evaluation of bids on the basis of the criteria set out in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders.” The contract, if awarded, must be awarded to the bidder with the lowest evaluated responsive bid.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Announcement of bids.</E> If possible, the borrower will announce bids at the bid opening. However, where extensive evaluation is required, the borrower may elect to adjourn and make formal written announcement to all bidders at a later time. Any discrepancy in a rejected bid must be indicated in the bid announcement.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Award of contract.</E> Upon completion of the bid evaluations and based upon the findings and recommendations of the borrower's management and engineer, the borrower's board of directors will either:</P>
              <P>(1) Resolve to award the contract to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; or</P>
              <P>(2) Reject all bids.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Certification by the borrower and its engineer.</E> The borrower shall certify and the engineer shall certify as follows: “The procedures for formal competitive bidding, as described in 7 CFR 1726.201, were followed in awarding this contract.” The certification executed by and on behalf of the borrower and its engineer shall be submitted to RUS in writing where required by subpart A of this part.</P>

The borrower may elect to conduct clarifying discussions with the bidders. If such clarifying discussions are held, at least the three apparent low evaluated bidders must be given an equal opportunity to resolve any questions related to the substance of the bidder's proposal and to arrive at a final price for a responsive bid.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Evaluation basis.</E> Any factors, other than lowest dollar amount of the bid, which are to be considered in evaluating the proposals of qualified bidders (e.g., power consumption, losses, etc.) must be stated in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders.” The borrower will not evaluate a bidder's performance record, safety record, and similar factors when evaluating a bid from a qualified and invited bidder.

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Bid opening.</E> The contracting committee will conduct the bid opening in private. The contracting committee will open each bona fide bid which has been received prior to the deadline, and review it for any irregularities, errors, or exceptions. It must be verified that any addendum to the specification has been acknowledged by each bidder. The adequacy of bid bonds or certified checks must also be verified.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Conditions affecting acceptability of bids.</E> The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist:</P>

Otherwise, the contracting committee must give at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders an equal opportunity to participate in discussions for the purpose of resolving questions regarding the specification and contract terms and to arrive at a final price. Neither prices of other bids nor relative ranking of any bidder are to be revealed under any circumstances. Such discussions may be held by telephone or similar means provided at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders have an equal opportunity to participate. Upon completion of the clarifying discussions, the contracting committee will determine the lowest evaluated responsive bid. If no bids are responsive after the contracting committee has completed clarifying discussions, no contract award can be made under the informal bidding procedure.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Award of the contract.</E> Upon completion of the bid evaluations, the contracting committee will promptly report all findings and recommendations to the borrower's board of directors. The board will either:</P>

It must be verified that any addendum to the specification has been acknowledged by each bidder. The adequacy of bid bonds or certified checks must also be verified.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Conditions affecting acceptability of bids.</E> The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Fewer than three bona fide bids received.</E> If fewer than three bona fide bids are received for the contract project, the borrower must determine that all reasonable measures have been taken to assure competition prior to awarding the contract. This determination must be documented and such documentation submitted to RUS where required by subpart A of this part. The borrower may, however, elect to reject all bids, make changes in the specification or the qualified bidders list or both and invite new bids.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Significant error or ambiguity in the specification.</E> If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is found which could result in the bidders having varying interpretations of the requirements of the bid, the borrower must either issue an addendum to each prospective bidder correcting the error <PRTPAGE P="229"/>or ambiguity before bids are received, or reject all bids and correct the specification. If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is discovered after the bids are opened, the borrower must reject all bids, correct the specification and invite new bids.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Negotiations.</E> The contracting committee may elect not to hold any negotiations and recommend award of the contract. Otherwise, the contracting committee must give at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders an equal opportunity to participate in negotiations for the purpose of resolving questions regarding the specification and contract terms and to arrive at a final price. Neither prices of other bids nor relative ranking of any bidder are to be revealed under any circumstances. Such discussions may be held by telephone or similar means provided at least each of the three apparent lowest evaluated bidders have an equal opportunity to participate. Upon completion of the negotiations, the contracting committee will determine the bid that is in the borrower's best interest.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Award of the contract.</E> Upon completion of the bid evaluations, the contracting committee will promptly report all findings and recommendations to the borrower's board of directors. The board will either:</P>
              <P>(1) Resolve to award the contract to the selected bidder; or</P>
              <P>(2) Reject all bids.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Certifications by the contracting committee.</E> The chairperson of the contracting committee shall certify as follows: “The procedures for multiparty negotiation as described in 7 CFR 1726.203 were followed in awarding this contract.” The certification executed by the chairperson of the contracting committee shall be submitted to RUS in writing where required by subpart A of this part.</P>

              <P>RUS provides standard forms of contract for the procurement of materials, equipment, and construction and for contract amendments and various related forms for use by RUS borrowers. See § 1726.304 for a listing of these forms and how to obtain them. The standard forms of contract shall be used by the borrowers in accordance with the provisions of this part. RUS will give prior approval to certain modifications to these forms without changing the applicable requirements for RUS approval. Such approved modifications are set forth in this subpart. These are the only modifications given prior RUS approval.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prior approved contract modification related to price escalation on transmission equipment, generation equipment, and generation construction contracts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Where the borrower encounters reluctance among manufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to bid a firm price on transmission equipment or generation equipment, materials or construction, modifications may be made in the RUS standard form of contracts. These modifications, if applicable, may include, as an alternative to the standard form, provisions for adjusting a base price either upward or downward as determined by changes in specified indexes between the time of the bid and the time the <PRTPAGE P="230"/>work is performed or materials are procured by the contractor for such work. A large number of labor and materials indexes are published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The borrower (acting through its engineer, if applicable) will select the indexes for the particular item to be used in the price adjustment clause. Suppliers' corporate indexes may not be used. Labor and materials indexes are reported in the BLS's monthly publications entitled “Employment and Earnings” and “Producer Prices and Price Indexes.” These publications may be ordered through the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or any of the BLS regional offices.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Material and equipment contracts.</E> The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the material or equipment contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Insert new paragraphs in the Notice and Instructions to Bidders as follows:
              </P>

                  <E T="03">Nonfirm prices.</E> The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and material indexes.</P>
                <P>A proportion of __ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent labor cost and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate__ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the labor is incorporated in the equipment or materials. The adjustment for labor costs shall be obtained by applying the percentage of increase or decrease in such index, calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, to the percentage of the contract prices deemed to represent labor costs. A portion of __ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, material index __ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the labor cost adjustment.”</P>

              <P>(3) For equipment that uses a large quantity of insulating oil, the borrower may insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“The price for insulating oil shall be adjusted upward or downward based on the change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Refined Petroleum Rate (057) from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the oil is purchased by the equipment supplier. Contracts shall be evaluated based on an estimated cost of __ cents per gallon [the borrower will enter the appropriate cost] for oil. Such adjustment, if any, shall not change the contract amount for purpose of applying any other adjustments to the contract prices.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction contracts.</E> The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the construction contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) Insert new paragraphs in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders” as follows:</P>
              <P>“Proposals are invited on the basis of alternative Liability Clause Numbers 1 and 2. The Owner will determine on which Liability Clause basis the award will be made.

              <P>(b) As an alternative to the indemnification provision required in RUS standard construction contract forms in those jurisdictions that have a legal prohibition against one party indemnifying another for the other's negligence, the borrower may replace the words “defend, indemnify, and hold harmless” with the words “ shall pay on behalf of” so that the first paragraph reads as follows:

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Loan agreement.</E> As a condition of a loan or loan guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act, borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrower agrees to use RUS standard forms of contracts for construction, procurement, engineering services and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. Normally, this obligation is contained in section 5.16 of the loan contract. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those forms of contract (hereinafter sometimes called “listed contract forms”) identified in the List of Required Contract Forms, § 1724.304(c).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> If a borrower is required by this part or by its loan agreement with RUS to use a listed standard form of contract, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS, either paper or electronic format. Exact electronic reproduction is acceptable. The approved RUS standard forms of contract shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing on a case-by-case basis. Any modifications approved by RUS on a case-by-case basis must be clearly shown so as to indicate the modification difference from the standard form of contract.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> RUS may waive for good cause, on a case by case basis, the requirements imposed on a borrower pursuant to this part. Borrowers seeking a waiver by RUS must provide RUS with a written request explaining the need for the waiver. Waiver requests should be made prior to issuing the bid package to bidders.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Violations.</E> A failure on the part of the borrower to use listed contracts as prescribed in this part is a violation of the terms of its loan agreement with RUS and RUS may exercise any and all remedies available under the terms of the agreement or otherwise.</P>

              <P>RUS may, from time to time, undertake to promulgate new contract forms or revise or eliminate existing contract forms. In so doing, RUS shall publish notice of rulemaking in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing, as appropriate, a revision in, or a proposal to amend § 1726.304, List of Electric Program Standard Contract Forms. The amendment may change the existing identification of a listed contract form; for example, changing the issuance date of a listed contract form or by identifying a new required contract form. The notice of rulemaking will describe the new standard contract form or the substantive change in the listed contract form, as the case may be, and the <PRTPAGE P="234"/>issues involved. The standard contract form or relevant portions thereof may be appended to the supplementary information section of the notice of rulemaking. As appropriate, the document shall provide an opportunity for interested persons to provide comments. A copy of each such <E T="04">Federal Register</E> document will be sent by regular or electronic mail to all borrowers.</P>

            <P>(a) The requirements of this part are based on contractual provisions between RUS and the organizations which receive financial assistance from RUS.</P>
            <P>(b) RUS will establish certain specifications and standards for materials, equipment, and construction units that will be acceptable for RUS financial assistance for the electric program. Materials and equipment purchased by the electric borrowers or accepted as contractor-furnished material must conform to RUS standards and specifications where they have been established and, if included in RUS Bulletin 43-5, “List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Systems of RUS Electrification Borrowers” (List of Materials), must be selected from that list or must have received technical acceptance from RUS. RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees, will evaluate certain materials, equipment and construction units, and will determine acceptance.</P>

When there are no national standards or when RUS determines that the existing national standards are not adequate for rural electric systems, RUS will prepare standards for material and equipment to be used on systems of electric borrowers. RUS standards and specifications will be codified or listed in § 1728.97, Incorporation by Reference of Electric Standards and Specifications.

            <SUBJECT>Bulletin 1728H-701, Specification for Wood Crossarms (Solid and Laminated), Transmission Timbers and Pole Keys.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) The specification in this section describes the minimum acceptable quality of wood transmission and distribution crossarms (hereinafter called arms) purchased by or for RUS borrowers. Where there is conflict between the specification in this section and any other specification referred to in this section, the specification in this section shall govern.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements of the specification in this section implement contractual provisions between RUS and borrowers receiving financial assistance from RUS. The contractual agreement between RUS and a RUS borrower requires the borrower to construct its system in accordance with RUS accepted plans and specifications. Each RUS electric and telecommunications borrower shall purchase only arms produced in accordance with the specification in this section. Each RUS electric and telecommunications borrower shall require a written confirmation from their selected contractor that all material utilized shall be produced in accordance with the specifications in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General stipulations.</E> (1) Conformance of arms to RUS specifications is the responsibility of the producer. A member of the producer's staff shall be designated as quality control supervisor and charged with the responsibility for the exercise of proper quality control procedures throughout the production process. The primary responsibility of third-party inspection agencies is to verify that producers involved in the manufacture of RUS treated wood products have functional in-house quality control systems in place that result in the shipment of materials meeting applicable RUS specification requirements to borrowers.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Treated wood products intended for RUS borrowers shall not be inspected when in the opinion of the inspector, unsafe conditions are present.</P>
            <P>(3) Various requirements relating to quality control and inspection that are contained in § 1728.202 and ANSI O5.2 and ANSI O5.3 (both incorporated by reference in § 1728.97) shall be followed exactly and shall not be interpreted or subject to judgment by the producer's quality control personnel or by the third party inspector.</P>
            <P>(4) The requirements of AWPA M3 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97) pertaining to record keeping, pre-treatment storage, analytical laboratories, plant gauges and other plant facilities, shall be followed.</P>
            <P>(5) The producer shall maintain its own properly staffed and equipped analytical laboratory or contract with an independent testing laboratory at or near the treating plant to provide the required analytical service. On a case-by-case basis, with written permission from RUS, a producer with more than one treatment facility may be allowed to use a central laboratory.</P>
            <P>(6) Arms can be purchased under either of two purchase plans; a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan or an Independent Inspection Plan. The method of inspection described in this section shall be used no matter which plan timber products are purchased under.</P>
            <P>(7) All third-party inspectors involved in the inspection of RUS products shall maintain their impartiality when providing their inspection service. This requires that these individuals and their employers, as well as producers and suppliers involved in providing RUS borrowers with treated wood products, maintain a professional separation during the performance of their respective functions to eliminate any possible conflict of interest.</P>
            <P>(8) With the exception of financial agreements for inspection services, inspection agencies shall neither accept nor provide gratuities or free services to suppliers.</P>
            <P>(9) Inspection agencies shall not offer product warranties on inspected material.</P>
            <P>(10) Arms shall be warranted to conform to this specification. Arms shall meet or exceed their minimum allowable dimensions for at least one year from time of delivery to the borrower. If any arm is determined to be defective or does not conform to this specification within 1 year from the date of delivery to the borrower, it shall be replaced as promptly as possible by the supplier. In the event of failure to do so, the purchaser may make such replacement and the cost of the arm, at destination, shall be recovered from the supplier.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Bulletin 1728H-702, Specification for Quality Control and Inspection of Timber Products.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) The specification in this section describes the responsibilities and procedures pertaining to the quality control by producers and pertaining to inspection of timber products produced in accordance with the following RUS specifications in § 1728.201, and poles, covered in Bulletin 1728F-700 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97) and in § 1755.97 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) Where there is conflict between the specification in this section and any other specification referred in this section, the specification in this section shall govern.</P>
            <P>(3) The specification in this section also describes and designates responsibilities of RUS borrowers in regard to their purchases under the specifications referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General stipulations.</E> (1) Conformance of poles and crossarms to RUS specifications is the responsibility of the producer. A member of the producer's staff shall be designated as quality control supervisor and charged with the responsibility for the exercise of proper quality control procedures throughout the production process. The primary responsibility of third party inspection agencies is to verify that producers involved in the manufacture of RUS treated wood products have functional in-house quality control systems in place that result in the shipment of materials meeting applicable RUS specification requirements to borrowers.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements of AWPA M3 (incorporated by reference at § 1728.97), pertaining to recordkeeping, pretreatment storage, analytical laboratories, plant gauges, and other plant facilities, shall be followed.</P>
            <P>(3) Treated wood products intended for RUS borrowers shall not be inspected when in the opinion of the inspector, unsafe conditions are present.</P>
            <P>(4) Poles and crossarms can be purchased under either of two purchase plans; a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan or an Independent Inspection Plan. The method of inspection described in this section shall be used no matter which plan timber products are purchased under.</P>
            <P>(5) Under the Independent Inspection Plan, the borrower should designate in the purchase order which inspection agency it has selected. Unless the borrower contracts for inspection as a separate transaction, the treating company shall obtain the services of the borrower's designated inspection agency. For reserve treated stock held in inventory by the producer, the producer shall obtain the services of the appropriate inspection program.</P>
            <P>(6) All third-party inspectors involved in the inspection of RUS products shall maintain their impartiality when providing their inspection service. This requires that these individuals and their employers, as well as producers and suppliers involved in providing RUS borrowers with treated wood products, maintain the greatest degree of professional separation during the performance of their respective functions to eliminate any possible conflict of interest.</P>
            <P>(7) With the exception of financial agreements for inspection services, inspection agencies shall not accept nor provide gratuities or free services to suppliers.</P>
            <P>(8) Inspection agencies shall not offer product warranties on inspected material.</P>
            <P>(9) Inspection agencies shall have and maintain liability insurance in the amount of $500,000 and a surety bond or miscellaneous Errors and Omission insurance for consequential damages for not less than $250,000. Evidence of compliance to the requirement in this paragraph (b)(9) shall be forwarded to the RUS annually. The evidence shall be in the form of a certificate of insurance or a Bond signed by a representative of the insurance or Surety Bonding company and include a provision that no change in, or cancellation of, will be made without the prior written notice to Chairman, Technical Standards Committee “A” (Electric).</P>

            <P>(10) Inspection agencies shall maintain their own properly equipped laboratory that, at a minimum, is able to run the referee methods listed in table 1 to this paragraph (b)(10) for retention <PRTPAGE P="256"/>analysis for all preservatives being inspected. This laboratory shall be independent from any treating plant laboratory. Inspection Agencies may use one central laboratory. All XRF units maintained by third party inspection agencies as part of their RUS required laboratories shall be calibrated at least quarterly by said agency utilizing the referee method for each preservative treatment being analyzed or via comparison with a set of graduated treated wood standards. Each agency shall keep an up-to-date written record of these quarterly calibration results. AWPA A83 (incorporated by reference at § 1728.97) shall be followed for Pentachlorophenol testing, AWPA A6 (incorporated by reference at § 1728.97) shall be followed for Creosote testing and AWPA A9 (incorporated by reference at § 1728.97) shall be followed for XRF be followed, as illustrated in the following table:</P>

            <P>(11) If used for analysis, plant XRF units shall be accurate and generate reproducible results per AWPA A9. At least once monthly, their accuracy and precision shall be checked by the third-party inspector. This verification shall consist of the inspector taking a retention sample previously analyzed by the plant quality control supervisor on-site and rerunning it in the inspection agency's own laboratory using said agency's XRF unit or the referee method for a specific preservative. If the inspection agency's analytical result is within +5% of the plant's retention result on that sample, the plant XRF unit needs no further calibration.</P>
            <P>(12) Individual inspectors in the employ of inspection agencies shall be properly trained and experienced. See § 1728.203, for details of an inspector's minimum qualifications. Upon request, inspection agencies must provide RUS with detailed written documentation verifying that each of their employees inspecting RUS materials has the minimum experience and training described in § 1728.203. Failure of an individual inspector to follow proper procedures or failure of an inspection agency to properly train and supervise their inspectors or follow applicable RUS specifications constitutes grounds for RUS debarment of said inspector and said inspection agency from future inspection of RUS financed material.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Quality control and inspection procedures.</E> It is the responsibility of the plant quality control supervisor to perform the following procedures to ensure that a particular lot of material conforms to the requirements of the applicable Agency specification prior to treatment. After the plant quality control supervisor has performed these procedures, a particular lot of material shall be released to the inspector for verification of conformance.</P>
            <P>(1) For poles, inspection prior to treatment shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) Ample space and assistance shall be provided by the treating plant for handling and turning poles. Regardless of the purchase plan poles are being purchased under, all poles in a lot shall be inspected by the plant quality control supervisor prior to offering the lot for verification by a third party.</P>
            <P>(ii) When limited by the purchaser in a written purchase order, moisture content shall be measured with a calibrated electronic moisture meter. Calibration of the moisture meter shall include not only the zero settings for the X and Y readings, but also two resistance standards for 12 and 22 percent moisture content. Material failing to conform for moisture content may be retested upon request after recalibration of the moisture meter.</P>

            <P>(iii) Dimensions, length, and circumference shall be measured by a standard steel tape to determine that they meet specification requirements and that they agree with the details for class and length found in the face brand/tag and butt of each pole. If it is obvious by visual comparison with a measured pole that the brand information regarding class and length is correct, individual poles need not be measured. Pole circumference dimensions <PRTPAGE P="257"/>measured prior to treatment shall govern acceptance. Reduction in dimension due to treatment and shipping shall be no more than 2 percent below the minimum for the pole class.</P>
            <P>(iv) Poles in a lot shall be of the same seasoning condition and all shall be inspected for decay. If the plant quality control supervisor suspects that decay is present in a pole, a slice from both ends shall be cut for closer examination. If 3 percent or more of the poles in the lot inspected by the plant quality control supervisor show evidence of decay, the entire lot shall be unconditionally withdrawn without further sorting.</P>
            <P>(v) Under the Independent Inspection Plan, all poles shall be examined by the third-party Inspector for verification of conformance. Under a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan, the number of poles inspected for verification of conformance may vary according to the terms of the approved plan.</P>
            <P>(vi) Whenever it becomes evident during third party inspection of any lot of poles offered by the producer that non-conforming pieces exceed 3 percent for any one defect or 5 percent for all defects, the inspector shall withhold further inspection and reject the balance of the lot. After the producer has acted to eliminate all defective pieces, the rejected balance may be inspected as a new lot. Sorting, however, shall not be permitted when a lot has been rejected for decay.</P>
            <P>(vii) Re-examination for mechanical damage or deterioration and for original acceptance shall be conducted on timber products not treated within 10 days after the original third-party inspection.</P>
            <P>(2) For crossarms, inspection prior to treatment shall include:</P>

            <P>(i) Regardless of the purchase plan arms are being purchased under, all arms in a lot shall be inspected by the plant quality control supervisor prior to offering the lot for verification by a third party. <E T="03">After</E> the plant quality control supervisor has performed the procedures in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (vii) of this section, a particular lot of arms shall be released to the inspector for verification of conformance.</P>
            <P>(ii) Moisture content of the arms in the lot shall be checked with a calibrated moisture meter.</P>
            <P>(iii) Surface inspection of both ends and the side surfaces of each arms. Particular attention shall be paid to visible defects such as compression wood, red heart, honeycomb and other forms of decay, shakes, splits, through checks, low density, wane, undersize, and pitch pockets.</P>
            <P>(iv) Inspection of bolt and insulator pin holes for proper location, dimension and excessive splintering.</P>
            <P>(v) Inspection of brands for proper location, required content and legibility.</P>
            <P>(vi) Under the Independent Inspection, both ends of all crossarms and a random representative sample of the lengthwise side faces of all crossarms shall be inspected. The sample size shall equal 20 percent of the lot size or 200 arms, whichever is smaller. Under a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan, the number of crossarms inspected for verification of conformance may vary according to the terms of the approved plan.</P>
            <P>(vii) Whenever it becomes evident during third party inspection of any lot of arms offered by the producer that non-conforming pieces exceed 2 percent of the sample size, the entire lot shall be rejected. After the producer has acted to eliminate all defective pieces, the rejected balance may be inspected as a new lot.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Preservatives.</E> Creosote, waterborne preservatives, pentachlorophenol and copper naphthenate shall conform to current AWPA U1 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Results of treatment—Poles.</E> (1) Following treatment, poles shall be sampled for preservative retention and penetration utilizing a calibrated increment borer 0.2 inches +0.02 inches in diameter in accordance with procedures listed in AWPA M2 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97).</P>

            <P>(2) Inspectors may take their own retention samples and analyze them concurrently with those taken by the quality control supervisor, but each shall work independently. The results of the plant's analysis shall be presented before verification and acceptance of the charge by the third-party inspector.<PRTPAGE P="258"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Unless otherwise specified, borings shall be taken from the section of the pole extending from 1 foot below the face brand/tag to 1 foot above the face brand/tag. For pressure treated Western Red Cedar, Alaska Yellow Cedar and all butt treated poles, borings shall be taken from the section of the pole approximately 1 foot below groundline.</P>
            <P>(4) For all species, core samples shall be taken from 20 poles in charges of 20 or more poles. If a charge consists of less than 20 poles, each pole shall be bored and then individual poles shall be bored a second time to obtain a minimum of 20 core samples. Any additional borings required to obtain the required 20 core samples shall be taken in a manner that represents the lot of material with respect to variations in size, seasoning condition, or other features that may affect the results of treatment.</P>
            <P>(5) Retention and penetration samples shall consist of borings representative of pole volumes for each class and length in the charge, as illustrated in the following table:</P>

              <P>Each electric program distribution, transmission and generation borrower (as defined in § 1710.2) shall operate and maintain its system in compliance with prudent utility practice, in compliance with its loan documents, and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and orders, shall maintain its systems in good repair, working order and condition, and shall make all needed repairs, renewals, replacements, <PRTPAGE P="265"/>alterations, additions, betterments and improvements, in accordance with applicable provisions of the borrower's security instrument. Each borrower is responsible for on-going operations and maintenance programs, individually or regionally performing a system security Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (VRA), establishing and maintaining an Emergency Restoration Plan (ERP), maintaining records of the physical, cyber and electrical condition and security of its electric system and for the quality of services provided to its customers. The borrower is also responsible for all necessary inspections and tests of the component parts of its system, and for maintaining records of such inspections and tests. Each borrower shall budget sufficient resources to operate and maintain its system and annually exercise its ERP in accordance with the requirements of this part. An actual manmade or natural event on the borrowers system in which a borrower utilizes a significant portion of its ERP shall count as an annual exercise for that calendar year, provided that after conclusion of the event, the borrower verifies accuracy of the emergency points-of-contact (POC) and the associated contact numbers as listed in their ERP. For portions of the borrower's system that are not operated by the borrower, if any, the borrower is responsible for ensuring that the operator is operating and maintaining the system properly in accordance with the operating agreement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Inspections and tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each borrower shall conduct all necessary inspections and tests of the component parts of its electric system, annually exercise its ERP, and maintain records of such inspections and tests. For the purpose of this part, “Exercise” means a borrower's Tabletop execution of, or actual implementation of, the ERP to verify the operability of the ERP. Such Exercise may be performed singly by an individual borrower, or as an active participant in a multi-party (to include utilities, government agencies and other participants or combination thereof) Tabletop execution or actual full implementation of the ERP. For the purpose of this part, “Tabletop” means a hypothetical emergency response scenario in which participants will identify the policy, communication, resources, data, coordination, and organizational elements associated with an emergency response.</P>
              <P>(b) The frequency of inspection and testing will be determined by the borrower in conformance with applicable laws, regulations, national standards, and Prudent Utility Practice. The frequency of inspection and testing will be determined giving due consideration to the type of facilities or equipment, manufacturer's recommendations, age, operating environment and hazards to which the facilities are exposed, consequences of failure, and results of previous inspections and tests. The records of such inspections and tests will be retained in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and Prudent Utility Practice. The retention period should be of a sufficient time period to identify long-term trends. Records must be retained at least until the applicable inspections or tests are repeated.</P>

              <P>(c) Inspections of facilities must include a determination of whether the facility complies with the National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical Code (as applicable), and applicable State or local regulations and whether additional security measures are considered necessary to reduce the vulnerability of those facilities which, if damaged or destroyed, would severely impact the reliability and security of the electric power grid, cause significant risk to the safety and health of the public and/or impact the ability to provide service to consumers over an extended period of time. The electric power grid, also known as the transmission grid, consists of a network of electrical lines and related facilities, including certain substations, used to connect distribution facilities to generation facilities, and includes bulk transmission and subtransmission facilities as defined in § 1710.2 of this title. Any serious or life-threatening deficiencies shall be promptly repaired, disconnected, or isolated in accordance with applicable codes or regulations. Any other deficiencies found as a result <PRTPAGE P="266"/>of such inspections and tests are to be recorded and those records are to be maintained until such deficiencies are corrected or for the retention period required by paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is longer.</P>

              <P>(a) Each borrower shall periodically analyze and document its security, operations and maintenance policies, practices, and procedures to determine if they are appropriate and if they are being followed. The records of inspections and tests are also to be reviewed and analyzed to identify any trends which could indicate deterioration in the physical or cyber condition or the operational effectiveness of the system or suggest a need for changes in security, operations or maintenance policies, practices and procedures. For portions of the borrower's system that are not operated by the borrower, if any, the borrower's written analysis would also include a review of the operator's performance under the operating agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) When a borrower's security, operations and maintenance policies, practices, and procedures are to be reviewed and evaluated by RUS, the borrower shall:</P>

              <P>RUS will initiate and conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the operations and maintenance practices of each borrower for the purpose of assessing loan security and determining borrower compliance with RUS policy as outlined in this part. This review will normally be done at least once every three years. The borrower will make available to RUS the borrower's policies, procedures, and records related to the operations and maintenance of its complete system. Reports made by other inspectors (e.g., other Federal agencies, State inspectors, etc.) will also be made available, as applicable. RUS will not duplicate these other reviews but will use their reports to supplement its own review. RUS may inspect facilities, as well as records, and may also observe construction and maintenance work in the field. Key borrower personnel responsible for the facilities being inspected are to accompany RUS during such inspections, unless otherwise determined by RUS. RUS personnel may prepare an independent summary of the operations and maintenance practices of the borrower. The borrower's management will discuss this review and evaluation with its Board of Directors.</P>

              <P>(a) For any items on the RUS Form 300 rated unsatisfactory (i.e., 0 or 1) by the borrower or by RUS, the borrower shall prepare a corrective action plan (CAP) outlining the steps (both short term and long term) the borrower will take to improve existing conditions and to maintain an acceptable rating. The CAP must include a time schedule and cost estimate for corrective actions, and must be approved by the borrower's Board of Directors. The CAP must be submitted to RUS for approval within 90 days after the completion of RUS' evaluation noted in § 1730.24.</P>

              <P>(b) The borrower must periodically report to RUS in writing progress under the CAP. This report must be submitted to RUS every six months <PRTPAGE P="267"/>until all unsatisfactory items are corrected unless RUS prescribes a different reporting schedule.</P>

Such certification shall be in form and substance satisfactory to RUS and shall be prepared by a professional engineer satisfactory to RUS. If RUS determines that the Engineer's Certification discloses a need for improvements to the condition of its system or any other operations of the borrower, the borrower shall, upon notification by RUS, promptly undertake to accomplish such improvements.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency Restoration Plan certification.</E> The borrower's Manager or Chief Executive Officer shall provide written certification to RUS stating that a VRA has been satisfactorily completed that meets the criteria of § 1730.27 (a), (b), (c), or (d), as applicable and § 1730.27(e)(1) through (e)(8), and that the borrower has an ERP that meets the criteria of § 1730.28 (a), (b), (c), or (d), as applicable, and § 1730.28 (e), (f), and (g). The written certification shall be in letter form. Applicants for new RUS electric loans, loan guarantees or grants shall include the written certification in the application package submitted to RUS. If the self-certification of an ERP and VRA are not received as set forth in this section, approval of the loan, loan guarantees or grants will not be considered until the certifications are received by RUS.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The purpose of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Loan and Grant Program is to encourage and improve telemedicine services and distance learning services in rural areas through the use of telecommunications, computer networks, and related advanced technologies by students, teachers, medical professionals, and rural residents. This subpart describes the general policies for administering the DLT program. Subpart B of this part contains the policies and procedures related to grants; subpart C contains the policies and procedures related to a combination loan and grant; and subpart D contains the policies and procedures related to loans.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The transmission of information is vital to the economic development, education, and health of rural Americans. To further this objective, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) will provide financial assistance to distance learning and telemedicine projects that will improve the access for people residing in rural areas to educational, learning, training, and health care services.</P>
              <P>(b) In providing financial assistance, RUS will give priority to rural areas that it believes have the greatest need for distance learning and telemedicine services. RUS believes that generally the need is greatest in areas that are economically challenged, costly to serve, and experiencing outward migration. This program is consistent with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that designate telecommunications service discounts for schools, libraries, and rural health care centers. RUS will take into consideration the community's involvement in the proposed project and the applicant's ability to leverage grant funds.</P>
              <P>(c) In administering this subpart, RUS will not favor or mandate the use of one particular technology over another.</P>
              <P>(d) Rural institutions are encouraged to cooperate with each other, with applicants, and with end-users to promote the program being implemented under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(e) RUS staff will make diligent efforts to inform potential applicants in rural areas of the programs being implemented under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="273"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may provide loans under this subpart to an entity that has received a telecommunications or electric loan under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. A borrower receiving a loan shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Make the funds provided available to entities that qualify as distance learning or telemedicine projects satisfying the requirements of this subpart, under any terms it so chooses as long as the terms are no more stringent than the terms under which it received the financial assistance.</P>
              <P>(2) Use the loan to acquire, install, improve, or extend a distance learning or telemedicine system referred to in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(g) The Administrator will allocate funds that are appropriated each fiscal year for subparts B, C, and D, of this part respectively. Not more than 30 days before the end of the fiscal year, the Administrator may transfer any funds not committed to grants in the combination loan and grant program to the grant program.</P>
              <P>(h) Financial assistance may be provided for end user sites. Financial assistance may also be provided for hubs located in rural or non-rural areas if they are necessary to provide distance learning or telemedicine services to rural residents at end user sites.</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator will publish, at the end of each fiscal year, a notice on the RUS Telecommunications Program Web site of all applications receiving financial assistance under this subpart. Subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), applications will be available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250.</P>

If the applicant agrees to lower its grant request, it must certify that the purposes of the project can be met, and the Administrator must determine the project is financially feasible at the lower amount in accordance with § 1734.25(e). An applicant or multiple applicants affected under this paragraph will have the opportunity to be considered for loan financing in accordance with subparts C and D of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS will not approve a grant if RUS determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant's proposal does not indicate financial feasibility or is not sustainable in accordance with the requirements of § 1734.25(e);</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant's proposal indicates technical flaws, which, in the opinion of RUS, would prevent successful implementation, operation, or sustainability of the project;</P>
              <P>(3) Other applications would provide more benefit to rural America based on a review of the financial and technical information submitted in accordance with § 1734.25(e).</P>
              <P>(4) Any other aspect of the applicant's proposal fails to adequately address any requirement of this subpart or contains inadequacies which would, in the opinion of RUS, undermine the ability of the project to meet the general purpose of this subpart or comply with policies of the DLT Program contained in § 1734.2.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS may reduce the amount of the applicant's grant based on insufficient program funding for the fiscal year in which the project is reviewed. RUS will discuss its findings informally with the applicant and make every effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the applicant. Any discussions with the applicant and agreements made with regard to a reduced grant amount will be confirmed in writing.</P>

              <P>(a) Loans made or guaranteed by the Administrator of RUS will be made in conformance with the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act), as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and 7 CFR chapter XVII. RUS provides borrowers with specialized and technical accounting, engineering, and other managerial assistance in the construction and operation of their facilities when necessary to aid in the development of rural telephone service and to protect loan security. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) makes loans to:</P>
              <P>(1) Furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas; and</P>
              <P>(2) To finance facilities and equipment which expand, improve or provide:</P>
              <P>(i) 911 access;</P>
              <P>(ii) Integrated interoperable emergency communications, including multiuse networks that provide commercial or transportation information services in addition to emergency communications services;</P>
              <P>(iii) Homeland security communications;</P>
              <P>(iv) Transportation safety communications; or</P>
              <P>(v) Location technologies used outside an urbanized area.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS will not make hardship loans, RUS cost-of-money loans, or RTB loans for any wireline local exchange service or similar fixed-station voice service that, in RUS' opinion, is inconsistent with the borrower achieving the requirements stated in the State's telecommunication modernization plan within the time frame stated in the plan (see 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B), unless RUS has determined that achieving the requirements as stated in such plan is not technically or economically feasible.</P>
              <P>(c) A borrower receiving a loan to provide mobile telecommunications services or special telecommunications services shall be considered to be participating in the state telecommunications plan (TMP) with respect to the particular loan so long as the loan funds are not used in a manner that, in RUS' opinion, is inconsistent with the borrower achieving the goals set forth in the plan, except that a borrower must comply with any portion of a TMP made applicable to the borrower by a state commission with jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS will not deny or reduce a loan or an advance of loan funds based on a borrower's level of general funds.</P>
              <P>(e) No fees or charges are assessed for any type of loan or guarantee provided by RUS or the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB).</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may use consultants funded by the borrower for financial, legal, engineering, and other technical advice in connection with the review of a borrower's loan application.</P>
              <P>(g) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, rural areas means any area that is not located within a city, town, or incorporated area that has a population of greater than 20,000 inhabitants or within an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants. For the purpose of the definition of rural area,</P>
              <P>(1) The population figure is obtained from the most recent decennial Census of the United States (decennial Census). If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data; and</P>
              <P>(2) An urbanized area means a densely populated territory as defined in the most recent decennial Census.</P>

              <P>Borrowers must make adequate telephone service available to the widest practical number of rural subscribers during the life of the loan. Both the nature of the service area and the cost per subscriber must be fully considered. The borrower must seek to provide service to all interested potential subscribers in the service area.

              <P>(a) In states having a state regulatory body with authority to regulate telephone service and to require certificates of convenience and necessity, the borrower must obtain such a certificate before RUS will make a loan. Facilities or services not specifically covered by such certificate will be subject to the provisions of § 1735.12(b).</P>
              <P>(b) In states where there is no such regulatory body, a loan will not be made unless the Administrator determines that no duplication of lines, facilities, or systems already providing reasonably adequate services shall result from such a loan.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS shall consider the following criteria for any wireline local exchange service or similar fixed-station voice service provided by a local exchange carrier (LEC) in determining whether such service is reasonably adequate:</P>
              <P>(1) The LEC is providing area coverage as described in § 1735.11.</P>

              <P>(2) The LEC is providing all one-party service or, if the State commission has mandated a lower grade of service, the LEC is eliminating that service in accordance with the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 151 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The LEC's network is capable of providing transmission and reception of data at a rate of at least 1,000,000 bits per second (1 Mbps) with reasonable modification to any subscriber who requests it.</P>
              <P>(4) The LEC makes available custom calling features (at a minimum, call waiting, call forwarding, abbreviated dialing, and three-way calling).</P>
              <P>(5) The LEC is able to provide E911 service to all subscribers, when requested by the government entity responsible for this service.</P>
              <P>(6) The LEC is able to offer local service with blocked toll access to those subscribers who request it.</P>
              <P>(7) The LEC's network is capable of accommodating Internet access at speeds of at least 28,800 bits per second (28.8 Kbps) via modem dial-up from any subscriber location.</P>
              <P>(8) There is an absence of frequent service interruptions.</P>
              <P>(9) The LEC is interconnected with the public switched network.</P>

              <P>(11) Services are provided at reasonably affordable rates.</P>
              <P>(12) Any other criteria the Administrator determines to be applicable to the particular case.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS shall consider the following criteria for any of mobile telecommunications service in determining whether such service is reasonably adequate:</P>

              <P>(1) The extent to which area coverage is being provided as described in 7 CFR 1735.11.<PRTPAGE P="302"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Clear and reliable call transmission is provided with sufficient channel availability.</P>
              <P>(3) The mobile telecommunications service signal strength is at least −85dBm (decibels expressed in miliwatts).</P>
              <P>(4) The mobile telecommunications service is interconnected with the public switched network.</P>
              <P>(5) Mobile 911 service is available to all subscribers, when requested by the local government entity responsible for this service.</P>
              <P>(6) No Federal or State regulatory commission having jurisdiction has determined that the quality, availability, or reliability of the service provided is inadequate.</P>
              <P>(7) Mobile telecommunications service is not provided at rates which render the service unaffordable to a significant number of rural persons.</P>
              <P>(8) Any other criteria the Administrator determines to be applicable to the particular case.</P>
              <P>(e) RUS does not consider mobile telecommunications service a duplication of existing wireline local exchange service or similar fixed-station voice service. RUS may finance mobile telecommunications systems designed to provide eligible services in rural areas under the Rural Electrification Act even though the services provided by the system may incidentally overlap services of existing mobile telecommunications providers.</P>
              <P>(f) RUS shall consider the following criteria for any provider of a specialized telecommunications service in determining whether such service is reasonably adequate:</P>
              <P>(1) The provider of a specialized telecommunications service is providing area coverage as described in § 1735.11.</P>
              <P>(2) An adequate signal strength is provided throughout the largest practical portion of the service area.</P>
              <P>(3) There is an absence of frequent service interruptions.</P>
              <P>(4) The quality and variety of service provided is comparable to that provided in nonrural areas.</P>
              <P>(5) The service provided complies with industry standards.</P>
              <P>(6) No Federal, State, or local regulatory commission having jurisdiction has determined that the quality, availability, or reliability of the service provided is inadequate.</P>
              <P>(7) Services are provided at reasonably affordable rates.</P>
              <P>(8) Any other criteria the Administrator determines to be applicable to the particular case.</P>
              <P>(g) RUS shall consider the following criteria for loans made for the purposes described in § 1735.10(a)(2):</P>
              <P>(1) In making a preliminary assessment and a credit decision, the RUS will take into consideration the extent to which the emergency communications capability or emergency communications benefits already exist in the affected area and the need expressed by the proposed user of the emergency communications technology.</P>
              <P>(2) The RUS will not consider an application to finance an upgrade of 911 capabilities or other emergency communications capability by different providers serving the same geographic area to be automatically duplicative. For example, RUS will generally not consider an application from two competing wireless carriers to upgrade their E911 capabilities in overlapping geographic territories to be duplicative, however the carrier's competitive situation will be a relevant consideration in evaluating the ability of a service provider to repay their loan.</P>
              <P>(3) Duplication considerations will be reviewed on the basis of the emergency communications benefit; the Agency encourages applicants to fully embrace interoperability to maximize the impact of RUS financed investments. In the case of dual or multi-use technologies, the extent to which the proposed non-emergency communications benefits are available from other providers within the proposed service area will be considered in determining loan feasibility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Location of facilities and service for nonrural subscribers.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) When it is determined by the Administrator to be necessary in order to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas, loans may be made for the improvement, expansion, construction, <PRTPAGE P="303"/>acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems without regard to their geographical location.</P>
              <P>(b) To the greatest extent practical, loans are limited to providing telephone facilities that serve subscribers in rural areas. In order to furnish and improve service to rural subscribers it may at times be necessary to provide loan funds to finance telephone facilities which (1) will also serve nonrural subscribers, or (2) are located in nonrural areas. Loans may be approved to finance such facilities if the Administrator determines, on a case-by-case basis, that (i) the primary purpose of the loan is to provide service to rural areas and (ii) the financing of facilities for nonrural subscribers is necessary and incidental to furnishing or improving telephone service in rural areas.</P>
              <P>(c) Loan funds may be approved for facilities to serve nonrural subscribers only if (1) the principal purpose of the loan is to furnish and improve rural service and (2) the use of loan funds to serve nonrural subscribers is necessary and incidental to the principal purpose of the loan. The following are examples of purposes for which such loans may be made (such loans are not limited to these examples):</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of construction of a new system, if the loan would not be economically feasible and self-liquidating unless the nonrural as well as the rural portions of the telephone service area are included in the proposed system, the loan may include funds for both portions.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the acquisition of an existing system located in and serving a nonrural area is necessary to serve as the nucleus of an expanded system to furnish area coverage service in rural areas, the loan may include funds to finance the acquisition.</P>
              <P>(3) When a system is being converted to modern service for rural subscribers, the loan may include funds for the conversion of the nonrural facilities, if the rural service will be improved as a result of such nonrural improvements and it is impractical to finance and serve the nonrural and rural areas separately.</P>
              <P>(4) A loan may include funds to serve nonrural subscribers located in community centers frequently called by the rural subscribers if the construction to serve such nonrural subscribers will be incidental to, and contribute substantially to, the provision of adequate service for the rural subscribers.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS may also approve financing for facilities to serve nonrural areas if, at the time financing was first approved by RUS:</P>
              <P>(1) The nonrural area had a population of 1,500 or less when first financed by RUS and that financing was approved prior to November 1, 1993; or</P>
              <P>(2) The nonrural area had a population of 5,000 or less when first financed by RUS and that financing was approved on or after November 1, 1993.</P>

              <P>(a) RUS makes hardship and guaranteed loans to finance the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of systems or facilities (including station apparatus owned by the borrower, headquarters facilities, and vehicles not used primarily in construction) to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas, except as noted under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) RUS will not make any type of loan to finance the following items:</P>

              <P>(a) RUS makes loans only if, in the judgment of the Administrator, the security therefor is reasonably adequate and the loan will be repaid within the time agreed. See 7 CFR 1735.18 and 7 CFR 1735.51.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS generally requires that borrowers provide it with a first lien on all of the borrower's property. See 7 CFR 1735.46.</P>

              <P>(d) In the case of loans that include the financing of telephone facilities that do not constitute self-contained operating systems or units (such as lines switched by other systems), the borrower shall, in addition to the mortgage lien on all of the borrower's telephone facilities, furnish adequate assurance, in the form of contractual or other security arrangements, that continuous and efficient telephone service will be rendered.</P>
              <P>(e) The borrower shall provide RUS with a satisfactory Area Coverage Survey. See 7 CFR 1737.30 and 1737.31.</P>

              <P>(f) RUS makes loans only if the borrower's entire system, including the facilities to be constructed with the proceeds of the loan, is economically feasible, as determined by RUS. In addition, RUS considers a system to be feasible only if the system, in addition to being feasible in all other respects, is year 2000 compliant or if the borrower provides RUS with a certification, satisfactory to RUS, that the system will be year 2000 compliant at a reasonable <PRTPAGE P="306"/>time before December 31, 1999. <E T="03">Year 2000 compliant</E> means that product performance and function are not affected by dates before, during, and after the year 2000.</P>
              <P>(g) For purposes of determining compliance with TIER requirements, unless a borrower whose existing mortgage contains TIER maintenance requirements notifies RUS in writing differently, RUS will apply the requirements described in paragraph (g) of this section to the borrower regardless of the provisions of the borrower's existing mortgage.</P>
              <P>(h) For Loans approved after December 22, 2008, the borrower shall be required to maintain a TIER, at the end of the Forecast Period, at least equal to the projected TIER determined by the feasibility study prepared in connection with the loan, which shall be at least 1.0 and not greater than 1.5.</P>
              <P>(i) Nothing in this section shall affect any rights of supplemental lenders under the RUS mortgage, or other creditors of the borrower, to limit a borrower's TIER requirement to a level above that established in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) RUS makes hardship loans under section 305(d)(1) of the RE Act. These loans bear interest at a rate of 5 percent per year. To qualify for a hardship loan on or after November 1, 1993, a borrower must meet each of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The average number of proposed subscribers per mile of line in the service area of the borrower is not more than 4;</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower has a projected TIER (including the proposed loan or loans) of at least 1.0, but not greater than 3.0, as determined by the feasibility study prepared in connection with the loan, see 7 CFR part 1737, subpart H; and</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator has approved and the borrower is participating in a telecommunications modernization plan for the state, see 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Hardship loan funds shall not be used to finance facilities located in any exchange of the borrower that has:</P>
              <P>(i) More than 1,000 existing subscribers; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An average number of proposed subscribers per mile of line greater than 17.</P>
              <P>(2) Those facilities may, however, be financed with concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans or a guaranteed loan if the borrower is eligible for such financing.</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator may waive the TIER requirement in paragraph (a)(2) of this section in any case in which the Administrator determines, and sets forth the reasons therefor in writing, that the requirement would prevent emergency restoration of the telephone system of the borrower or result in severe hardship to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(d) In order to fairly and equitably approve hardship loans to ensure that borrowers most in need receive hardship financing first, RUS will prioritize for approval all applications qualifying for hardship loans. The criteria in this paragraph will be used by the Administrator to rank, from high to low, applications that have been determined to qualify for hardship financing. Subject to the availability of funds, applications receiving the highest number of points will be selected for loan approval each fiscal year quarter (the application with the most points will be approved first, the second highest next, etc.) The following ranking methodology and loan approval conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Ranking criteria.</E> Borrowers will receive points based on each of the following criteria applicable to the proposed loan:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Forecasted Average Number of Subscribers Per Mile of Line (Density).</E> The <PRTPAGE P="307"/>number of points assigned to a borrower will be the value 4 less the value of the borrower's forecasted density as determined by the Feasibility Study prepared in connection with the loan (i.e., if a borrower's forecasted system density is 2.75, the borrower would receive 4 less 2.75 points, or 1.25 points).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Forecasted TIER.</E> The number of points assigned to a borrower will be the value 3 less the value of the borrower's forecasted TIER as determined by the Feasibility Study prepared in connection with the loan (i.e., if a borrower's forecasted TIER is 1.75, the borrower would receive 3 less 1.75 points, or 1.25 points).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Unserved Territories.</E> Borrowers will receive points for loan funds included in the application to provide telephone service in areas previously unserved because it was considered cost prohibitive (for example, high costs resulting from the terrain, remoteness, or system design). In particular, borrowers will receive one tenth of a point, up to a maximum of 2 points, for each subscriber added (in connection with the loan) that currently resides in an unserved area.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Plant Modernization.</E> Borrowers will receive 1 point for loan funds included in the application for at least one of the following basic plant modernizations or system improvements:</P>
              <P>(A) Providing digital switching capabilities where those capabilities did not previously exist; and/or</P>
              <P>(B) Upgrading to equal access; and/or</P>
              <P>(C) Conversion of service to 1-party making an entire exchange all 1-party service.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Distance Learning and Medical Link Facilities.</E> Borrowers will receive 2 points for loan funds included in the application for the purpose of providing distance learning or medical link transmission facilities. If loan funds are included for both distance learning and medical link transmission facilities, borrowers will receive 3 points. (See 7 CFR part 1734 for definitions of distance learning and medical link.)</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Time Factor.</E> If a borrower's application has been ranked but cannot be approved due to the lack of funds available for loans in that quarter, the borrower will receive .25 points for each quarter in which its loan is pending but not approved.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ranking and approval of loans.</E> Eligible loan applications (satisfying the requirements of 7 CFR 1737.21) will be ranked during the quarter in which the application is received. If an application is received in which insufficient time remains in that quarter to process and rank the application, it will be ranked in the next quarter. At the beginning of the quarter and as soon as practical, RUS will approve all eligible hardship loans ranked in the previous quarter to the extent loan funds are available, beginning with the borrowers that received the highest number of points and working downwards. Any qualified application that is not approved due to the lack of funds will be carried forward to the next quarter and ranked with all other eligible hardship loan applications in that quarter. Upon completion of the ranking and approval of loans, all borrowers will be informed in writing of the status of their loan applications.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Optimal use of funds.</E> RUS retains the right to limit the size of hardship loans made to individual borrowers in order to more equitably distribute the amount of hardship funds appropriated among the greatest number of qualified borrowers. Generally, no more than 10 percent of the funds appropriated in any fiscal year may be loaned to a single borrower. In addition, RUS retains the right to approve loans to borrowers that are ranked lower in the priority system, or without regard to when the application was received and ranked, if it is necessary to:</P>
              <P>(1) Expedite restoration of service outages due to natural disasters; or</P>
              <P>(2) Maximize the use of all available hardship funds appropriated for loans in that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(f) On request of any borrower who is eligible for a hardship loan for which funds are not available, the borrower shall be considered to have applied for concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans under sections 305 and 408, respectively, of the RE Act.</P>

              <P>(g) Hardship loans may be made simultaneously with concurrent RUS <PRTPAGE P="308"/>cost-of-money and RTB loans or guaranteed loans.</P>

The same method would be used to calculate the RTB portion (see 7 CFR 1610.6(b)). If during the fiscal year the amount of funds appropriated changes, the ratio will be adjusted accordingly and applied only to those loans approved afterwards.</P>
              <P>(c) The RUS cost-of-money loan shall bear interest as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section (the actual rate of interest on the RTB loan shall be determined as provided in 7 CFR 1610.10):</P>
              <P>(1) Each advance of funds included in RUS cost-of-money loans shall bear interest at a rate (the “Cost of Money Interest Rate”) equal to the current cost of money to the Federal Government for loans of a similar maturity. The Cost of Money Rate is determined when the funds are advanced to the borrower but cannot exceed 7 percent per year.</P>
              <P>(2) RUS shall use the Federal Treasury Statistical Release (the “Statistical Release”) issued by the United States Treasury to determine the interest rate for each advance of RUS cost-of-money loan funds. Generally, the Statistical Release is issued each Monday to cover the preceding week. RUS shall determine the Cost of Money Interest Rate as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Each advance shall bear the interest rate stated in the applicable Statistical Release for Treasury constant maturities with a maturity similar to that of the advance.</P>
              <P>(ii) RUS shall determine the interest rate for an advance bearing a maturity other than those stated in the applicable Statistical Release by straight-line interpolation between the next higher and next lower stated maturities.</P>
              <P>(iii) The first Statistical Release published after the date of an advance shall apply to that advance.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the interest rate determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section is higher than 7 percent, then the advance shall bear interest at the rate of 7 percent per year.</P>

              <P>(v) Advances with maturities greater than 30 years shall bear interest at the <PRTPAGE P="309"/>rate stated in the applicable Statistical Release for 30-year maturities.</P>
              <P>(vi) RUS may use an alternative method to determine the Cost of Money Interest Rate if the Treasury ceases to issue the Statistical Release or changes its format or frequency of issue so that it is no longer appropriate for use in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In this eventuality, RUS shall immediately notify all borrowers with unadvanced RUS cost-of-money loan funds. RUS may, with the borrower's consent, determine the Cost of Money Interest Rate on a case-by-case basis for subsequent advances of RUS cost-of-money loan funds but may also decide, in its discretion, that it is unable to continue advancing funds until an alternative method is in effect.</P>
              <P>(vii) Refer to § 1735.43(a) for additional information on maturities of RUS loans.</P>
              <P>(viii) RUS shall provide borrowers with prompt written confirmation of the Cost of Money Interest Rate borne by each advance of funds included in a RUS cost-of-money loan.</P>

              <P>(d) Generally, no more than 10 percent of lending authority from appropriations in any fiscal year for RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans may be loaned to a single borrower. RUS will publish by notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the dollar limit that may be loaned to a single borrower in that particular fiscal year based on approved RUS and RTB lending authority.</P>
              <P>(e) On request of any borrower who is eligible for concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans for which funds are not available, the borrower shall be considered to have applied for a loan guarantee under section 306 of the RE Act.</P>
              <P>(f) Concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans may be made simultaneously with hardship loans or guaranteed loans.</P>

                    <P>(a) RUS makes cost-of-money loans, under section 305(d)(2) of the RE Act. To qualify for cost-of-money loans, a borrower must meet each of the following requirements:<STARS/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Loan guarantees under this section will be considered for only those borrowers specifically requesting a guarantee. Borrowers may also specify that the loan to be guaranteed shall be made by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). RUS provides loan guarantees pursuant to section 306 of the RE Act. Guaranteed loans may be made simultaneously with hardship loans or concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans. No fees or charges are assessed for any guarantee of a loan provided by RUS. In view of the Government's guarantee, RUS generally obtains a first lien on all assets of the borrower (see § 1735.46).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> To qualify for a guaranteed loan, a borrower must have a projected TIER (including the proposed loan or loans) of at least 1.2 as <PRTPAGE P="310"/>determined by the feasibility study prepared in connection with the loan. In addition, a borrower must meet all requirements set forth in the regulations applicable to a loan made by RUS with the exception that it is not required to participate in a state telecommunications modernization plan and is not subject to a subscriber per mile eligibility requirement, as provided in § 1735.31(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Net worth requirements.</E> RUS generally requires that borrowers seeking guaranteed loans have a net worth in excess of 20 percent of assets. RUS will, however, consider loan guarantees for borrowers with a net worth less than 20 percent.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Full amount guaranteed.</E> Loans are guaranteed in the full amount of principal and interest. Because of the Government's full faith and credit 100 percent guarantee of these loans, only RUS obtains a mortgage on the borrower's assets.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Federal Register notice.</E> After RUS has reviewed an application and determined that it shall consider guaranteeing a loan for the proposed project and if the borrower has not specified that the loan be made from the FFB, RUS shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Notice will include a description of the proposed project, the estimated total cost, the estimated amount of the guaranteed loan, a statement that the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) has a standing loan commitment agreement with RUS, and the name and address of the borrower to which financing proposals may be submitted.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Qualified lenders.</E> RUS considers loan guarantees on a case by case basis for loans made by the FFB and any other legally organized lending agency or by a combination of lenders that the Administrator determines to be qualified to make, hold and service the loan. “Legally organized lending agency” and “lender” include commercial banks, trust companies, mortgage banking firms, insurance companies, and any other institutional investor authorized by law to loan money. The borrower is responsible for evaluating all proposals received from lenders other than FFB. The borrower furnishes RUS with a report on the evaluations and its choice of proposals. However, at the request of the borrower, the guaranteed loan shall be made by the FFB.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest rate.</E> Guaranteed loans shall bear interest at the rate agreed upon by the borrower and lender. Guaranteed FFB loans shall be at a rate of interest that is not more than the rate of interest applicable to other similar loans then being made or purchased by FFB.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Condition of guarantee.</E> RUS will not guarantee a loan if the income from the loan or the income from obligations issued by the holder of the loan, when the obligations are created by the loan, is excluded from gross income for the purpose of chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Contract of guarantee.</E> If RUS is satisfied with the engineering and economic feasibility of the project and approves the borrower's choice of proposal, subject to the submission of satisfactory financing documents and to the satisfaction of other pertinent terms and conditions, RUS will prepare a contract of guarantee to be executed by the borrower, the lender, and RUS within a specified time. The lender, or its representative, shall have the right to examine the borrower's application and supporting data submitted to RUS in support of its request for financial assistance.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Loan servicing.</E> The contract of guarantee will require that arrangements satisfactory to RUS be made to service the loan. Required servicing by the lender will include:</P>
              <P>(1) Determining that all prerequisites to each advance of loan funds by the lender under the terms of the contract of guarantee, all financing documents, and all related security instruments have been fulfilled. Such determinations may be met by obtaining RUS approval of each advance.</P>
              <P>(2) Billing and collecting loan payments from the borrower.</P>

              <P>(3) Notifying the Administrator promptly of any default in the payment of principal and interest on the loan and submitting a report, as soon as possible thereafter, setting forth its views as to the reasons for the default, how long it expects the borrower will <PRTPAGE P="311"/>be in default, and what corrective actions the borrower states it is taking to achieve a current debt service position.</P>
              <P>(4) Notifying the Administrator of any known violations or defaults by the borrower under the lending agreement, contract of guarantee, or related security instruments, or conditions of which the lender is aware which might lead to nonpayment, violation, or other default.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Payments under the contract of guarantee.</E> Upon receipt of the notification required in § 1735.32(j)(3) of this section, RUS will pay the lender the amount in default with interest to the date of payment. When RUS has made a payment under a contract of guarantee, it will establish in its accounts the amount of the payment as due and payable from the borrower, with interest at the rate of interest specified in the lending agreement. RUS will work with the borrower and the lender in an effort to eliminate the borrower's default as soon as possible. RUS may also proceed with other remedies available under its security instruments.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Pledging of contract of guarantee.</E> Subject to applicable law, RUS will consider, on a case by case basis, permitting pledging of the contract of guarantee in order to facilitate the obtaining of funds by the lending agency to make the guaranteed loan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Variable interest rate loans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>After June 10, 1991, and prior to November 1, 1993, RUS made certain variable rate loans at interest rates less than 5 percent but not less than 2 percent. For those borrowers that received variable rate loans, this section describes the method by which interest rates are adjusted. The interest rate used in determining feasibility is the rate charged to the borrower until the end of the Forecast Period for that loan. At the end of the Forecast Period, the interest rate for the loan may be annually adjusted by the Administrator upward to a rate not greater than 5 percent, or downward to a rate not less than the rate determined in the feasibility study on which the loan was based, based on the borrower's ability to pay debt service and maintain a minimum TIER of 1.0. Downward and upward adjustments will be rounded down to the nearest one-half or whole percent. To make this adjustment, projections set forth in the loan feasibility study will be revised annually by RUS (beginning within four months after the end of the Forecast Period) to reflect updated revenue and expense factors based on the borrower's current operating condition. Any such adjustment will be effective on July 1 of the year in which the adjustment was determined. If the Administrator determines that the borrower is capable of meeting the minimum TIER requirements of § 1735.22(f) at a loan interest rate of 5 percent on a loan made as described in this section, then the loan interest rate shall be fixed, for the remainder of the loan repayment period, at the standard interest rate of 5 percent.</P>

              <EXT-XREF HREF="20191107" REFID="10">Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 59921, Nov. 7, 2019.</EXT-XREF>
              <P>(a) Except as described in this paragraph (a), RUS loans approved after October 6, 1997 must be repaid with interest within a period that, rounded to the nearest whole year, equals the expected composite economic life of the facilities to be financed, as calculated by RUS; expected composite economic life means the depreciated life plus three years. The expected composite economic life shall be based on the depreciation rates for the facilities financed by the loan. In states where the borrower must obtain state regulatory commission approval of depreciation rates, the depreciation rates used shall be the rates currently approved by the state commission or rates for which the borrower has received state commission approval. In cases where a state regulatory commission does not approve depreciation rates, the expected composite economic life shall be based on the most recent median depreciation rates published by RUS for all borrowers (see 7 CFR 1737.70). Borrowers may request a repayment period that is longer or shorter than the expected composite economic life of the facilities financed. If the Administrator determines that a repayment period based on the expected composite economic life of the facilities financed is likely to cause the borrower to experience hardship, the Administrator may agree to approve a period longer than requested. A shorter period may be approved as long as the Administrator determines that the loan remains feasible.</P>
              <P>(b) Borrowers with RTB loans approved after October 6, 1997 with a maturity that exceeds the expected composite economic life of the facilities to be financed by the loan by a period of more than three years, release of funds included in the loan shall be conditioned upon the borrower establishing and maintaining, pursuant to a plan approved by RUS, a funded reserve in such an amount that the balance of the reserve plus the value of the facilities less depreciation shall at all times be at least equal to the remaining principal payments on the loan. Funding of the reserve must begin within one year of approval of release of funds and must continue regularly over the expected composite economic life of the facilities financed.</P>

              <P>(c) Borrowers that have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator an inability to maintain the funded reserve or net plant to secured debt ratio requirements, if any, contained in their mortgage, may elect to replace notes with an original maturity that exceeded the composite economic life of the facilities financed with notes bearing a shorter maturity approximating the expected composite economic life of the facilities financed, if this will result in a shorter maturity for the loan. The principal balance of the notes (hereinafter in this section called the “refunding notes”) issued to refund and substitute for the original notes would be the unpaid principal balance of the original notes. The refunding notes would mature at a date no later than the remaining economic life of the facilities financed by the loan, plus three years, as determined by the original feasibility study prepared in connection with the loan. Interest on the original note must continue to be paid through the closing date. All other payment terms, including the rate of interest on the refunding notes, would remain unchanged. Disposition of funds in the funded reserve will be determined by RUS at the closing date. RUS will notify the borrower in writing of the amendment of <PRTPAGE P="313"/>loan payment requirements and the terms and conditions thereof.</P>
              <P>(d) A borrower qualifying under paragraph (c) of this section shall not be required to pay a prepayment premium on such portion of the payments under its new notes as exceeds the payments required under the notes being replaced.</P>
              <P>(e) To apply for refunding notes, borrowers must send to the Area Office the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A certified copy of a board resolution requesting an amendment of loan payment requirements and that certain notes be replaced;</P>
              <P>(2) If applicable, evidence of approval by the regulatory body with jurisdiction over the telecommunications service provided by the borrower to issue refunding notes; and</P>
              <P>(3) Such other documents as may be required by the RUS.</P>
              <P>(f) Principal and interest will be repaid in accordance with the terms of the notes. Generally, interest is payable each month as it accrues. Principal payments on each note generally are scheduled to begin 2 years after the date of the note. After this deferral period, interest and principal payments on all funds advanced during this 2-year period are scheduled in equal monthly installments. Principal payments on funds advanced 2 years or more after the date of the note will begin with the first billing after the advance. The interest and principal payments on each of these advances will be scheduled in equal monthly installments.

              <P>(a) Loans are to be repaid according to their terms. RUS generally obtains a first lien on all assets of the borrower. This lien shall be in the form of a mortgage by the borrower to the Government or a deed of trust made by and between the borrower and a trustee, satisfactory to the Administrator, together with such security agreements, financing statements, or other security documents as RUS may deem necessary in a particular case. Where a borrower is unable by reason of pre-existing encumbrances, or otherwise, to furnish a first mortgage lien on its entire system the Administrator may, if he determines such security to be reasonably adequate and the form and nature thereof otherwise appropriate, accept other forms of security. See RUS Bulletins 320-4, 320-22, 321-2, 322-2, 323-1, and 326-1 for details. See 7 CFR part 1744, subpart B for information on lien accommodations and subordinations.</P>
              <P>(b) Loan security documents of borrowers with loans approved after October 6, 1997 will provide limits on allowable cash distributions in any calendar year as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) No more than 25 percent of the prior calendar year's net earnings or margins if the borrower's net worth is at least 1 percent of its total assets after the distribution is made;</P>
              <P>(2) No more than 50 percent of the prior calendar year's net earnings or margins if the borrower's net worth is at least 20 percent of its total assets after the distribution is made;</P>
              <P>(3) No more than 75 percent of the prior calendar year's net earnings or margins if the borrower's net worth is at least 30 percent of its total assets after the distribution is made; or</P>
              <P>(4) No limit on distributions if the borrower's net worth is at least 40 percent of its total assets after the distribution is made.</P>
              <P>(c) Borrowers that have not received a loan after October 6, 1997 may request the Administrator to apply these requirements to them. Borrowers may request in writing that RUS substitute the new requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. Upon request by the borrower, the provisions of the borrower's loan documents restricting cash distributions or investments shall not be enforced to the extent that such provisions are inconsistent with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Rural development investments meeting the criteria set forth in 7 CFR part 1744, subpart D, will not be counted against a borrower's allowable cash distributions in any calendar year (7 U.S.C. 926).</P>

This finding is based on the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) Self-liquidation of the loan within the loan amortization period; this requires that there be sufficient revenues from the borrower's system, in excess of operating expenditures (including maintenance and replacement), to repay the loan with interest.</P>

              <P>(b) RUS will finance an acquisition by a borrower only when the acquisition is necessary and incidental to furnishing or improving rural telephone service and the service area is eligible for RUS assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS does not make loans for the sole purpose of merging or consolidating telephone organizations. After a merger or consolidation, RUS will consider making loans to the telephone system to finance the improvement or extension of telephone service in rural areas.</P>
              <P>(d) Generally, RUS will not make a loan for the acquisition of an existing borrower unless, in addition to all other requirements, such acquisition will improve the likelihood of repayment of an outstanding RUS loan and all outstanding balances of the previous RUS loans are paid in full.</P>
              <P>(e) In determining the amount it will lend for each acquisition, RUS shall place a valuation on all telephone facilities that are to be acquired with loan funds. RUS may consider fair market value, the original cost less depreciation of the facilities, income generating potential, any improvement in the financial strength of the borrower as a result of the acquisition, and any other factors deemed relevant by RUS to determine the reasonableness of the acquisition price and the amount of loan funds RUS will provide for an acquisition. RUS shall not consider the acquisition price reasonable or approve a loan if, in the Administrator's opinion, the acquisition price will endanger financial feasibility. If the acquisition price exceeds the amount RUS will lend, the borrower provides the remainder.</P>

              <P>(f) When a borrower intends to request RUS loan funds for an acquisition, it shall present a proposal in writing to the Area Office as soon as possible. The borrower must either obtain RUS approval prior to making any binding commitments with the seller or make the commitments subject to RUS's approval. Failure to comply with these requirements will disqualify the borrower from obtaining an RUS <PRTPAGE P="318"/>loan for the acquisition unless the Administrator determines there were extenuating circumstances.</P>

              <P>(a) A borrower may submit a written request for RUS approval of interim financing if it is necessary to close an acquisition before the loan to finance the acquisition is approved. Loan funds shall not be used to reimburse acquisition costs unless RUS has granted approval of interim financing prior to the closing of the acquisition.</P>

              <P>(c) RUS will not approve interim financing unless the following information is acceptable:</P>
              <P>(1) A written request for approval of interim financing, including a brief description of the acquisition, an explanation of the urgency of proceeding with the acquisition, and the source of funds to be used.</P>
              <P>(2) A completed RUS Form 490, “Application for Telephone Loan or Loan Guarantee.” See 7 CFR part 1737.</P>
              <P>(3) The portions of the Loan Design that cover the proposed acquisition, including cost estimates and information on any investments in nonrural areas. See 7 CFR 1737.</P>

              <P>(5) Any other data deemed necessary by the Administrator to approve the interim financing of the acquisition.</P>
              <P>(d) Furthermore, RUS will not approve interim financing if, in RUS's judgment, the proposed acquisition will not qualify for RUS financing or the proposed interim financing presents unacceptable loan security risks to RUS.</P>
              <P>(e) Because RUS approval of interim financing is not a commitment to make a loan, RUS will not approve interim financing unless the borrower is prepared to assume responsibility for financing all obligations incurred.</P>
              <P>(f) If the borrower plans to proceed with the closing after receiving RUS approval of interim financing, it must first receive preliminary approval from RUS. See § 1735.90</P>

              <SUBJECT>Area Coverage Survey (ACS).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Area Coverage Survey (ACS) is a market forecast of service requirements of subscribers in a proposed service area.</P>
              <P>(b) The objective of the ACS is to determine the location, number and telephone service requirements of subscribers in a service area. RUS will use the ACS to appraise the proposed plan for area coverage and to determine the largest practical number of rural subscribers which can be served on an economically feasible basis. Preparation of the ACS requires:</P>
              <P>(1) A field survey of the service area to locate and identify on maps all business and residential establishments, whether currently served or not. The location and identification of future establishments are also recorded on the maps.</P>
              <P>(2) A forecast of the number of telephone subscribers, in the entire service area, by exchange, grade and class of service, projected for the end of the 5-year study period.</P>
              <P>(c) The results of the survey and forecast shall be:</P>
              <P>(1) Shown on maps (maps for those service areas previously financed by RUS do not have to be included in the ACS provided that the borrower's records contain sufficient information as to subscriber development to enable cost estimates for the proposed facilities to be prepared);</P>
              <P>(2) Tabulated on RUS Form 569 “Area Coverage Survey Report,” or its equivalent; and</P>
              <P>(3) Supported by a narrative (see § 1737.32(f)(1)(ii)) containing information on the bases for the service requirement forecasts in each exchange.</P>
              <P>(d) Guidelines on preparing an ACS are provided in RUS Telecommunications Engineering and Construction Manual section 205.</P>
              <P>(e) The RUS field representative reviews and approves the borrower's ACS. The borrower should make sure this is done before proceeding with the Loan Design in order to prevent unnecessary expense should the ACS not be approved. The borrower's engineer must use the RUS-approved ACS in preparing the Loan Design.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan Design (LD).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A loan application requires supporting data collectively called a “Loan Design.” The LD contains a forecast of service requirements and a narrative with supporting exhibits. Most of the items included in the LD are similar for all loan applications. However, as noted below, there are certain additional requirements for initial loans and for any exchange areas not previously financed by RUS, and other additional requirements for subsequent loans for areas previously financed by RUS. The LD must conform to the borrower's state telecommunications modernization plan unless the borrower is seeking a guaranteed loan (for additional information concerning the plan, see 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B).</P>

              <P>(b) Because of the importance and complexity of the engineering studies necessary for the LD, it should be prepared by a competent experienced telecommunications engineer. While the LD is subject to RUS approval, the borrower's selection of an engineer to perform preloan work is not. Note: The borrower's selection of an engineer to perform postloan work <E T="03">is</E> subject to RUS approval. This should be considered when selecting a preloan engineer, if the same individual or company is to perform both services. See 7 CFR 1753.17.</P>
              <P>(c) An LD for initial loans or for any exchange areas not previously financed by RUS requires an Outside Plant Design that provides:</P>
              <P>(1) The most economical and practical design for a telephone system that meets immediate service demands; and</P>
              <P>(2) The basis for orderly expansion of the system to serve the widest practical number of rural establishments.</P>

              <P>(d) The LD for a subsequent loan (which only includes areas previously financed by RUS) does not require a detailed Outside Plant Design. The detailed Outside Plant Design for these subsequent loans may be completed for <PRTPAGE P="330"/>RUS review and approval after loan approval, but before staking is started and plans and specifications are prepared. By scheduling preparation of the outside plant design closer to preparation for construction, the need for redesign resulting from changing conditions and its attendant costs are reduced.</P>
              <P>(e) Guidelines on preparing an LD are provided in RUS Telecommunications Engineering and Construction Manual section 205.</P>
              <P>(f) The LD shall include a narrative, several exhibits, and a certification, as explained below:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Narrative.</E> This section discusses the following topics, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The purposes and amount of the proposed construction and both immediate and long range plans must be covered. The source and amount of any nonloan funds to be used for this construction must be discussed.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Subscriber data.</E> The basis for the subscriber forecast, including any unusual factors expected to influence growth, must be discussed. Reasons for growth projections which vary from historic trends must be explained.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Proposed construction.</E> All proposed construction must be described fully. Reference to the BER must be made here.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Service area.</E> For subsequent loans only, proposed construction which is not within the boundaries of prior loan projects must be discussed. New areas to be served (even if from existing exchanges) must be shown on maps submitted with the proposal.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Toll and EAS.</E> Proposed new toll or extended area service (EAS) facilities, including any changes from the existing trunking arrangements, must be described fully. Minutes of meetings and correspondence with connecting companies, and connecting company concurrences, if any, must be included.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Radio telephone service.</E> Proposed radio telephone service must be discussed. Results of studies demonstrating demand and/or need most be included as an exhibit.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Special projects.</E> Facilities involving investment in excess of $100,000 for any single subscriber must be discussed fully. Contractual arrangements with the subscriber, including a termination agreement providing for (A) the full recovery by the borrower of its capital costs of the facilities no later than the maturity date of the note representing the loan, (B) the immediate repayment of all remaining capital costs, if terminated, and (C) repayment to RUS of the outstanding amount of the special note shall be submitted. Usually a separate short-term note is prepared for loans to finance Special Projects.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Investment in nonrural areas.</E> (A) For initial loans, or loans for areas not previously financed by RUS, the borrower must fully discuss proposed improvements or expansions in an exchange serving a community over 5,000 population. The name of the community, the number of existing and projected new subscribers by grades of service within the community, detailed cost estimates of the facilities involved, and information sufficient to establish the necessity for the use of loan funds must be provided.</P>
              <P>(B) For subsequent loans, the borrower must fully discuss as specified in paragraph (f)(1)(viii)(A) of this section proposed improvements or expansions in an exchange serving a community over 5,000 population which had a population of more than 5,000 at the time the facilities to serve the community were first financed by RUS. The population determination is based on the corporate limits or boundaries of unincorporated areas in existence at the time the facilities to serve the community were first financed by RUS.</P>
              <P>(C) For subsequent loans, the borrower shall state whether the population of a community, which is currently more than 5,000, was considered rural at the time RUS first financed the facilities to serve the community. Detailed cost estimates are not required if the population was considered rural at the time RUS first financed facilities to serve the community, see 7 CFR 1735.13(d).</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">Prior loan project.</E> For subsequent loans only, the reason for and amount of additional loan funds needed to complete construction in progress which was part of a prior loan project in central office areas not included in the current LD must be discussed fully.<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
              </P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Route miles.</E> Route miles of outside plant in central office areas not shown on RUS Form 495 must be provided.</P>
              <P>(xi) <E T="03">Future plans.</E> Where the loan application is to finance part of a system-wide upgrading plan, plans for those remaining exchanges not included in the current loan proposal must be discussed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> (i) An RUS Form 569, “Area Coverage Survey Report,” or its equivalent shall be included for the total system and for each exchange in which system improvements or additions are proposed.</P>
              <P>(ii) An RUS Form 495, “Construction Cost Estimates,” or its equivalent shall be prepared for each exchange in which system improvements or additions are proposed. An explanation of the method used in developing these cost estimates must be included.</P>
              <P>(iii) RUS Form 494, “Loan Design Summary,” or its equivalent shall be prepared for each loan. This must show all expected 5-year construction costs, loan and nonloan.</P>
              <P>(iv) A schematic trunking diagram shall be included showing the number and type, length, ownership and makeup of existing and proposed toll and EAS trunks, plus transmission and traffic data for each trunk group.</P>
              <P>(v) Detailed outside plant design maps must be submitted for all central office areas of initial loan applicants and for areas not previously served by existing borrowers or financed by RUS. These design maps must be in sufficient detail to substantiate the construction cost estimates.</P>
              <P>(vi) For subsequent loans only, if a change in system boundaries is proposed, a map must be furnished showing present and proposed boundaries, and existing establishments and subscribers in the new areas.</P>
              <P>(vii) Any other special exhibits needed to support particular items in the loan proposal must be included.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Certification.</E> The following certification shall be signed by a principal of the engineering firm and the borrower:
              </P>

              <P>(a) RUS shall prepare a “Telephone Loan Budget” (RUS Form 493) showing all costs for the proposed project and the amount of loan and nonloan funds to be used. The budget shall show, as applicable, amounts for central offices, outside plant and station equipment, right-of-way procurement, land, buildings, removal costs, special projects, engineering, vehicles and work equipment, office equipment, operating funds, refinancing with loan funds, debt retirement with nonloan funds, acquisitions, and contingencies. The amounts budgeted, exclusive of prior loan reserves, generally shall be rounded to the nearest $1,000.</P>
              <P>(1) If the loan is to be made by the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) or concurrently with RTB, the budget shall include the amount required for the purchase of RTB Class B stock. This is 5 percent of the amount to be borrowed from RTB for all purposes other than the purchase of RTB Class B stock. The borrower may elect to use nonloan funds for all or part of this requirement.</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of funds included in any loan shall be limited for certain items:</P>
              <P>(i) Operating funds for working capital or current operating deficiencies shall be included only in cases of financial hardship as determined by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(ii) Contingencies shall not exceed 3 percent of the total amount of loan funds to be used for construction, engineering, operating equipment and operating funds.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS shall prepare the cost estimates based on the data in RUS Form 494, “Loan Design Summary,” and RUS Form 495, “Construction Cost Estimates,” or their equivalents, and other parts of the LD submitted by the borrower, and on other pertinent information. See subpart D of this part. The amounts included in the proposed budget shall be the estimated costs, less the value of materials and supplies on hand or acquired that can be used in the proposed construction. The cost estimates in the LD may be adjusted by RUS in consultation with the borrower. See § 1737.50(c).</P>
              <P>(c) Generally, the new loan shall be reduced by any required equity funds and funds available in reserves no longer needed for prior loan purposes to determine the proposed loan requirement.</P>
              <P>(d) When amounts are available in reserves no longer needed for prior loan purposes, RUS may, at its option, deny further advances of these funds if they will be used to finance projects in the proposed loan.</P>
              <P>(e) The budget shall also show, if applicable, the reserves for each budget item as of the date of the latest RUS Form 481, “Financial Requirement Statement,” submitted by the borrower. To ensure that sufficient funds are included in the budget to finance all proposed construction, RUS includes in the budget any funds deposited by the borrower for approved interim financing.</P>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to the requirements in 7 CFR part 1735, if loan funds are proposed for facilities to serve subscribers in nonrural areas, RUS shall allocate costs between rural and nonrural areas. This allocation will be used to determine whether the use of loan funds in nonrural areas is necessary and incidental to furnishing and improving telephone service in rural areas. Cost estimates shall be provided by the borrower in the LD. See subpart D of this part. RUS will use the following method to review the cost breakdowns and to determine their appropriateness:</P>
              <P>(1) The costs of facilities associated directly with particular subscribers shall be allocated to those subscribers.</P>
              <P>(2) The costs of facilities that serve both rural and nonrural subscribers shall be allocated based on the relative number of rural and nonrural subscribers receiving service from those facilities.</P>
              <P>(3) When a borrower's exchange that includes a nonrural community will have an extended area of service (EAS) with other exchanges of the borrower, the breakdown of subscribers and funds in the allocation for rural and nonrural areas included in the proposed loan shall show the number of rural and nonrural subscribers and the costs to serve each group, as determined per paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, in the subject exchange and in all exchanges connected by EAS.</P>
              <P>(b) If RUS determines that costs cannot be adequately allocated using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, RUS shall, on a case by case basis, allocate costs between the rural and nonrural subscribers using whatever methodology it deems reasonable. All allocations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be documented.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Description of feasibility study.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In connection with each loan RUS shall prepare a feasibility study that includes sections on consolidated loan estimates, operating statistics, projected telecommunications, plant, projected retirement computations, and projected revenue and expense estimates (including detailed estimates of depreciation and amortization expense, scheduled debt service payments, toll and access charge revenues, and local service revenues). Normally, projections will be for a 5-year period and used to determine the ability of the borrower to repay its loans in accordance with the terms thereof. RUS will not require borrowers to raise local service rates. Local service revenue projections will be based on the borrower's existing local service rates or regulatory body approved rates not yet in effect but to be implemented within the Forecast period. In the latter case, if a borrower is not required to obtain regulatory body approval for the implementation of such rates, RUS will require a resolution of the board of directors indicating when those rates will be in effect.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS makes loans only to rural telephone systems that are financially feasible. RUS shall consider the factors discussed in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section in determining feasibility.</P>
              <P>(c) The revenue and expense estimates for the feasibility study generally will be based on the borrower's operating experience provided that:</P>

              <P>(1) Adjustments are made for any nonrecurring revenues and expenses <PRTPAGE P="336"/>that are not representative of the borrower's past operations and would thus make the borrower's experience data inappropriate for the forecast; and</P>
              <P>(2) Adjustments are made for any special or new characteristics or other considerations deemed necessary by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) Depreciation expense will be determined using depreciation rates appropriate to the normal operation of the borrower, based on:</P>
              <P>(1) The borrowers regulatory body approved depreciation rates; and</P>
              <P>(2) Where such rates as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section do not exist for items which the borrower is seeking financing, the most recent median depreciation rates published by RUS for all borrowers. RUS will publish such depreciation rates annually in RUS's “Statistical Report, Rural Telephone Borrowers.”</P>
              <P>(f) Projected scheduled debt service payments will generally be based on all of the borrower's outstanding and proposed loans from RUS and all other lenders as of the end of the feasibility Forecast period (i.e. for a 5-year Forecast period, the amount of debt outstanding in year 5).</P>
              <P>(g) The financial and statistical data are derived from RUS Form 479, “Financial and Statistical Data for Telephone Borrowers,” or for initial loans, the data may be obtained from the borrower's financial statements and other reports, and from other information supplied with the completed loan applications (see 7 CFR 1737.21 and 1737.22).</P>
              <P>(h) When, in RUS's opinion, the borrower's operating experience is not adequate or the borrower's current operations are not representative, the estimates in the feasibility study normally will be developed from state and regional standards based on the experience of RUS borrowers. These standards are included in the Borrower's Statistical Profile (BSP), which is revised annually by RUS. If the borrower's operating experience is not the basis for one or more per-subscriber estimates used in the feasibility study, the estimates generally may not vary from the standard by more than 20 percent to reflect the particular characteristics of the loan applicant. Any variation from the standard shall be documented.</P>
              <P>(i) In cases where these per-subscriber standards do not represent a reasonable forecast of a particular borrower's operations (for example, when a variation greater than 20 percent is necessary), estimates based upon a special analysis of the borrower's projected operations shall be used. The special analysis will accompany the feasibility study.</P>
              <P>(j) When it is reasonably expected that a subscriber, classified as a special project, may discontinue service, a second feasibility study will be prepared, for comparison purposes, omitting revenues and expenses from this subscriber.</P>
              <P>(k) RUS may obtain and review commercially available credit reports on applicants for a loan or loan guarantee to verify income, assets, and credit history, and to determine whether there are any outstanding delinquent Federal or other debts. Such reports will also be reviewed for parties that are or propose to be joint owners of a project with a borrower.</P>
              <P>(l) If it is determined that loan feasibility cannot be proven as described in this section, the loan application will be returned to the borrower with an explanation. A borrower whose application has been returned will have 90 working days, from the date the application was returned, to revise and resubmit its application. If a revised application is not received by RUS within the 90-day period described above, the application will be canceled and a new application will need to be submitted if the borrower wishes further consideration.</P>

              <P>(a) For purposes of determining the creditworthiness of a borrower for concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans, the Administrator shall assume that the loans, if made, would bear interest at the Treasury rate on the date <PRTPAGE P="337"/>of determination as described in paragraph (b) of this section. If the Treasury rate exceeds 7 percent, the interest rate used to determine eligibility for the RUS cost-of-money loan will be 7 percent.</P>
              <P>(b) The 30-year Treasury rate will be used in all feasibility studies for loans with a final maturity of at least 30 years. A straight-line interpolation between other Treasury rates will be used to determine the rate used in feasibility studies for loans with final maturities of less than 30 years.</P>
              <P>(c) The Treasury rate will be obtained each Tuesday, or as soon as possible thereafter, from the Federal Reserve. The rate for the current week, from the column labeled “This week” in the Federal Reserve statistical release, will be used from that Wednesday through the following Tuesday.</P>
              <P>(d) As used in this section, the “date of determination” means the date of the feasibility study used in support of the loan recommendation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan approval requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In addition to requirements set forth in 7 CFR part 1735, 7 CFR part 1737 and other applicable parts of 7 CFR chapter XVII, the following are certain additional requirements that must be met before RUS will approve a loan:</P>
              <P>(1) If the borrower had 100 or more employees as of the prior December 31, it must submit the current annual Employer Information Report EEO-1, Standard Form 100, as required by the Department of Labor; see 29 CFR 1602.7 through 1602.14.</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower must be in compliance with regulations on nondiscrimination. See 7 CFR part 1790 (or RUS Bulletin 320-19).</P>

              <P>(3) For subsequent loans, RUS must determine whether the borrower's accounting records are adequate. If the records are not adequate, as determined by RUS based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or other accounting conventions as deemed necessary by RUS, a provision will be included in the loan contract requiring the borrower to improve its records to an adequate level.<PRTPAGE P="338"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The borrower must not have any receivables, loans, guarantees, investments, or other obligations that are contrary to the mortgage provisions or any RUS regulations including, but not limited to, 7 CFR part 1758 (or RUS Bulletins 320-4, 320-22, 321-2, 322-2, 323-1, or 326-1). If the borrower has any of these items, the loan contract shall contain a provision requiring that they be eliminated prior to the release of funds. See 7 CFR part 1744 for conditions under which RUS will provide a shared first lien and/or a lien accommodation for non-RUS lenders.</P>
              <P>(5) RUS must make a determination on flood insurance requirements. In accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (the “Flood Insurance Act”), RUS shall not approve financial assistance for the acquisition, construction, repair or improvement of any building or any machinery, equipment, fixtures or furnishings contained or to be contained in any such building located in an area which has been identified by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (the “Director of FEMA”) pursuant to the Flood Insurance Act as an area having special flood hazards unless:</P>
              <P>(i) Flood insurance has been made available, pursuant to the Flood Insurance Act, in the area in which the acquisition, construction, repair or improvement is proposed to occur; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The borrower has obtained flood insurance coverage with respect to such building, machinery, equipment, fixtures or furnishings as may be required pursuant to the Flood Insurance Act.
              </P>
              <FP>Accordingly, a finding shall be made on whether loan funds will be used to finance buildings, machinery, fixtures or furnishings located in an identified special flood hazard area. If loan funds are to be used in such a special flood hazard area, a provision will be included in the loan contract restricting the release of funds until all the requirements of the Flood Insurance Act have been satisfied.</FP>
              <P>(6) All environmental review requirements must be met in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>

              <P>(e) The borrower may be required to discharge indebtedness and/or to close acquisitions before advances are made for construction purposes.

If the evidence is satisfactory to RUS, RUS shall allow the remaining loan funds to be advanced in accordance with 7 CFR part 1744.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible service area.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A service area may be eligible for a broadband loan if all of the following are true:</P>
              <P>(1) The proposed funded service area is completely contained within a rural area;</P>
              <P>(2) At least 15 percent of the households in the proposed funded service area are unserved households;</P>
              <P>(3) No part of the proposed funded service area has three or more incumbent service providers; and</P>
              <P>(4) No part of the proposed funded service area overlaps with the service area of current RUS borrowers, nor the services areas of grantees that were funded by RUS.</P>
              <P>(b) Multiple service areas may be included in a single broadband loan application. Non-contiguous areas are considered separate service areas and must be treated separately for the purpose of determining service area eligibility. If non-contiguous areas within an application are determined to be ineligible, the Agency may consider the remaining areas in the application for eligibility. If an applicant fails to respond to Agency requests for additional information or modifications to remove ineligible areas, the application will be rejected.</P>
              <P>(c) If no existing broadband service provider responds to the Public Notice as described in § 1738.204(b), then the number of incumbent service providers for § 1738.102(a)(3) will be determined by using:</P>
              <P>(1) The most current National Broadband Map; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any other data regarding the availability of broadband service that the Secretary may collect or obtain through reasonable efforts.</P>
              <P>(d) If a service provider is identified by methods described in paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the Agency is unable to determine whether such provider is an incumbent service provider, as defined herein, then the Agency will request the service provider to provide information responding to the Public Notice for the loan application, demonstrating that they meet the definition for an incumbent service provider. If the service provider does not respond to the Agency's request within 30 calendar days providing the necessary information to make a determination, the provider will not be considered an incumbent service provider.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible service area exceptions for broadband facility upgrades.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Broadband borrowers that apply to upgrade existing broadband facilities in their existing service area are exempt from the requirement concerning the number of unserved households in § 1738.102(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) Incumbent service providers, including borrowers and grantees, which apply to upgrade existing broadband facilities in existing service territories are exempt from the requirement concerning the number of incumbent service providers in § 1738.102(a)(3) unless they are eligible for funding under Titles II and III of the RE Act. Eligibility requirements for entities that would be eligible under Titles II and III can be found in 7 CFR part 1735.</P>

              <P>(c) An applicant which is a borrower, grantee or incumbent service provider may submit one application to upgrade existing broadband facilities in existing service areas, which qualify for the exemptions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and to expand services at the broadband lending speed into new service areas, provided the upgrade area and the expansion area are proposed as two separate service areas <PRTPAGE P="346"/>even if the upgrade and expansion areas are contiguous.</P>
              <P>(d) The applicant will be asked to remove areas determined to be ineligible from their funding request or provide funds other than loan funds for these areas. The application will then be evaluated on the basis of what remains. The applicant may be requested to provide additional information to the Agency relating to the ineligible areas. If the applicant fails to respond, the application will be returned.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preliminary assessment of service area eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon request, the Agency will make information available to prospective applicants to allow a preliminary assessment of a proposed service area's eligibility. At a minimum, the prospective applicant will be able to determine:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the proposed service area is located in a rural area;</P>
              <P>(2) Whether the proposed service area overlaps with any part of a borrower's or grantee's service area; and</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the proposed service area overlaps with any part of a proposed service area in a pending application for a loan.</P>
              <P>(b) A preliminary assessment of service area eligibility does not account for all eligibility factors, and the situation within a proposed service area may change between the preliminary assessment and application submission. A preliminary assessment indicating that a proposed service area may be eligible does not guarantee that the area will remain eligible at the time of application.</P>

By submitting an application, the applicant acknowledges that no obligation to enter into a loan exists until actual loan documents have been executed.</P>

              <P>After an applicant is notified that the application is complete, the Agency will evaluate the application's financial and technical feasibility. Only applications that, as determined by the Agency, are technically and financially feasible will be considered for funding.</P>
              <P>(a) The Agency will determine financial feasibility by evaluating the impact of the facilities financed with the proceeds of the loan and the associated debt, the applicant's equity, market survey (if required), competitive analysis, financial information, and other relevant information in the application.</P>
              <P>(b) The Agency will determine technical feasibility by evaluating the applicant's network design and other relevant information in the application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Equity requirement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To be eligible for a loan, an applicant must demonstrate a minimum equity contribution equal to 10 percent of the requested loan amount at the time of application which must remain available at loan closing. In addition to the 10 percent minimum equity requirement, § 1738.208 provides additional cash requirements that may be required in support of the loan.</P>
              <P>(b) If the applicant does not have the required equity at the time the application is submitted, the applicant may satisfy the equity requirement at the time of application with an investor's unconditional legal commitment to cover the shortfall by providing additional equity. The additional equity must be transferred to the applicant prior to loan closing. If this option is elected, the applicant must provide evidence in the application that clearly identifies the investor's commitment to the applicant; the amount, terms, and conditions of the investment; and the investor's bank or financial statements that demonstrate its ability to fulfill its commitment. The terms and conditions of the investment must be acceptable to the Agency, but at a minimum cannot be secured by any assets of the applicant nor provide that the investment will be available when certain requirements or other thresholds are met by the applicant. The Agency will reject applications that do not provide evidence acceptable to the Agency regarding the investor's commitment.</P>

              <P>(c) For State and local government applicants, the equity requirement can be satisfied with a general obligation bond, as long as the additional equity will be available to the applicant at closing. If the equity requirement is satisfied with a general obligation bond, the broadband loan cannot be subordinate to the bond. The applicant <PRTPAGE P="351"/>must submit an opinion from its legal counsel that the applicant has the authority to issue a general obligation bond in an amount sufficient to meet the minimum equity requirement. Revenue bonds supported by the operations to be funded cannot be used to satisfy the equity requirement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Additional cash requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the Agency's financial analysis indicates that the applicant's entire operation (existing operations and new operations combined) will show an inadequate cash balance at the end of any year during the five-year forecast period, the Agency will require the applicant to obtain additional cash infusions necessary to maintain an appropriate cash balance throughout the five-year forecast period. This cash infusion would be in conjunction with the required 10 percent minimum equity position.</P>
              <P>(1) The Agency will require the applicant and its investors to:</P>
              <P>(i) Infuse additional cash to cover projected deficits for the first two years of operations at loan closing; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Enter into legal arrangements that commit them to making additional cash infusions to ensure that the operation will sustain a positive cash position on a quarterly basis throughout the five-year forecast period.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of identifying the additional cash requirement for a start-up operation or an operation that has not demonstrated positive cash flow for the two years prior to the submission date of the application, 50 percent of projected revenues for each year of the five-year forecast period will be considered to determine if an operation can sustain a positive cash position. In addition to the initial financial projections required to demonstrate financial feasibility, such applicants must complete adjusted financial projections using the reduced revenue projections in order to identify the amount of additional cash that will be required. Projections must be fully supported with assumptions acceptable to the Agency. The applicant may present evidence in its loan application that projected revenues or a portion of projected revenues are based on binding commitments and request that more than 50 percent of the projected revenues be considered for the purpose of identifying the additional cash requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of satisfying the additional cash requirements for an existing operation that has demonstrated a positive cash flow for the two fiscal years prior to the submission date of the application, 100 percent of the projected revenues for each year of the five-year forecast period will be used to determine if an operation can sustain a positive cash position, as long as these projections are fully supported with assumptions acceptable to the Agency.</P>
              <P>(4) If debt is incurred to satisfy the additional cash requirement, this debt must take a subordinate lien position to the Agency debt and must be at terms acceptable to the Agency.</P>
              <P>(b) An applicant may satisfy the additional cash requirement with an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit (LOC) satisfactory to the Agency. The LOC must be issued from a financial institution acceptable to the Agency and must remain in effect throughout the forecast period. The applicant and the Agency must both be payees under the LOC. The LOC must have payment conditions acceptable to the Agency, and it must be in place prior to loan closing. The applicant cannot secure the LOC with its assets and cannot pay for any LOC charges or fees with its funds.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Agency offers a loan to the applicant, the applicant must ensure that the additional cash infusion required in the first two years is deposited into its bank account within 120 days from the date the applicant signs the loan offer letter (see § 1738.251) and must enter into any other legal arrangements necessary to cover further projected operating deficits (or in the case of the LOC, to provide an acceptable LOC to the Agency) prior to closing. If these requirements are not completed within this timeframe, the loan offer will be terminated, unless the applicant requests and the Agency approves an extension based on extenuating circumstances that the Agency was not aware of at the time the offer was made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Market survey.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the applicant must complete a separate market survey for each service area where the applicant proposes to provide service at the broadband lending speed. Each market survey must demonstrate the need for the service at the broadband lending speed, support the projected penetration rates and price points for the services to be offered, and support the feasibility analysis. The market survey must also address all other services that will be provided in connection with the broadband loan. Additional information on the requirements of the market survey can be found in the Application Guide.</P>
              <P>(b) The applicant is not required to complete a market survey for any service offering for which the applicant is projecting less than a 20 percent penetration rate in each service area by the end of the five-year forecast period. For example, if the applicant is projecting a penetration rate of 30 percent for data services and 15 percent for video services, a market survey must be completed for the data services. The proposed prices for those services with a projected penetration rate less than 20 percent must be affordable, as determined by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(c) For a market survey to be acceptable to the Agency, it must have been completed within six months of the application submission date. The Agency may reject any application in which the financial projections are not supported by the market survey. If the demographics of the proposed service area have significantly changed since the survey was completed, the Agency may require an updated market survey.</P>

Each analysis must identify all existing service providers and all resellers in each service area regardless of the provider's market share, for each type of service the applicant proposes to provide. This analysis must include each competitor's rate packages for all services offered, the area that is being covered, and to the extent possible, the quality of service being provided.</P>

              <P>(1) If the applicant is an existing company, it must provide complete copies of audited financial statements (opinion letter, balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in financial position, and notes to the financial statement) for the three fiscal years preceding the application submission. If audited statements are not available, the applicant must submit unaudited financial statements and tax returns for those fiscal years. Applications from start-up entities must, at a minimum, provide an opening balance sheet dated within 30 days of the final submission of all application material.</P>
              <P>(2) If the applicant is a subsidiary operation, it must also provide complete copies of audited financial statements for the parent operation for the fiscal year preceding the application submission. If audited statements are not available, unaudited financial statements and tax returns for the previous year must be submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) If the applicant relies on services provided by an affiliated operation, it must also provide complete copies of audited financial statements for any affiliate for the fiscal year preceding the application submission.

              <P>(b) Applicants must submit the following documents that demonstrate <PRTPAGE P="353"/>the proposed project's financial viability and ability to repay the requested loan.</P>
              <P>(1) Customer projections for the five-year forecast period that substantiate the projected revenues for each service that is to be provided. The projections must be provided on at least an annual basis and must be developed separately for each service area. These projections must be clearly supported by the information contained in the market survey, unless no market survey is required (see § 1738.209(b)).</P>
              <P>(2) Annual financial projections in the form of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements for the five-year forecast period. Prior to the submission of an application, an applicant may request that alternative information related to financial viability be considered when the applicant can for good cause demonstrate why a full five year forecast cannot be provided. If this request is approved by the Agency, then the applicant can submit the application using the alternative information that was approved.</P>
              <P>(i) These projections must use a system of accounts acceptable to the Agency and be supported by a detailed narrative that fully explains the methodology and assumptions used to develop the projections.</P>
              <P>(ii) The financial projections submitted by the applicant must demonstrate that their entire operation will be able to meet a minimum TIER requirement equal to 1.25 by the end of the five-year forecast period. Demonstrating that the operation can achieve a projected TIER of 1.25 does not ensure that the Agency will approve the loan.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the financial analysis suggests that the operation will not be able to achieve the required TIER ratio, the Agency will not approve the loan without additional capital, additional cash, additional security, and/or a change in the loan terms.</P>
              <P>(c) Based on the financial evaluation, the loan documents will specify TIER requirements that must be met throughout the amortization period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The provision of broadband service is vital to the economic development, education, health, and safety of rural Americans. The purpose of the Community Connect Grant Program is to provide financial assistance in the form of grants to eligible applicants that will provide, on a “community-oriented connectivity” basis, broadband service that fosters economic growth and delivers enhanced educational, health care, and public safety benefits. The Agency will give priority to rural areas that have the greatest need for broadband services, based on the criteria contained herein and in the RUS Community Connect Program application guide and/or the Community Connect Program website <PRTPAGE P="359"/>and in the funding opportunity announcement (FOA) posted on <E T="03">www.Grants.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Grant authority will be used for the deployment of service to all premises in eligible rural areas at the Broadband Grant Speed on a “community-oriented connectivity” basis. In addition to providing service to all premises the “community-oriented connectivity” concept will stimulate practical, everyday uses and applications of broadband by cultivating the deployment of new broadband services that improve economic development and provide enhanced educational and health care opportunities in rural areas. Such an approach will also give rural communities the opportunity to benefit from the advanced technologies that are necessary to achieve these goals.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1740.8</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Scoring criteria for the grant competition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After an application is found to be eligible, it will be scored in three categories: the rurality of the applicant's core coverage area, the average National School Lunch Program eligibility ratio in the applicant's core coverage area, and the critical need for the project.</P>

              <P>(b)(1)(i) Scoring in this program is based on a simplified representation of the project's digital coverage area. To find a transmitter's simplified coverage area, go to the FCC TV Query Web site () and access the station Service Contour Map. This map shows coverage at the appropriate field strength in dBμ The core coverage area is the set of counties that are either entirely within the appropriate coverage contour, or are at least seventy-five percent (75%) within the contour. For contours where counties are very large with respect to coverage, as might be the case for some western states and for most translators, there may be only <PRTPAGE P="368"/>one county within the coverage contour. In such cases, this county is the station's core coverage area. Every transmitter and translator must have a core coverage area consisting of one or more counties.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of translators, where a coverage contour area does not exist, the applicant shall define a coverage contour area and explain how coverage was estimated. This estimated coverage contour area is subject to acceptance by RUS.</P>
              <P>(2) When an application covers more than one transmitter or translator, the core coverage area of the application is the sum of the core coverage areas of all transmitters and translators included in the application.</P>
              <P>(c) Rurality is a measure of the degree to which a project benefits rural areas. Up to fifty (50) points are available in this category. Urban areas bisected by the computed contour line are disregarded, since they represent fringe viewers. The Rurality score is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The rural population of a core coverage area must be calculated. The rural population of a county is calculated by subtracting the county's urban population(s) from the total county population. If the core coverage area consists of multiple counties, the rural population is the sum of all included counties' rural populations.</P>

              <P>(2) The Rurality score is computed by multiplying the rural population for the core coverage area by one hundred (100), and subtracting fifty (50) from it. If this calculation results in a negative number, the Rurality score is zero. The formula is:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">100 × [(total population − urban population)/total population] − 50</FP>
              
              <P>(3) If an applicant has no urban communities within the core coverage area, the computation would deliver a score of 50.</P>
              <P>(d) Economic Need will be measured by the ability of the public in an area to support Public Television financially. Up to 25 points are available in this category.</P>

              <P>(1) The score for Economic Need is computed from the average of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) eligibility percentages for all school districts within the core coverage area. NSLP eligibility percentage information may be obtained from the state or local agency that administers the program, and the application must include a certification from this organization that the percentages provided are correct. Please note that the score for Economic Need is computed from the eligibility percentage, not the participation percentage. The score is computed by multiplying the average eligibility percentage by 100 (to convert percentage to a whole number), subtracting 25, dividing the quotient by two, and limiting the result to 25 points. A negative result yields a score of zero.
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">[(average NSLP eligibility percentage × 100) − 25] ÷ 2, not to exceed 25 points</FP>
              
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) Critical Need will be measured by the urgency and importance of the project to the rural community the applicant serves. Up to 25 points are available in this category. Critical Need evaluates factors not captured in the Rurality and Economic Need scoring categories, such as:</P>
              <P>(1) Geographic or coverage characteristics of the public television station's digital television coverage area that make the digital transition unusually expensive;</P>
              <P>(2) A severe lack of specialized human resources (such as teachers) for which digital educational television will compensate;</P>
              <P>(3) Geographic isolation of communities which will be overcome with public television station services;</P>
              <P>(4) Non-traditional community needs (such as adult vocational retraining) that may be met only with digital public television station broadcast capabilities;</P>
              <P>(5) Historical events that have placed the public television station in severe financial stress; and</P>
              <P>(6) The degree to which the project purposes will specifically benefit the rural public.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Recent changes in the telecommunications industry, including deregulation and technological developments, have caused Rural Utilities Service (RUS) borrowers and other organizations providing telecommunications services to consider undertaking projects that provide new telecommunications services and other telecommunications services not ordinarily financed by RUS. Although some of these services may not be eligible for financing under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act), these services may nevertheless advance RE Act objectives where the borrower obtains financing from private lenders. The borrower's financial strength and the assurance of repayment of outstanding Government debt may be improved as a result of providing such telecommunications services.</P>
              <P>(b) To facilitate the financing of new services and other services not ordinarily financed by RUS, RUS is willing to consider accommodating the Government's lien on telecommunications borrowers' systems or accommodating or subordinating the Government's lien on after-acquired property of telecommunications borrowers. To expedite this process, requests for lien accommodations meeting the requirements of § 1744.30 will receive automatic approval from RUS.</P>
              <P>(c) This subpart establishes RUS policy with respect to all requests for lien accommodations and subordinations for loans from private lenders. For borrowers that do not qualify for automatic lien accommodations in accordance with § 1744.30, RUS will consider lien accommodations for RE Act purposes under § 1744.40 and non-Act purposes under § 1744.50.</P>

The private lender is responsible for ensuring that the supplemental mortgage is a valid and binding instrument enforceable in accordance with its terms, and recorded and filed in accordance with applicable law. If the private lender determines that additional documents are required or that RUS must take additional actions to secure the notes under the mortgage, the private lender shall follow the procedures set forth in § 1744.40 or § 1744.50, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Refinancing and refunding.</E> The Administrator will automatically approve a borrower's execution of private lender notes and the securing of such notes on a pari passu or pro-rata basis with all other notes secured under the Government mortgage, when such private lender notes are issued for the purpose of refinancing or refunding any notes secured under the Government mortgage, provided that all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) No default has occurred and is continuing under the Government mortgage;</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower has delivered to the Administrator, at least 10 business days before the private lender notes are to be executed, a certification and agreement executed by the President of the borrower's Board of Directors, such certification and agreement to be substantially in the form set forth in Appendix A of this subpart, providing that:</P>
              <P>(i) No default has occurred and is continuing under the Government mortgage;</P>

              <P>(iii) The weighted-average life of the private loan evidenced by the private lender notes will not exceed the weighted-average remaining life of the notes being refinanced or refunded;</P>
              <P>(iv) The private lender notes will provide for substantially level debt service or level principal amortization over a period not less than the original remaining years to maturity;</P>
              <P>(v) Except as provided in the Government mortgage, the borrower has not agreed to any restrictions or limitations on future loans from RUS; and</P>
              <P>(vi) If the private lender determines that a supplemental mortgage is necessary, the borrower will comply with those procedures contained in paragraph (h) of this section for the preparation, execution, and delivery of a supplemental mortgage and take such additional action as may be required to secure the notes under the Government mortgage.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Financing assets to be owned directly by a borrower.</E> The Administrator will automatically approve a borrower's execution of private lender notes and the securing of such notes on a pari passu or pro-rata basis with all other notes secured under the Government mortgage, when such private lender notes are issued for the purpose of financing the purchase or construction of plant and material and supplies to provide telecommunication services and when such assets are to be owned and the telecommunications services are to be offered by the borrower, provided that all of the following conditions are met:</P>

              <P>(3) The government is not responsible for ensuring that the supplemental mortgage has been executed by all parties and is a valid and binding instrument enforceable in accordance with its terms, and recorded and filed in accordance with applicable law. If the private lender determines that additional security instruments or other documents are required or that RUS must take additional actions to secure the private lender notes under the mortgage, the private lender shall follow the procedures established in §§ 1744.40 or 1744.50, as appropriate. Except for the actions of the government expressly established in § 1744.40, the government undertakes no obligation to effectuate an automatic lien accommodation. When processing of the supplemental mortgage has been completed to the satisfaction of the private lender, the borrower shall provide RUS with the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A fully executed counterpart of the supplemental mortgage, including all signatures, seals, and acknowledgements; and</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Other approvals.</E> (1) The borrower is responsible for meeting all requirements necessary to issue private lender notes and to accommodate the lien of the Government mortgage to secure the private lender notes including, but not limited to, those of the private lender, of any other mortgagees secured under the existing RUS mortgage, and of any governmental entities with jurisdiction over the issuance of notes or the execution and delivery of the supplemental mortgage.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent that the borrower's existing mortgage requires RUS approval before the borrower can make an investment in an affiliated company, approval is hereby given for all investments made in affiliated companies with the proceeds of private lender notes qualifying for an automatic lien accommodation under paragraph (e) of this section. Any reference to an approval by RUS under the mortgage shall apply only to the rights of RUS and not to any other party.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The telephone loan budget.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When the loan is made, RUS provides the borrower a Telephone Loan Budget, RUS Form 493. This budget divides the loan into budget accounts such as “Engineering.” When a contract or other document is approved by RUS, funds are encumbered from the appropriate budget account. See 7 CFR part 1753.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Budget adjustment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If more funds are required than are available in a budget account, the borrower may request RUS's approval of a budget adjustment to use funds from another account. The request shall include an explanation of the change, the budget account to be used, and a description of how the adjustment will affect loan purposes. RUS will not approve a budget adjustment that affects other loan purposes unless the borrower satisfies RUS that the additional funds are available from another source, requests a deficiency loan, or scales back the project.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS may make a budget adjustment without a formal request by the borrower when a budget account is insufficient to encumber funds for a contract that otherwise would be approved by RUS. See 7 CFR part 1753.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The construction fund.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The construction fund is used by the borrower primarily to hold advances until disbursed.</P>
              <P>(b) All advances shall be deposited in the construction fund.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS may require that other funds be deposited in the construction fund. These may include equity or general fund contributions to construction, service termination payments, proceeds from the sale of property, amounts recovered from insurance for losses during the construction period, and interest received on loan funds in savings or interest bearing checking accounts, and similar receipts. Deposit slips for any deposit to the construction fund shall show the source and amount of funds deposited and be executed by an authorized representative of the bank.</P>
              <P>(d) Funds shall be disbursed only up to the amount approved for advance on the FRS as described in § 1744.66. No funds may be withdrawn from the fund except for loan purposes approved by RUS.</P>
              <P>(e) The disbursement of nonloan funds requires the same RUS approvals as loan funds.</P>

              <P>(f) Disbursements must be evidenced by canceled checks. The invoices and supporting documentation needed for construction contracts are specified in the contracts and in 7 CFR part 1753. Disbursements to reimburse the borrower's general funds shall be documented by a reimbursement schedule, <E T="03">to be retained in the borrower's files,</E> that lists the construction fund check number, date, and an explanation of amounts reimbursed by budget account.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The financial requirement statement (FRS).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To request advances, the borrower must submit to RUS an FRS, a description of the advances desired, and other information related to the transactions when required by RUS.</P>
              <P>(b) The FRS is used by RUS and the borrower to record and control transactions in the construction fund. Approved contracts and other items are shown on the FRS under “Approved Purposes.” Except as noted below, the amount approved for advance is 100 percent of the amount encumbered for that item. Funds are approved for advance as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Construction</E>—(i) <E T="03">Construction contracts and force account proposals.</E> Ninety percent of the encumbered amount (95 percent for outside plant), with the final 10 percent (5 percent) approved when RUS approves the closeout documents. When a contract contains supplement “A” (See 7 CFR part 1753), 90 percent (95 percent) of the contract is approved less materials supplied by the borrower. For the Supplement “A” materials, which are a separate entry on the FRS, 100 percent of the material cost is approved.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Work orders.</E> The portion of the work order summary (See 7 CFR part 1753) determined by RUS to be for approved loan purposes.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Work order fund.</E> Based on a borrower's request as described in 7 CFR part 1753.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Real estate.</E> Upon request by the borrower after submission of evidence of a valid title.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Right of way procurement.</E> Based on the borrower's itemized costs.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Joint use charges.</E> Based on copies of invoices from the other utility.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Engineering</E>—(i) <E T="03">Preloan engineering.</E> Based on a final itemized invoice from the engineer.<PRTPAGE P="390"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Postloan engineering contracts.</E> The amount shown on the engineering estimate, RUS Form 506, less the amount estimated for construction contract closeouts. The balance is approved when the engineering contract is closed.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Force account engineering.</E> Ninety percent of the total amount of the RUS approved force account engineering proposal. The balance is approved when the force account engineering proposal is closed.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Office equipment, vehicles and work equipment.</E> Based on copies of invoices for the equipment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">General</E>—(i) <E T="03">Organization and loan expenditures.</E> Based on an itemized list of requirements prepared by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Construction overhead.</E> Based on an itemized list of expenditures. If funds are required for employee salaries, the itemization shall include the employee's position, the period covered, total compensation for the period, and the portion of compensation attributable to the itemized construction.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Legal fees.</E> Based on itemized invoices from the attorney.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Bank stock.</E> Based on the requirements for purchase of class B Rural Telephone Bank stock established in the loan. Funds for class B stock will be advanced in an amount equal to 5 percent of the amount, exclusive of the amount for class B stock, of each loan advance, at the time of such advance.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Operating expenses</E>—(i) <E T="03">Working capital—new system.</E> Based on the borrower's itemized estimate.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Current operating deficiencies.</E> Based on a current and projected balance sheet submitted by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Debt retirement and refinancing.</E> Upon release of the loan, based on the amount in the approved budget.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Acquisitions.</E> Based on final itemized costs, but cannot exceed the amount in the approved loan budget.</P>
              <P>(c) Funds other than loan funds deposited in the construction fund, which shall include proceeds from the sale of property on which RUS has a lien, (lines 10 and 11 on the FRS) are reported as a credit under total disbursements. Disbursements of these funds are subject to the same RUS approvals as loan funds.</P>
              <P>(d) The borrower shall request advances as needed to meet its obligations promptly. Generally, RUS does not approve an advance requested more than 60 days before the obligation is payable.</P>
              <P>(e) Funds should be disbursed for the item for which they were advanced. If the borrower needs to pay an invoice for which funds have not been advanced, and disbursement of advanced funds for another item has been delayed, the latter funds may be disbursed to pay the invoice up to the amount approved for advance for that item on the FRS. The borrower shall make erasable entries on the next FRS showing the changes under “Total Advances to Date” and shall explain the changes in writing before RUS will process the next FRS.</P>
              <P>(f) Advances will be rounded down to the nearest thousands of dollars except for final amounts.</P>
              <P>(g) The certification on each of the three copies of the FRS sent to RUS shall be signed by a corporate officer of manager authorized by resolution of the board of directors to sign such statements. At the time of such authorization a certified copy of the resolution and one copy of RUS Form 675, Certificate of Authority, shall be submitted to RUS.</P>
              <P>(h) The documentation required for the FRS transactions are the deposit slips, the canceled construction fund checks and the supporting invoices or reimbursement schedules. These shall be kept in the borrower's files for periodic audits by RUS.</P>

              <P>(a) RUS telephone borrowers are encouraged to utilize their own funds to participate in the economic development of rural areas, provided that such activity does not impair a borrower's ability to provide modern telecommunications services at reasonable rates or to repay its indebtedness to RUS and other lenders.

              <P>(a) Each borrower is authorized to make investments other than qualified investments only in accordance with the provisions of the borrower's mortgage with RUS.

              <P>(b) RUS will consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests for approval of rural development investments not constituting qualified investments. RUS may condition such approval, if granted, on such requirements and restrictions as RUS may determine to be in the best interests of the Government, including, without limitation, the borrower's agreement to limit dividends or distributions of capital by an amount specified by RUS. Requests for such approvals must be submitted in writing to the relevant RUS regional office and shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of the rural development project and the type of investment to be made, such as a loan, guarantee, stock purchase or equity investment;</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is the policy of RUS that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's telecommunications network.</P>
              <P>(b) A proposed Modernization Plan must be submitted to RUS for approval. RUS will approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart. Once obtained, RUS's approval of a Modernization Plan cannot be rescinded.</P>
              <P>(c) The Modernization Plan shall not interfere with RUS's authority to issue such other telecommunications standards, specifications, requirements, and procurement rules as may be promulgated from time to time by RUS including, without limitation, those set forth in 7 CFR part 1755.</P>
              <P>(d) The Modernization Plan must, at a minimum, apply to RUS Borrowers' wireline service areas. If a Modernization Plan is developed by the PUC, RUS encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all providers of telecommunications services in the State. A PUC's decision not to include non-RUS Borrowers will not prejudice RUS approval of that PUC's Modernization Plan. The PUC may also, at its option, extend coverage of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all providers of telecommunications services in the State. In addition, while the requirements and goals contained in § 1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in the State as it deems appropriate. Borrower-developed Modernization Plans apply only to Borrowers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Modernization Plan Developer; eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each PUC is eligible until February 13, 1996 to develop a proposed Modernization Plan and deliver it to RUS. RUS will review and consider for approval all PUC-developed Modernization Plans received by RUS within this one year period. The review and approval, if any, may occur after the one year period ends even though the PUC is no longer eligible to submit a proposed Modernization Plan.</P>
              <P>(b) The PUC must notify all Telecommunications Providers in the State and other interested parties of its intent to develop a proposed Modernization Plan. The PUC is encouraged to consider all Telecommunications Providers' and interested parties' views and incorporate these views into the Modernization Plan. In the event that the PUC does not intend to develop a proposed Modernization Plan, RUS requests that the PUC inform RUS of this decision as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If the PUC is no longer eligible to develop a Modernization Plan or has informed RUS that it will not develop a Modernization Plan, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a majority of the Borrowers within the State may develop the Modernization Plan. If a majority of Borrowers develops the Modernization Plan, the following apply:</P>
              <P>(i) All Borrowers shall be given reasonable notice of and shall be encouraged to attend and contribute to all meetings and other proceedings relating to the development of the Modernization Plan; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Borrowers developing a Modernization Plan are encouraged to solicit the views of other providers of telecommunications services and interested parties in the State.</P>
              <P>(2) There is no time limit placed on Borrowers to develop a Modernization Plan. Borrowers should be aware that certain types of loans may be restricted until a Modernization Plan is approved. See § 1751.103.</P>

              <P>(a) For information about loan eligibility requirements in relation to the Modernization Plan, see 7 CFR part <PRTPAGE P="399"/>1735. In particular, beginning February 13, 1996, RUS will make RUS hardship loans, RUS cost-of-money loans, and RTB loans for facilities and other RE Act purposes in a State only if:</P>
              <P>(1) The State has an RUS approved Modernization Plan; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Borrower to whom the loan is to be made is participating in the Modernization Plan for the State. A Borrower is considered to be participating if, in RUS's opinion, the purposes of the loan requested by the Borrower are consistent with the Borrower achieving the requirements stated in the Modernization Plan within the timeframe stated in the Modernization Plan unless RUS has determined that achieving the requirements is not technically or economically feasible.</P>
              <P>(b) With regard to the three types of loans discussed in paragraph (a), only loans approved after the date the State has an RUS approved Modernization Plan are subject to complying with the Modernization Plan.</P>
              <P>(c) For loans subject to complying with the Modernization Plan, advances will not be made if, in RUS's opinion, the advances are not consistent with achieving the requirements of the Modernization Plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Obtaining RUS approval of a proposed Modernization Plan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To obtain RUS approval of a proposed Modernization Plan, the Plan Developer must submit the following to RUS:</P>
              <P>(1) A certified copy of the statute or PUC order, if the PUC is the Plan Developer, or a written request for RUS approval of the proposed Modernization Plan signed by an authorized representative of the Plan Developer, if a majority of Borrowers is the Plan Developer; and</P>
              <P>(2) Three copies of the proposed Modernization Plan.</P>
              <P>(b) Generally, RUS will review the proposed Modernization Plan within (30) days and either:</P>
              <P>(1) Approve the Modernization Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart in which case RUS will return a copy of the Modernization Plan with notice of approval to the Plan Developer; or</P>
              <P>(2) Not approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it does not conform to the provisions of this subpart. In this event, RUS will return the proposed Modernization Plan to the Plan Developer with specific written comments and suggestions for modifying the proposed Modernization Plan so that it will conform to the provisions of this subpart. If the Plan Developer remains eligible, RUS will invite the Plan Developer to submit a modified proposed Modernization Plan for RUS consideration. This process can continue until the Plan Developer gains approval of a proposed Modernization Plan unless the Plan Developer is a PUC whose eligibility has expired. If a PUC's eligibility has expired, RUS will return the proposed Modernization Plan unapproved. Because RUS does not have authority to extend the term of a PUC's eligibility, RUS recommends that the PUC submit a proposed Modernization Plan at least 90 days in advance of February 13, 1996 to allow time for this process.</P>

              <P>(b) The Plan Developer of the Modernization Plan may amend the Modernization Plan if RUS finds the proposed changes continue to conform to the provisions of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(c) The procedure for requesting approval of an amended Modernization Plan is identical to the procedure for a proposed Modernization Plan except that there are no time limits on the eligibility of the Plan Developer.<PRTPAGE P="400"/>

              <P>(e) RUS may from time to time revise these regulations to incorporate newer technological and economic standards that RUS believes represent more desirable goals for the future course of telecommunications services. Such revisions will be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. These revisions shall not invalidate Modernization Plans approved by RUS but shall be used by RUS to determine whether to approve amendments to Modernization Plans presented for RUS approval after March 15, 1995.</P>

              <P>(d) Within the scope of § 1751.101(d), if the Plan Developer is the PUC, the Modernization Plan shall name the Telecommunications Providers in the State, in addition to Borrowers, that are covered by the Modernization Plan.</P>
              <P>(e) The Modernization Plan must require that the design of the network provided by Telecommunications Providers allow for the expeditious deployment and integration of such emerging technologies as may from time to time become commercially feasible.</P>

              <P>(f) The Modernization Plan must provide guidelines to Telecommunications Providers for the development of affordable tariffs for medical links and distance learning services.<PRTPAGE P="401"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) With regard to the uniform deployment requirement of the law restated in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if services cannot be deployed at the same time, only the minimum feasible interval of time shall separate availability of the services in rural and nonrural areas.</P>
              <P>(h) The Modernization Plan must make provision for reliable powering of ordinary voice telephone service operating over those portions of the telecommunications network which are not network powered. In the event of electric utility power outages, an alternative source of power must be available to ensure reliable voice service.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Short-term requirements.</E> (1) The “short-term requirements start date” is the date one year after the date RUS approves the Modernization Plan for the State.</P>
              <P>(2) All New Facilities providing Wireline Service after the short-term requirements start date, even if the construction began before such date, shall be constructed so that:</P>
              <P>(i) Every subscriber can be provided 1-party service.</P>
              <P>(ii) The New Facilities are suitable, as built or with additional equipment, to provide transmission and reception of data at a rate no lower than 1 Mb/sec.</P>
              <P>(3) All switching equipment installed by a Telecommunications Provider after the short-term requirements start date shall be capable of:</P>
              <P>(i) Providing custom calling features. At a minimum, custom calling features must include call waiting, call forwarding, abbreviated dialing, and three-way calling; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Providing E911 service for areas served by the Telecommunication Provider when requested by the government responsible for this service.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Medium-term requirements.</E> (1) The “medium-term requirements start date” is the date six years after the date RUS approves the Modernization Plan for the State, or such earlier date as the Modernization Plan shall provide.</P>
              <P>(2) All New Facilities providing Wireline Service after the medium-term requirements start date, even if the construction began before such date, shall be capable, as built or with additional equipment, of transmitting video to a subscriber. The video must be capable of depicting a reasonable representation of motion. The frame rate, resolution, and other measures of audio and video quality shall be determined by the Plan Developer.</P>
              <P>(3) No later than the medium-term requirements start date, all switching equipment of Telecommunications Providers covered by the Modernization Plan must be capable of providing E911 service when requested by the government responsible for this service.</P>
              <P>(4) No later than five years after the medium-term requirements start date, one-party service must be provided upon demand to any subscriber of a Telecommunications Provider covered by the Modernization Plan.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Long-term goals.</E> RUS suggests, but does not require, that the provisions of each Modernization Plan be consistent with the accomplishment of the following:</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1753.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The standard RUS Telecommunications Loan Documents contain provisions regarding procurement of materials and equipment and construction of telecommunications facilities by telecommunications borrowers. This part implements certain of the provisions by setting forth requirements and procedures. Borrowers shall follow these requirements and procedures whenever using loan funds to purchase materials and equipment or perform construction, unless they have received the Administrator's written approval to do otherwise.</P>
              <P>(b) The typical procedure followed in constructing a project financed by an RUS loan begins with the prospective borrower obtaining the necessary preloan engineering and developing a complete loan application, including an LD (See 7 CFR part 1737). If a loan is approved and all prerequisites to advance of funds are satisfied, the borrower may proceed with the purchase and installation of materials and equipment and the construction of telephone facilities pursuant to this part 1753. Subpart A describes</P>
              <P>(1) RUS's general requirements with respect to steps to be taken after the loan is approved and before construction begins (See § 1753.3),</P>
              <P>(2) RUS requirements with respect to methods of construction (See §§ 1753.5 and 1753.6),</P>

              <P>(3) RUS requirements regarding sealed competitive bidding and negotiated bidding of construction contracts (See §§ 1753.6 and 1753.9),<PRTPAGE P="403"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) RUS standards for materials, equipment, and construction financed with loan funds (See § 1753.7), and</P>
              <P>(5) RUS requirements for subcontracts and contract amendments covering construction financed with loan funds (See §§ 1753.10 and 1753.12).</P>
              <P>(c) Each borrower is responsible for the construction of its facilities and for the procurement of materials and equipment that are best suited to its needs.</P>
              <P>(d) If contracts, P&amp;S, or other methods of procurement are subject to RUS approval pursuant to the provisions of the loan contract, as implemented by this part, RUS will review the documents or proposals submitted and notify the borrower in writing of approval or disapproval. RUS may withhold approval if, in RUS's judgment:</P>
              <P>(1) The P&amp;S or contract will not accomplish loan purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) Provisions of the P&amp;S or contract will add unnecessary expense to the project.</P>
              <P>(3) The proposal, method of procurement, or P&amp;S do not conform to RUS engineering criteria or construction standards, or if they present unacceptable loan security risks to RUS.</P>
              <P>(4) The P&amp;S or contract have been modified.</P>
              <P>(e) The requirements and procedures covering procurement of architectural and engineering services are described in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) Single copies of RUS forms cited in this part are available from Administrative Services Division, Rural Utilities Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1500. These RUS forms may be reproduced.</P>

              <P>(11) <E T="03">Award of contract.</E> (i) The borrower shall obtain from the engineer the determination of the lowest responsive bid, a tabulation of all bids and the engineer's recommendation for award of the contract. Contract award is subject to RUS approval if either the cost of the project is over $500,000 or the contract is with an organization affiliated with the borrower. Contract award of all other projects is not subject to RUS approval.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an award is made, the borrower shall award the contract to the lowest responsive bidder. The borrower may award the contract immediately upon determination of the lowest responsive bidder if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The project is included in an approved loan and adequate funds were budgeted in the loan and are available.</P>
              <P>(B) All applicable RUS procedures were followed, including those in the Notice and Instructions to Bid in the standard forms of contract.</P>
              <P>(iii) If RUS approval of the award of contract is required under this paragraph (a)(11), the borrower shall send to RUS for consideration of approval of the award:</P>
              <P>(A) Two copies of the low bid.</P>
              <P>(B) The engineer's recommendation and the tabulation of all bids.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The standard RUS loan documents contain provisions regarding engineering and architectural services performed by or for RUS telecommunications borrowers. This part implements certain of the provisions by setting forth the requirements and procedures to be followed by borrowers in selecting architects and engineers and obtaining architectural and engineering services by contract or by force account.</P>
              <P>(2) Borrowers shall obtain architectural and engineering services only from persons or firms which are not affiliated with, and have not represented, a contractor, vendor or manufacturer who may provide labor, materials, or equipment to the borrower under any current loan.</P>
              <P>(3) Preloan architectural and engineering services may be provided by qualified personnel on the borrower's staff or by consultants. Neither the selection of a preloan architect or engineer by a borrower, nor the contractual arrangements with them, requires RUS approval.</P>
              <P>(4) Postloan architectural and engineering services shall be obtained by borrowers from registered architects and engineers licensed in the State in which the facilities will be located, except where RUS has approved the borrower to provide these services by the force account method. When the extent of the proposed major or minor construction is such that the postloan engineering involved is within the capabilities of employees on the borrower's staff, the borrower may request RUS approval to provide such services. This method of providing engineering services is referred to as force account engineering. Refer to § 1753.17(c).</P>
              <P>(5)(i) For major construction, services provided by architects and engineers not on the borrower's staff must be provided under Form 220, Architectural Service Contract, or Form 217, Postloan Engineering Service Contract—Telecommunications. These contracts require RUS approval.</P>
              <P>(ii) For minor construction, borrowers may use the contracts in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section for postloan architectural or engineering services or any other form of contract, such as Form 245, Engineering Service Contract, Special Services—Telephone. RUS approval of contracts for postloan architectural or engineering services associated with minor construction, except for buildings covered in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, is not required.</P>
              <P>(6) For buildings to be constructed with RUS funds, postloan architectural or engineering services shall be obtained if (1) the construction cost exceeds $50,000 (prefab buildings using manufacturer's specifications approved by RUS are exempt from this requirement) or (2) soil or seismic conditions require special design considerations.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of this subpart B:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Contract</E>—The services contract between the borrower and its architect or engineer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Force Account Engineering</E>—Any preloan or postloan engineering services performed by the borrower's staff.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Postloan engineering services</E>—The design, procurement, and inspection of construction to accomplish the objectives of a loan as stated in a LD approved by RUS.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Preloan engineering services</E>—The planning and design work performed in preparing a LD. This consists of helping the borrower determine the objectives for a loan, including consideration of RUS's requirements relating to the modernization plan, selecting the most effective and efficient methods of meeting loan objectives, and preparing the LD which describes the objectives and presents the method selected to meet them.</P>

              <P>(e) The borrower shall take sealed competitive bids for all central office equipment to be purchased under RUS Contract Form 395 using the procedure set forth in Sec. 1753.38(a), unless RUS approval to negotiate is obtained.</P>
              <P>(f) The borrower may request permission to negotiate with a single supplier for additional central offices to standardize equipment on a system basis. RUS approval to negotiate must be obtained before release of the plans and specifications to the supplier. Except for remote switching terminals associated with an existing central office, RUS will not approve negotiation with a non-domestic manufacturer for the purpose of standardization because such a purchase does not meet the RE Act “Buy American” provisions.</P>
              <P>(g) Materials and equipment must meet the standards and general specifications approved by RUS.</P>
              <P>(h) Only new equipment shall be purchased unless otherwise approved by RUS.</P>
              <P>(i) All purchases of materials and equipment are subject to the “Buy American” requirements.</P>
              <P>(j) If the sealed competitive bid procedure is followed, negotiation after bid opening will not be permitted.</P>

The procedure is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Solicitation of bids.</E> (i) After RUS approval of the specifications and equipment requirements (required only for projects expected to exceed $500,000 or 25% of the loan, whichever is less), the borrower shall send “Notice and Instructions to Bidders” to suppliers with central office equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) The “Notice” must set forth the method of evaluating bids and must require the submission of equipment lists and traffic calculations with the bids.</P>
              <P>(iii) Equipment Contract, RUS Contract Form 395 (RUS Contract Form 395) shall be used, except that the “Notice” shall state that prior to the bid opening a technical session will be conducted with each supplier to resolve any questions related to the technical proposal submitted by the supplier. The suppliers' technical proposals should be requested for presentation 30 days in advance of the bid opening to enable sufficient time to make the technical evaluation.</P>
              <P>(iv) The borrower shall solicit bids as set forth in § 1753.8(a)(2). The “Notice” shall be sent to at least three prospective bidders. A copy of the “Notice” and a list of such bidders shall be sent to RUS.</P>
              <P>(v) At the request of an invited supplier, the borrower shall provide two copies of the P&amp;S.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Technical Sessions.</E> (i) The borrower shall schedule individual technical sessions by the suppliers, notify each supplier of its scheduled date and time, notify the GFR of all scheduled dates and times, and request the following be available at the technical session:</P>
              <P>(A) Lists of equipment, material and software.</P>
              <P>(B) Proposed floor plan.</P>
              <P>(C) Power and heat dissipation calculations.</P>

              <P>(E) Protection and grounding requirements.</P>
              <P>(F) Description of how office administration, maintenance and traffic collection are handled with step-by-step examples and printouts.</P>
              <P>(G) Explanation of processor and/or memory expansion required to meet ultimate size. This shall include discussions of software, processor memory, and hardware additions needed for line additions and the introduction of various future services; the relative costs of installing the necessary hardware and software initially as compared with the anticipated cost if installed at the time when the future services are to be offered.</P>
              <P>(H) Description of how special equipment such as loop tests, volunteer fire alarm circuit, line load control, etc., will function.</P>
              <P>(I) Description of method for translating initial office administration information into machine language, and proposal as to whether it will be done by the borrower or by the supplier.</P>
              <P>(J) Some types of equipment contain software. RUS Contract Form 395 indicates whether the equipment contains software and whether the software contract stipulations are applicable.</P>
              <P>(K) Any other items pertinent to the technical proposal, such as information regarding changes that have been made in hardware and software of the equipment that is of like manufacture to that presently in operation in the borrower's system. This shall include requirements for additional spare parts or training which have developed as a result of significant change in system device technology.</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower shall review in detail all exceptions to the P&amp;S. No exceptions will be accepted unless all bidders are notified, in writing, of the change in the specifications and permitted to incorporate the change in their proposal.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the technical proposal is not responsive, the borrower shall notify the supplier, in writing, that its proposal will not be given further consideration and why.</P>
              <P>(iv) Changes in the P&amp;S resulting from the technical sessions shall be subject to RUS's review and approval.</P>

              <P>(v) After evaluation of the technical proposals and RUS approval of the changes to P&amp;S (required only for projects that are expected to exceed $500,000 or 25% of the loan, whichever is less), sealed bids shall be solicited from only those bidders whose technical proposals meet P&amp;S requirements. When fewer than three bidders are adjudged <PRTPAGE P="419"/>qualified by the borrower to bid, RUS approval must be obtained to proceed. Generally, RUS will grant such approval only if the borrower can demonstrate to the satisfaction of RUS that a good faith effort was made to obtain at least three competitive bids. This would be demonstrated if all suppliers currently listed in I.P. 300-4 were invited to submit technical proposals.</P>
              <P>(vi) The borrower shall invite the GFR to attend the technical sessions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Bidding and award of contract.</E> (i) All bids must be completed, dated, and signed prior to submission.</P>
              <P>(ii) The bid opening and award of contract shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 1753.8(a).</P>
              <P>(iii) The spare parts bid shall always be priced separately and added to the base bid when determining the low bidder.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Single source negotiated procurement.</E> If RUS has approved the borrower's request to procure central office equipment through single source negotiation in accordance with requirements contained in § 1753.36(f), the borrower shall proceed in accordance with this subsection.</P>

              <P>(a) This subpart implements and explains the provisions of the loan documents setting forth the requirements and procedures to be followed by borrowers when outside plant major construction by contract is financed by loan funds. Terms used in this subpart are defined in § 1753.2 and RUS Contract Form 515.</P>
              <P>(b) The contract method for major construction is described in § 1753.5(b).</P>
              <P>(c) The two contract forms which may be used for major outside plant construction are Form 515 and Form 773. Limitations on the applicability of these forms shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Form 515 shall be used for major outside plant construction projects which will be competitively bid. The contract contains plans and specifications and has no dollar limitation. See §§ 1753.47, 1753.48 and 1753.49.</P>
              <P>(2) Contract Form 515, which is for $250,000 or less, may, at the borrower's option, be negotiated. See § 1753.48(b).</P>
              <P>(3) RUS Form 773 may be used for minor outside plant projects which are not competitively bid because they cannot be designed and staked at the time of contract execution. Projects of this nature include routine line extensions and placement of subscriber drops. See subpart I of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purchasing special equipment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Equipment purchases are categorized as initial equipment purchase, equipment additions to existing systems and new system additions.</P>
              <P>(i) An initial equipment purchase is a first time purchase by a borrower of a complete system of special equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Equipment additions to existing systems are additions of components to complete operating systems to increase system capacity that require components made by the manufacturer of the existing system.</P>
              <P>(iii) New system additions are purchases of complete systems of special equipment when the purpose can be accomplished either with equipment of the same type and manufacture as other complete operating systems in the borrower's system, or with complete systems of special equipment from other manufacturers.</P>
              <P>(iv) Where equipment is obtained under a Equipment Contract, RUS Contract Form 395 (RUS Contract Form 395) without installation, the borrower shall require the supplier to provide a detailed proposed bonding and grounding plan and detailed installation information. The installation information is to enable acceptance testing by the borrower upon completion of the installation.</P>

              <P>(2) For initial equipment purchases that qualify as major construction, the borrower shall obtain proposals from at <PRTPAGE P="429"/>least three suppliers of equipment of different manufacturers.</P>
              <P>(3) For equipment additions to increase the capacity of existing systems, the borrower may negotiate for equipment of a specific type and manufacture. RUS approval to negotiate in this instance is not required if these additions were specifically described in the LD approved by RUS</P>
              <P>(4) For new system additions, the borrower may request RUS approval to negotiate for additional equipment for the purpose of standardization on a system basis, provided RUS approved the procurement method used for the initial equipment purchase. RUS approval to negotiate must be obtained before release of the P&amp;S to the seller.</P>
              <P>(5) RUS will not approve negotiation with a seller of non-domestic equipment for the purpose of standardization, because such a purchase does not meet the “Buy American” provision.</P>
              <P>(6) RUS recommends, but does not require, that borrowers include installation by the seller for initial installations of special equipment that qualify as major construction.</P>
              <P>(7) Special equipment may be installed by the borrower if it has qualified personnel and test equipment available to install the equipment and make the required acceptance tests, and written approval is given by RUS.</P>
              <P>(8) Installations, whether by the borrower or the seller, must meet the installation requirements of RUS Contract Form 395specifications. A copy of the acceptance tests results must be attached to the closeout documents or work order summary.</P>
              <P>(9) The specifications for the various applications of equipment is prepared by the RUS borrower's engineer and based on generally accepted engineering considerations and practices found in the Telecommunications Industry.</P>
              <P>(10) The borrower must obtain authorization from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to construct and operate radio transmitting equipment. Evidence of FCC authorization is required for RUS contract approval. Where required, the borrower must obtain approval of state regulatory bodies regarding tariffs and related matters.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procurement procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The following are the procurement procedure steps required for the purchase of special equipment by borrowers.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Initial equipment purchase.</E> (i) The borrower prepares P&amp;S and, for projects estimated to exceed $500,000 or 25% of the loan, whichever is less, sends two copies to GFR for approval.</P>
              <P>(ii) For projects estimated to exceed $500,000 or 25% of the loan, whichever is less, RUS will either approve P&amp;S in writing or notify the borrower of the reasons for withholding approval.</P>
              <P>(iii) For projects estimated to cost less than $500,000 or 25% of the loan, whichever is less, the borrower may proceed with procurement upon completion of the P&amp;S.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the borrower has employed full competitive bidding in the selection, a contract may be executed with the successful bidder and the borrower may proceed to paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) If the borrower did not follow a fully competitive bidding process as described in § 1753.8, the selection, along with a summary of all proposals and an engineer's recommendation, shall be sent to RUS. RUS shall approve the proposal selection in writing or notify the borrower of any reason for withholding approval.</P>
              <P>(vi) The borrower sends three executed contracts including specifications to RUS for approval.</P>
              <P>(vii) After RUS approval of the contract, one copy will be returned to the borrower and one copy will be sent to the seller.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Equipment additions to existing systems.</E> Purchase procedures for equipment additions to existing systems are the same as for initial system purchase except that the borrower may negotiate for equipment of a specific type and manufacture instead of obtaining proposals from three or more sellers.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">New system additions.</E> (i) The borrower prepares the P&amp;S and, if the project is estimated to exceed $500,000 or 25% of the loan, whichever is less, sends two copies to the GFR for approval. The borrower may request RUS approval to negotiate for the purpose of standardization on a system basis prior to preparing the P&amp;S.<PRTPAGE P="430"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) RUS notifies the borrower in writing as to whether the borrower may negotiate for specific equipment. If P&amp;S were required to be submitted to RUS under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, RUS notifies the borrower in writing of P&amp;S approval (or notifies the borrower of the reasons for withholding approval).</P>
              <P>(iii) The remainder of the purchase procedure for new system additions is the same as for initial equipment purchase.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contract amendments.</E> (1) The general requirements for contract amendments are set forth in § 1753.11.</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower shall prepare any required amendments to the special equipment contract, arrange for the execution by all parties, and submit these amendments to RUS in accordance with § 1753.11(d). RUS Form 238, Construction or Equipment Contract Amendment, shall be used for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Closeout procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acceptance tests for RUS Contract Form 395 with installation.</E> (i) Immediately upon completion of the installation and alignment of the equipment, the borrower shall arrange with the contractor's installer and the GFR for acceptance tests.</P>
              <P>(ii) The borrower shall obtain from the contractor, in writing, the results of all inspections and tests made by the contractor as required in the specifications. The borrower will analyze the test results and determine whether the performance of the equipment meets the contract specifications.</P>

              <P>(a) RUS Form 773 shall be used for minor construction by contract. Compensation may be based upon unit prices, hourly rates, or another basis agreed to in advance by the borrower and the contractor. A single work project may require more than one contractor.</P>
              <P>(b) The borrower shall prepare the contract form and attach any diagrams, sketches and tabulations necessary to specify clearly the work to be performed and who shall provide which materials. Neither the selection of the contractor nor the contract requires RUS approval.</P>
              <P>(c) Borrowers are urged to obtain quotations from several contractors before entering into a contract to be assured of obtaining the lowest cost. The borrower must ensure that the contractor selected meets all Federal and State licensing and bonding requirements, and that the contractor maintains the insurance coverage required by the contract for the duration of the work. (See 7 part CFR 1788)</P>
              <P>(d) Upon completion and final inspection of the construction the borrower shall obtain from the Contractor a final invoice and an executed copy of RUS Form 743, Certificate of Contractor and Indemnity Agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) RUS Contract Form 773 may also be used to contract for the maintenance and repair of telephone equipment and facilities. Generally, RUS will not finance maintenance and repair contracts.</P>

              <P>(a) If the borrower performs minor construction financed with loan funds, the borrower's regular work order procedure shall be used to administer construction activities that may be performed entirely by a contractor under <PRTPAGE P="432"/>Form 773 contract, by work order, or jointly by work order and one or more contractors under Form 773 contracts.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS financing under Form 773 contracts dated in the same calendar year is limited to the following amounts for the following discrete categories of minor construction. The date of the Form 773 contract is the date the Form 773 contract is executed.</P>
              <P>(1) For outside plant construction, the limit is $500,000 or ten per cent (10%) of the borrower's previous calendar year's outside plant total construction, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(2) For central office equipment, the limit is $500,000.</P>
              <P>(3) For equipment and buildings, the limit is $250,000 in each category.</P>
              <P>(c) A single minor construction project may be a discrete element of a somewhat larger overall project, such as the provision and installation of a standby power generator or heating/air conditioning equipment in connection with a building modification or expansion project or the splicing on a major cable placement project. It cannot be a portion, by dividing into smaller segments, of a discrete major construction project, such as the placement of a continuous cable facility.</P>
              <P>(d) RUS approval must be obtained in advance for minor construction unless all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) RUS has approved the engineering design.</P>
              <P>(2) All standard RUS procedures are followed, including the application of RUS construction practices (see § 1753.6).</P>
              <P>(3) The Standard Form 773 contract is used without modification.</P>
              <P>(e) The borrower shall determine the scope of each proposed construction project and decide how it will be constructed. A work project number shall be assigned to which all charges for that project are referenced.</P>
              <P>(f) The borrower shall maintain accounting and plant records sufficient to document the cost and location of all construction and to support loan fund advances and disbursements.</P>
              <P>(g) Normally the borrower will finance minor construction with general funds and obtain reimbursement with loan funds when construction is completed and executed Form 771 has been submitted to RUS. If a borrower satisfies RUS of its inability to finance the construction temporarily with general funds, RUS may establish, on a case by case basis, a work order fund for specific construction projects. The work order fund will be closed upon receipt of an FRS and the executed Forms 771 for the specific projects for which the work order fund was established.</P>
              <P>(h) RUS will advance funds to finance minor construction work projects only if all necessary documents, including an FRS and supporting data covering the project, are received within one year of the date construction of the project is completed.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon completion and prior to closeout, minor construction must be inspected and certified to be in compliance with RUS construction standards, to be reasonable in cost, and to meet applicable codes. The certification is made by an experienced telephone engineer who is either licensed in the state where the inspection will be performed, or is a borrower's staff engineer, who meets the requirements of the “employee in charge” of force account engineering as described in subpart B of this part. The GFR will periodically audit the inspection of minor construction to ensure integrity of the procedure. RUS borrowers with less than 2000 subscribers may use the above procedure or have construction inspection performed by the GFR.</P>
              <P>(b) Engineering services for minor construction may be contracted using RUS Form 245, Engineering Service Contract—Special Services. Costs for these services may be included in the costs for construction on the Form 771. (See subpart B of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) Upon completion of construction, the borrower shall obtain the engineer's certification on RUS Form 771. An official of the borrower, designated by the board of directors, shall also <PRTPAGE P="433"/>execute the borrower's certification on Form 771.</P>

              <P>(c) Generally, the factors which RUS will consider in selecting borrowers for the certification program will include:</P>
              <P>(1) The experience of the staff of the borrower.</P>
              <P>(2) The RUS assessment of the borrower's ability to handle the certification program requirements considering the size and complexity of the proposed construction in the LD.</P>
              <P>(3) The history of the borrower in following RUS's policies and procedures.</P>
              <P>(4) Other factors deemed relevant by RUS.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as specifically stated in this subpart, certification borrowers must comply with all requirements applicable to other borrowers.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Field trials.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as covered in Bulletin 345-3, no loan funds shall be advanced for any product if any item to be included in the project is not included in the “List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Telephone Systems of RUS Borrowers,” RUS Bulletin 344-2. When new items of materials or equipment are considered for acceptance by RUS or when a previously accepted item has been subjected to such major modifications that its suitability cannot be determined based on laboratory data and/or field experience, a field trial shall be required if RUS so determines. This field trial consists of limited field installations of the materials or equipment in closely monitored situations designed to determine, to RUS's satisfaction, their operational effectiveness under actual field conditions. Field trials are to be used only as a means for determining, to RUS's satisfaction, the operational effectiveness of a new or revised product under actual field conditions. Both the manufacturer and borrower are responsible for assuring that the field trial is carried out and that the required information on the product's performance is received by RUS in a timely manner. The use of materials or equipment derived from new inventions or concepts untried within the telephone industry is defined as “an experiment” and shall be handled as a special case using procedures considered appropriate by RUS to meet the individual experiment.</P>
            <P>(b) To qualify for a field trial, the new and improved materials and equipment must appear to RUS to offer one or more of the following benefits:</P>
            <P>(1) Improved performance.</P>
            <P>(2) Decreased cost.</P>
            <P>(3) Broader application.</P>
            <P>(c) The item of material or equipment subject to field trial may be only part of the total amount of materials or equipment included in a bid or it may be the key component of the facility or system provided; therefore, RUS shall have authority to require that a satisfactory plan be provided to maintain or restore service in the event that the materials and equipment fail to meet established performance requirements. RUS shall limit the quantity of new materials and equipment installed on any field trial and shall also limit the number of field trials for a given product to what RUS considers reasonable to provide the necessary information.</P>
            <P>(d) A borrower may participate in a field trial only if, in RUS's opinion, the borrower possesses:</P>
            <P>(1) Adequate financial resources so that no delay in the project will result from lack of funds.</P>
            <P>(2) The financial stability to overcome difficulties which may result from an unsuccessful field trial. The borrower must be able to restore and maintain service until the manufacturer meets its financial obligations with respect to the field trial.</P>

            <P>(3) Qualified personnel to enable it to discharge its responsibilities.<PRTPAGE P="437"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) A record satisfactory to RUS for maintaining equipment and plant facilities and for providing RUS with information when requested.</P>
            <P>(5) Willingness to participate in the field trial and awareness of the effort and responsibility this entails.</P>
            <P>(e) The test site for the field trial shall be, in RUS's opinion, readily accessible and provide the conditions, such as temperature extremes, high probability of lightning damage, etc., for which the product is being evaluated. The material or equipment involved shall be covered by an RUS specification or a suitable standard acceptable to RUS. The supplier is required to submit test data to show conformance with the applicable specification or standard. Further testing shall be performed if required by RUS personnel.</P>
            <P>(f) A field trial shall normally continue for a minimum of six months, or for a longer period of time determined by RUS to be required to obtain conclusive data that the item either fulfills all requirements or is unacceptable. Either the borrower or supplier may terminate a field trial at any time, in accordance with their contractual agreement. Such termination, if prior to the time required by RUS, shall constitute withdrawal of the product from consideration by RUS. RUS has authority to terminate field trials based on its determination that the equipment is not performing satisfactorily and that this lack of performance may, in RUS's opinion, cause service degradation or hazards to life or property.</P>
            <P>(g) Field trials shall be conducted in accordance with the instructions set forth in this regulation and the agreement relating to the specific application. Both the supplier and the borrower shall agree, and obtain RUS approval before the start of the trial, on the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The specific purpose of the field trial;</P>
            <P>(2) Ownership of items during trial;</P>
            <P>(3) Starting date and duration;</P>
            <P>(4) Responsibility for costs and removal of items in the event of noncompliance with the specification or purpose intended and arrangements for service continuity or restoration;</P>
            <P>(5) Responsibility for testing, test equipment and normal operation and maintenance during the trial period;</P>
            <P>(6) Availability of test equipment on site during the trial period; and</P>
            <P>(7) Responsibility for spare parts and components consumed during the trial period.</P>
            <P>(h) Both the supplier and the borrower shall keep RUS informed of the status of a field trial. These reports shall not be limited to details of problems of failures encountered during installation and subsequent operation but shall include information on progress of the field trial. If these reports are not received in accordance with the requirements of the RUS Form 399b, RUS shall have the authority to deny or suspend loan funds related to these products until the delinquent reports are received.</P>
            <P>(i) Before a borrower purchases materials or equipment that require a field trial, prior approval must be obtained from RUS and RUS Form 399b, RUS Telecommunications Equipment Field Trial (available from the Director, Administrative Services Division, Rural Utilities Service, Room 0175, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250) will be completed by RUS and must be signed by both the borrower and supplier as an indication that they understand their responsibilities in the field trial. Assurance must also be obtained from RUS that the “particular item” that is the subject of the field test is eligible for a field trial. To obtain this assurance, any proposal for use of an item on a field trial basis shall be forwarded to the Chief, Area Engineering Branch, for review and approval.</P>
            <P>(j) Procedures for establishing field trials for the various categories of equipment after RUS has approved the 399b:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Electronic transmission equipment.</E> The procedure set forth in Bulletin 385-2 “Purchasing and Installing Special Electronic Equipment” shall be followed except that the Special Equipment Contract (Including Installation), RUS Form 397, shall be used in all purchases of electronic equipment for field trials. In addition, the borrower and supplier shall execute three copies of a <PRTPAGE P="438"/>“Supplemental Agreement to Equipment Contract for Field Trial,” RUS Form 399, or a “Supplemental Agreement to Equipment Contract for Field Trial (Secondary—Delivery, Installation, Operation)”, RUS Form 399a, as well as three copies of the RUS Form 399b, “RUS Telecommunications Equipment Field Trial”, and forward them, together with three copies of the executed contract and specifications, to the Chief, Area Engineering Branch. A limited number of copies of RUS Forms 399, 399a, and 399b are available from RUS upon request from the Director, Administrative Services Division, Rural Utilities Service, Room 0175, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Only Rural Utilities Service (RUS) accepted filled cable and splicing materials shall be used on outside plant projects financed by RUS.</P>
            <P>(2) The installation instructions provided by the manufacturer of splicing materials shall be followed except where those instructions conflict with the procedures specified in this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Precautions shall be taken to prevent the ingress of moisture and other contaminants during all phases of the splicing installation. When an uncompleted splice must be left unattended, it shall be sealed to prevent the ingress of moisture and other contaminants.</P>
            <P>(4) Minor sheath damage during construction may be repaired if the repair is completed immediately and approved by the borrower's resident project representative. Minor damage is typically repaired by:</P>
            <P>(i) Scuffing the cable sheath associated with the damaged area;</P>
            <P>(ii) Applying several layers of DR tape over the scuffed and damaged area;</P>
            <P>(iii) Applying several layers of plastic tape over the DR tape; and</P>
            <P>(iv) If damage is severe enough to rupture the cable shield, a splice closure shall be installed.</P>
            <P>(5) All splice cases installed on RUS toll trunk and feeder cables shall be filled, whether aerial, buried, or underground.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Splicing considerations for copper cables</E>—(1) <E T="03">Preconstruction testing.</E> It is desirable that each reel of cable be tested for grounds, opens, shorts, crosses, and shield continuity before the cable is installed. However, manufacturer supplied test results are acceptable. All cable pairs shall be free from electrical defects.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Handling precautions.</E> The cable manufacturer's instructions concerning pulling tension and bending radius shall be observed. Unless the cable manufacturer's recommendation is more stringent, the minimum bending radius shall be 10 times the cable diameter for copper cables and 20 times the cable diameter for fiber optic cables.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cable sheath removal.</E> (i) The length of cable sheath to be removed shall be governed by the type of splicing hardware used. Follow the splice case manufacturer's recommendations. For pedestals or large pair count splice housings, consider removing enough cable sheath to allow the conductors to extend to the top of the pedestal and then to hang downward to approximately 15 centimeters (cm) (6 inches (in.)) above the baseplate.</P>
            <P>(ii) Caution shall be exercised to avoid damaging the conductor insulation when cutting through the cable shield and removing the shield. Sharp edges and burrs shall be removed from the cut end of the shield.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Shield bonding and grounding.</E> For personnel safety, the shields of the cables to be spliced shall be bonded together and grounded before splicing activities are started. (See paragraphs (g)(2), and (g)(5)(i) through (g)(5)(iii) of this section for final bonding and grounding provisions.)</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Binder group identification.</E> (i) Color coded plastic tie wraps shall be placed loosely around each binder group of cables before splicing operations are attempted. The tie wraps shall be installed as near the cable sheath as practicable and shall conform to the same color designations as the binder ribbons. Twisted wire pigtails shall not be used to identify binder groups due to potential transmission degradation.</P>
            <P>(ii) The standard insulation color code used to identify individual cable pairs within 25-pair binder groups shall be as shown in Table 1:</P>

            <P>(6) <E T="03">Cleaning conductors.</E> It is not necessary to remove the filling compound from cable conductors before splicing. However, it is permissible to wipe individual conductors with clean paper towels or clean cloth rags. No cleaning chemicals, etc., shall be used. Caution shall be exercised to maintain individual cable pair and binder group identity. Binder group identity shall be maintained by using color coded plastic tie wraps. Individual pair identification shall be maintained by carefully twisting together the two conductors of each pair.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Expanded plastic insulated conductor (PIC) precautions.</E> Solid PIC and expanded (foam or foam skin) PIC are spliced in the same manner, using the same tools and materials and, in general, should be treated the same. However, the insulation on expanded PIC is much more fragile than solid PIC. Twisting or forming expanded PIC into extremely compact splice bundles and applying excessive amounts of tension when tightening tie wraps causes shiners and, thus shall be avoided.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Splice connectors.</E> (i) Only RUS accepted filled splice connectors shall be used on outside plant projects financed by RUS.</P>
            <P>(ii) Specialized connectors are available for splicing operations such as butt splices, in line splices, bridge taps, clearing and capping, and multiple pair splicing operations. The splice connector manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed concerning connector selection and use.</P>
            <P>(iii) Caution shall be exercised to maintain conductor and pair association both during and after splicing operations.</P>
            <P>(iv) Splicing operations that involve pairs containing working services shall utilize splice connectors that permit splicing without the interruption of service.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Piecing out conductors.</E> Conductors may be pieced-out to provide additional slack or to repair damaged conductors. However, the conductors shall be pieced-out with conductors having the same gauge and type and color of insulation. The conductors used for piecing-out shall be from cables having RUS acceptance.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Splice organization.</E> Spliced pair bundles shall be arranged in firm lay-ups with minimum conductor tension in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Binder tape.</E> Perforated nonhygroscopic and nonwicking binder tape should be applied to splices housed in filled splice cases. The binder tape allows the flow of filling compound while holding the splice bundles near the center of the splice case to allow adequate coverage of filling compound.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Cable tags.</E> Cables shall be identified by a tag indicating the cable manufacturer's name, cable size, date of placement, and generic route information. Information susceptible to changes caused by future cable throws and rearrangements should not be included. Tags on load coil stubs shall include the serial number of the coil case, the manufacturer's name, and the inductance value.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Screened cable.</E> Screened PIC cable is spliced in the same manner as nonscreened PIC cable. However, special considerations are necessary due to differences in the cable design. The transmit and receive bundles of the cable shall be separated and one of the bundles shall be wrapped with shielding material in accordance with the cable manufacturer's recommendations. When acceptable to the cable manufacturer, it is permissible to use either the scrap screening tape removed from the cable during the sheath opening process provided the screening tape is edge coated or new pressure sensitive aluminum foil tape over polyethylene tape.<PRTPAGE P="446"/>
            </P>
            <P>(14) <E T="03">Service wire connections.</E> (i) Buried service wires may be spliced directly to cable conductors inside pedestals using the same techniques required for branch cables. Buried service wires may also be terminated on terminal blocks inside pedestals in areas where high service order activity or fixed count cable administration policies require terminal blocks. However, only RUS accepted terminal blocks equipped with grease or gel filled terminations to provide moisture and corrosion resistance shall be used.</P>
            <P>(ii) Only filled terminal blocks having RUS acceptance shall be used on aerial service wire connections.</P>
            <P>(15) <E T="03">Copper cable testing.</E> Copper cable testing shall be performed in accordance with RUS Bulletin 345-63, “RUS Standard for Acceptance Tests and Measurements of Telephone Plant,” PC-4, (Incorporated by reference at § 1755.97).</P>
            <P>(16) <E T="03">Cable acceptance.</E> Installed cable shall be tested and pass the inventory and acceptance testing specified in the Telephone System Construction Contract (Labor and Materials), RUS Form 515. The tests and inspections shall be witnessed by the borrower's resident project representative. All conductors shall be free from grounds, shorts, crosses, splits, and opens.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Splice arrangements for copper cables</E>—(1) <E T="03">Service distribution closures.</E> (i) Ready access closures permit cable splicing activities and the installation of filled terminal blocks for service wire connections in the same closure. Ready access designs shall allow service technicians direct access to the cable core as well as the terminal block.</P>
            <P>(ii) Fixed count terminals shall restrict service technician access to the cable core. Predetermined cable pairs shall be spliced to the terminal leads or stub cable in advance of service assignments.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Aerial splices.</E> Aerial splice cases accommodate straight splices, branch splices, load coils, and service distribution terminals. Aerial splicing arrangements having more than 4 cables spliced in the same splice case are not recommended. Stub cabling to a second splice case to avoid a congested splice is acceptable.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Buried splices.</E> (i) Direct buried splice cases accommodate straight splices, branch splices, and load coils. Direct buried splices shall be filled and shall be used only when above ground splicing in pedestals is not practicable.</P>
            <P>(ii) A treated plank or equivalent shall be placed 15 cm (6 in.) above the buried splice case to prevent damage to the splice case from future digging. Where a firm base for burying a splice cannot be obtained, a treated plank or equivalent shall be placed beneath the splice case.</P>
            <P>(iii) Each buried splice shall be identified for future locating. One method of marking the splice point is the use of a warning sign. Another method is the burying of an electronic locating device.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">BD-type pedestals.</E> (i) BD-type pedestals are housings primarily intended to house, organize, and protect cable terminations incorporating splice connectors, ground lugs, and load coils. Activities typically performed in pedestals are cable splicing, shield bonding and grounding, loading, and connection of subscriber service drops.</P>
            <P>(ii) The recommended splice capacities for BD-type pedestals are shown in Table 5. However, larger size pedestals are permissible if service requirements dictate their usefulness. Table 5 is as follows:</P>

            <P>(10) <E T="03">Central office tip cable splices.</E> (i) Filled cable or filled splices are not recommended for use inside central offices, except in cable vault locations. Outside plant cable sheath and cable filling compound are susceptible to fire and will support combustion. Fire, smoke, and gases generated by these materials during burning are detrimental to telephone switching equipment.</P>
            <P>(ii) Tip cables should be spliced in a cable vault. However, as a last resort, tip cables may be spliced inside a central office if flame retardant splice cases or a noncombustible central office splice housing is used to contain the splice.</P>

            <P>(iii) Splices inside the central office shall be made as close as practical to <PRTPAGE P="452"/>the point where the outside plant cables enter the building.

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Splicing considerations for fiber optic cables</E>—(1) <E T="03">Connection characteristics.</E> Splicing efficiency between optical fibers is a function of light loss across the fiber junctions measured in decibels (dB). A loss of 0.2 dB in a splice corresponds to a light transmission efficiency of approximately 95.5 percent.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Fiber core alignment.</E> Fiber splicing techniques shall be conducted in such a manner that the cores of the fibers will be aligned as perfectly as possible to allow maximum light transmission from one fiber to the next. Without proper alignment, light will leave the fiber core and travel through the fiber cladding. Light outside the fiber core is not a usable light signal. Core misalignment is illustrated in Figure 6:</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Splice loss.</E> (i) Splice loss can also be caused by fiber defects such as nonidentical core diameters, cores not in center of the fiber, and noncircular cores. Such defects are depicted in Figure 7:</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Handling precautions.</E> The following precautions shall be observed:</P>
            <P>(i) Avoid damaging the cable during handling operations prior to splicing. Minor damage may change the transmission characteristics of the fibers to the extent that the cable section will have to be replaced;</P>
            <P>(ii) The cable manufacturer's recommendations concerning pulling tension shall be observed. The maximum pulling tension for most fiber optic cable is 2669 newtons (600 pound-force);</P>
            <P>(iii) The cable manufacturer's recommendations concerning bending radius shall be observed. Unless the cable manufacturer's recommendation is more stringent, the minimum bending radius for fiber optic cable shall be 20 times the cable diameter;</P>
            <P>(iv) The cable manufacturer's recommendations concerning buffer tube bending radius shall be observed. Unless the cable manufacturer's recommendation is more stringent, the minimum bending radius for buffer tubes is usually between 38 millimeters (mm) (1.5 in.) and 76 mm (3.0 in.). The bending limitations on buffer tubes are intended to prevent kinking. Buffer tube kinking may cause excessive optical loss or fiber breakage; and</P>
            <P>(v) Handle unprotected glass fibers carefully to avoid introducing flaws such as scratched or broken fibers.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Personnel safety.</E> The following safety precautions shall be observed:</P>

            <P>(i) Safety glasses shall be worn when handling glass fibers;<PRTPAGE P="455"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Never view open-ended fibers with the naked eye or a magnifying device. Improper viewing of a fiber end that is transmitting light may cause irreparable eye damage; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Dispose of bare scrap fibers by using the sticky side of a piece of tape to pick up and discard loose fiber ends. Fiber scraps easily penetrate the skin and are difficult to remove.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Equipment requirements.</E> (i) Fiber optic splices shall be made in areas where temperature, humidity, and cleanliness can be controlled. Both fusion and mechanical splicing techniques may require a splicing vehicle equipped with a work station that will allow environmental control.</P>
            <P>(ii) Both fusion and mechanical splicing techniques are permitted on RUS financed projects. When using the mechanical splicing technique, only RUS accepted mechanical fiber optic splice connectors can be used.</P>
            <P>(iii) Fusion splicing machines shall be kept in proper working condition. Regular maintenance in accordance with the machine manufacturer's recommendations shall be observed.</P>
            <P>(iv) Mechanical splicing tools shall be in conformance with the tool manufacturer's recommendations.</P>
            <P>(v) An optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) shall be used for testing splices. The OTDR shall be stationed at the central office or launch point for testing individual splices as they are made and for end-to-end signature tests for the fiber optic link.</P>
            <P>(vi) An optical power meter shall be used for end-to-end cable acceptance tests.</P>
            <P>(vii) A prerequisite for the successful completion of a fiber optic splicing endeavor is the presence of a talk circuit between the splicing technician in the splicing vehicle and the operator of the OTDR in the central office. The splicing technician and the OTDR operator shall have access to communications with each other in order to inform each other as to:</P>
            <P>(A) Which splices meet the loss objectives;</P>
            <P>(B) The sequence in which buffer tubes and fibers are to be selected for subsequent splicing operations; and</P>
            <P>(C) The timing required for the performance of OTDR testing to prevent making an OTDR test at the same time a splice is being fused.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Cable preparation.</E> (i) Engineering work prints shall prescribe the cable slack needed at splice points to reach the work station inside the splicing vehicle. Consideration should be given to the slack required for future maintenance activity as well as initial construction activities. The required slack may be different for each splice point, depending on the site logistics. However, the required slack is seldom less than 15 meters (50 feet). The amount of slack actually used shall be recorded for each splice point to assist future maintenance and restoration efforts.</P>
            <P>(ii) The splice case manufacturer's recommendations concerning the amount of cable sheath to be removed shall be followed to facilitate splicing operations. The length of the sheath opening shall be identified with a wrap of plastic tape.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the cable contains a rip cord, the cable jacket shall be ring cut approximately 15 cm (6 in.) from the end and the 15 cm (6 in.) of cable jacket shall be removed to expose the rip cord. The rip cord shall be used to slit the jacket to the tape mark.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the cable does not contain a rip cord, the cable jacket shall be slit using a sheath splitter. No cuts shall be made into the cable core nor shall the buffer tubes be damaged.</P>
            <P>(v) If the cable contains an armor sheath, the outer jacket shall be opened along the slit and the jacket shall be removed exposing the armor sheath. The armor shall be separated at the seam and pulled from the cable exposing the inner jacket. The armor shall be removed making allowances for a shield bond connector. The inner sheath shall be slit using a sheath splitter or rip cord. The cable core shall not be damaged nor shall there be any damage to the buffer tubes. The jacket shall be peeled back and cut at the end of the slit. The exposed buffer tubes shall not be cut, kinked, or bent.</P>
            <P>(vi) After the cable sheath has been removed, the binder tape shall be removed from the cable. The cable shall not be crushed or deformed.</P>

            <P>(vii) The buffer tubes shall be unstranded one at a time. The buffer tubes shall not be kinked.<PRTPAGE P="456"/>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test sample preparation.</E> Prepare the sample by removing the jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap for sufficient distance to allow one end to be accessed for test connections. Cut out a series of 6 millimeter (0.25 inch) diameter holes along the test sample, at 30 centimeters (1 foot) intervals progressing successively 90 degrees around the circumference of the cable. Assure that the cable core is exposed at each hole by slitting the core wrapper. Place the prepared sample in a dry vessel which when filled will maintain a one meter (3 foot) head of water over 6 meters (20 feet) of uncoiled cable. Extend and fasten the ends of the cable so they will be above the water line and the pairs are rigidly held for the duration of the test.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Capacitance testing.</E> Measure the initial values of mutual capacitance of all odd pairs in each cable at a frequency of 1 kilohertz before filling the vessel with water. Be sure the cable shield or shield/armor is grounded to the test equipment. Fill the vessels until there is a one meter (3 foot) head of water on the cables.</P>
              <P>(i) Remeasure the mutual capacitance after the cables have been submerged for 24 hours and again after 30 days.</P>

              <P>(b) Test per Option A or Option B—(i) <E T="03">Option A.</E> Weigh the sample and closure prior to testing. Fill the closure with water and place under a continuous pressure of 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Collect the water leakage from the end of the test sample during the test and weigh to the nearest 0.1 gram. Immediately after the one hour test, seal the ends of the cable with a thin layer of grease and remove all visible water from the closure, being careful not to remove water that penetrated into the core during the test. Reweigh the sample and determine the weight of water that penetrated into the core. The weight of water that penetrated into the core must not exceed 8 grams.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Option B.</E> Fill the closure with a 0.2 gram sodium fluorscein per liter water solution and apply a continuous pressure 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Catch and weigh any water that leaks from the end of the cable during the one hour period. If no water leaks from the sample, carefully remove the water from the closure. Then carefully remove the jacket, shield or shield/armor and core wrap <PRTPAGE P="483"/>one at a time, examining with an ultraviolet light source for water penetration. After removal of the core wrap, carefully dissect the core and examine for water penetration within the core. Where water penetration is observed, measure the penetration distance. The distance of water penetration into the core must not exceed 127 millimeters (5.0 inches).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Insulation compression test</E>—(a) <E T="03">Test Sample D.</E> Remove jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap being careful not to damage the conductor insulation. Remove one pair from the core and carefully separate, wipe off core filler, and straighten the insulated conductors. Retwist the two insulated conductors together under sufficient tension to form 10 evenly spaced 360 degree twists in a length of 10 centimeters (4 inches).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sample testing.</E> Center the mid 50 millimeters (2 inches) of the twisted pair between 2 smooth rigid parallel metal plates that are 50 millimeters × 50 millimeters (2 inches × 2 inches). Apply a 1.5 volt direct current potential between the conductors, using a light or buzzer to indicate electrical contact between the conductors. Apply a constant load of 67 newtons (l5 pound-force) on the sample for one minute and monitor for evidence of contact between the conductors.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Surge Test.</E> (a) One length of sample F must be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of F must be used to measure the core to shield breakdown.</P>
              <P>(b) The samples must be capable of withstanding without damage, a single surge voltage of 20 kilovolts peak between conductors, and a 35 kilovolts peak surge voltage between conductors and the shield or shield/armor as hereinafter described. The surge voltage must be developed from a capacitor discharged through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants must be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microsecond wave shape.</P>
              <P>(c) The shape of the generated wave must be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the cable sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample.

            <P>(4) For RUS acceptance consideration of a LC, the manufacturer must certify and demonstrate that all requirements specified in this section are available and in compliance with this section.</P>
            <P>(5) Certain requirements are included in this section for features which may not be needed for every application. Such features are identifiable by the inclusion in the requirements of some such phrase as “when specified by the owner” or “as specified by the owner.” In some cases where an optional feature will not be required by an owner, either now or in the future, a system which does not provide this feature shall be considered to be in compliance with the specification for the specific installation under consideration, but not in compliance with the entire specification.</P>
            <P>(6) The owner may properly request bids from any supplier of an RUS accepted LC whose system provides all the features which will be required for a specific installation.</P>
            <P>(7) When required by the owner, the supplier shall state compliance to the Carrier Serving Area (CSA) requirements, as stated in Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) Standard TR-TSY-000057, Functional Criteria for Digital Loop Carrier Systems.</P>

The failure rate for the equipment shall be less than 0.5 percent per month of all equipped cards in all system terminals after 6 months. A failure is considered to be the failure of a component on the PC board which requires it to be repaired or replaced.</P>
            <P>(2) The line concentrator terminal units shall be designed such that there will be no more than 4 hours of total outages in 20 years.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">System type acceptance tests.</E> General test results will be required on each system type. Any system provided in accordance with this section shall be capable of meeting any requirement in this section on a spot-check basis.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Features required.</E> The network control equipment and peripheral equipment shall be comprised of solid-state and integrated circuitry components as far as practical and in keeping with the state-of-the-art and economics of the subject system.</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Ringing.</E> (i) When LC ringing is generated at the remote end, it shall be automatic and intermittent and shall be cut off from the called line upon removal of the handset at the called station during either the ringing or silent period.</P>
            <P>(ii) When ringing generators are provided in the LC on an ancillary basis, they shall be accepted or technically accepted by RUS.</P>
            <P>(iii) Where ringing is generated at the remote end, the ringing system shall provide sufficient ringing on a bridged basis over the voltage and temperature limits of this specification and over subscriber loops within the limits stated by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall state the minimum number (not less than two) of main station ringers that can be used for each ringing option available.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Traffic.</E> (1)(i) The minimum grade of service for traffic in the line concentrator shall be B =. 005 using the Traffic Table, based on the Erlang Lost-Calls-Cleared Formula. Required grade of service, traffic assumptions and calculations for the particular application being implemented shall be supplied by the bidder.</P>
            <P>(ii) Service to customers served by a traffic sensitive LC should not be noticeably different than the service to customers served by the dedicated physical pairs from the central office so that uniform grade of service will be provided to all customers in any class of service. Reference § 1755.522(p)(1)(i), RUS General Specification for Digital, Stored Program Controlled Central Office Equipment.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Traffic and Plant Registers.</E> Traffic measurements consist of three types—peg count, usage, and congestion. A peg count register scores one count per call attempt per circuit group such as trunks, digit receivers, senders, etc. Usage counters measure the traffic density in networks, trunks and other circuit groups. Congestion registers score the number of calls which fail to find an idle circuit in a trunk group or to find an idle path through the switching network when attempting to connect two given end points. These conditions constitute “network blocking.”<PRTPAGE P="488"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) When required, traffic data will be stored in electronic storage registers or a block of memory consisting of one or more traffic counters for each item to be measured. The bidder shall indicate what registers are to be supplied, their purpose and the means for displaying the information locally (or at a remote location when available).</P>

The telephone set is assumed to have a resistance of 200 ohms.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Impedance—subscriber loops.</E> For the purpose of this section, the input impedance of all subscriber loops served by the equipment is arbitrarily considered to be 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarad capacitor at voice frequencies.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Battery noise.</E> Noise across the remote terminal battery at power panel distribution bus terminals shall not exceed 35 dBrnC during the specified busy hour.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Stability.</E> The long-term allowable variation in loss through the line concentrator system shall be ±0.5 dB from the loss specified by the bidder.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Return loss.</E> The specified return loss values are determined by the service and type of port at the measuring end. Two-wire ports are measured at 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarads, and 4-wire ports are measured at 600 ohms resistive. When other balance networks are supplied, test equipment arranged for operation with the supplied network(s) may be used. The requirement given shall meet the following cited values on each balance network available in the system:

            <P>(iii) Electrical protection requirements for line concentrator equipment can be summarized briefly as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) Current surge tests simulate the stress to which a relatively low impedance path may be subjected before main frame protectors break down. Paths with a 100 Hz impedance of 50 ohms or less shall be subjected to current surges, employing a 10 × 1000 microsecond waveshape as defined in Figure 3 of this section, Surge Waveshape. For the purpose of determining this impedance, arresters which are mounted within the equipment are to be considered zero impedance. The crest current shall not exceed 500A; however, depending on the impedance of the test specimen this value of current may be lower. The crest current through the sample, multiplied by the sample's 100 Hz impedance, shall not exceed 1000 V. Where sample impedance is less than 2 ohms, peak current shall be limited to 500A as shown in Figure 4 of this section, Current Surge Tests. Figures 3 and 4 follow:</P>

            </GPH>
            <P>(B) Sixty Hertz (60 Hz) current carrying tests shall be applied to simulate an ac power fault which is conducted to the unit over the cable pairs. The test shall be limited to 10 amperes Root Mean Square (rms) of 60 Hz ac for a period of 11 cycles (0.1835 seconds) and shall be applied longitudinally from line to ground.</P>

            <P>(C) AC power service surge voltage tests shall be applied to the power input terminals of ac powered devices <PRTPAGE P="495"/>to simulate switching surges or lightning-induced transients on the ac power system. The test shall employ a 1.2 × 50 microsecond waveshape with a crest voltage of 2500 V. Communications line protectors may be left in place for these tests.</P>
            <P>(D) Voltage surge tests which simulate the voltage stress to which a relatively high impedance path may be subjected before primary protectors break down and protect the circuit. To ensure coordination with the primary protection while reducing testing to the minimum, voltage surge tests shall be conducted at a 1000 volts with primary arresters removed for devices protected by carbon blocks, or the + 3 sigma dc breakdown voltage of other primary arresters. Surge waveshape should be 10 × 1000 microseconds.</P>
            <P>(E) Arrester response delay tests are designed to stress the equipment in a manner similar to that caused by the delayed breakdown of gap type arresters when subjected to rapidly rising voltages. Arresters shall be removed for these tests, the peak surge voltage shall be the + 3 sigma breakdown voltage of the arrester in question on a voltage rising at 100 V per microsecond, and the time for the surge to decay to half voltage shall equal at least the delay time of the tube as explained in Figure 5 of this section, Arrester Response Delay Time as follows:</P>

            <P>(v) A minimum of five applications of each polarity for the surge tests and three for the 60 Hz Current Carrying Tests are the minimum required.

            <P>(a) Acceptance tests outlined in §§ 1755.400 through 1755.407 are applicable to plant constructed by contract or force account. This testing standard provides for the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Specific types of tests or measurements for the different types of telecommunications plant and equipment;</P>
            <P>(2) The method of measurement and types of measuring equipment;</P>
            <P>(3) The expected results and tolerances permitted to meet the acceptable standards and objectives;</P>
            <P>(4) Suggested formats for recording the results of the measurements and tests; and</P>
            <P>(5) Some probable causes of nonconformance and methods for corrective action, where possible.</P>
            <P>(b) Alternative methods of measurements that provide suitable alternative results shall be permitted with the concurrence of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS).</P>

            <P>(c) For the purpose of this testing standard, a “measurement” shall be <PRTPAGE P="509"/>defined as an evaluation where quantitative data is obtained (e.g., resistance in ohms, structural return loss in decibels (dB), etc.) and a “test” shall be defined as an evaluation where no quantitative data is obtained (e.g., a check mark indicating conformance is usually the result of the test).</P>
            <P>(d) The sequence of tests and measurements described in this standard have been prepared as a guide. Variations from the sequence may be necessary on an individual application basis.</P>
            <P>(e) There is some overlap in the methods of testing shown; also, the extent of each phase of testing may vary on an individual basis. The borrower shall determine the overall plan of testing, the need and extent of testing, and the responsibility for each phase of testing.</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicable results.</E> (1) For the CO and RST, the resistance after the bond has been made to the MGB electric service ground shall not exceed 5 ohms. Where the measured ground resistance exceeds 5 ohms, the borrower shall determine what additional grounding, if any, shall be provided.</P>

            <P>(2) For electronic equipment, the ground resistance shall not exceed 25 ohms. Where the measured ground resistance exceeds 25 ohms, the borrower shall determine what additional grounding, if any, shall be provided.<PRTPAGE P="511"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) When ground resistance measurements exceed the ground resistance requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, refer to RUS Bulletin 1751F-802, “Electrical Protection Grounding Fundamentals,” for suggested methods of reducing the ground resistance.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Data record.</E> Results of the CO and RST ground resistance measurements shall be recorded. A suggested format similar to Format I, Outside Plant Acceptance Tests—Subscriber Loops, in § 1755.407 or a format specified in the applicable construction contract may be used. Results of the electronic equipment ground resistance measurements shall be recorded. A suggested format similar to Format II, Outside Plant Acceptance Tests—Trunk Circuits, in § 1755.407 or a format specified in the applicable construction contract may be used. Data showing approximate moisture content of the soil at the time of measurement, the temperature, the type of soil and a description of the test equipment used shall also be included.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Probable causes for nonconformance.</E> Refer to RUS Bulletin 1751F-802, “Electrical Protection Grounding Fundamentals,” and Telecommunications Engineering and Construction Manual (TE&amp;CM) Section 810, “Electrical Protection of Electronic Analog and Digital Central Office Equipment,” for possible causes of nonconformance and suggested methods for corrective action.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Shield or shield/armor continuity.</E> (1) Tests and measurements shall be made to ensure that cable shields or shield/armors are electrically continuous. There are two areas of concern. The first is shield or shield/armor bonding within a pedestal or splice and the second is shield or shield/armor continuity between pedestals or splices.</P>
            <P>(2) Measurement techniques outlined here for verification of shield or shield/armor continuity are applicable to buried cable plant. Measurements of shield continuity between splices in aerial cable plant should be made prior to completion of splicing. Conclusive results cannot be obtained on aerial plant after all bonds have been completed to the supporting strand, multigrounded neutral, etc.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Method of measurement.</E> (i) The shield or shield/armor resistance measurements shall be made between pedestals or splices using either a Wheatstone bridge or a volt-ohm meter. For loaded plant, measurements shall be made on cable lengths that do not exceed one load section. For nonloaded plant, measurements shall be made on cable lengths that do not exceed 5,000 feet (ft) (1,524 meters (m)). All bonding wires shall be removed from the bonding lugs at the far end of the cable section to be measured. The step-by-step measurement procedure shall be as shown in Figure 2.</P>
            <P>(ii) Cable shield or shield/armor continuity within pedestals or splices shall be measured with a cable shield splice continuity test set. The step-by-step measurement procedure outlined in the manufacturer's operating instructions for the specific test equipment being used shall be followed.</P>

If the IR then meets the minimum requirements, the conductor will be considered satisfactory. Immediately following the IR tests, all arrester units which have been removed shall be reinstalled.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> (i) IR measurements shall be made with either an insulation resistance test set or a direct current (dc) bridge type megohmmeter.<PRTPAGE P="517"/>

            <P>(iii) The dc bridge type megohmmeter, which may be alternating current (ac) powered, shall have scales and multiplier which make it possible to accurately read IR from 1 megohm to 1 gigohm. The voltage applied to the conductors under test shall not exceed “250 volts dc” when using an instrument having adjustable test voltage levels. This will help to prevent breakdown of lightning arresters.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicable results.</E> (i) For all new insulated cable or wire facilities, the expected IR levels are normally greater than 1,000 to 2,000 megohm-mile (1,609 to 3,218 megohm-km). A value of 500 megohm-mile (805 megohm-km) at 68 °F (20 °C) shall be the minimum acceptable value of IR. IR varies inversely with the length and the temperature.</P>
            <P>(ii) The megohm-mile (megohm-km) value for a conductor may be computed by multiplying the actual scale reading in megohms on the test set by the length in miles (km) of the conductor under test.</P>
            <P>(iii) The objective insulation resistance may be determined by dividing 500 by the length in miles (805 by the length in km) of the cable or wire conductor being tested. The resulting value shall be the minimum acceptable meter scale reading in megohms.</P>
            <P>(iv) Due to the differences between various insulating materials and filling compounds used in manufacturing cable or wire, it is impractical to provide simple factors to predict the magnitude of variation in insulation resistance due to temperature. The variation can, however, be substantial for wide excursions in temperature from the ambient temperature of 68 °F (20 °C).</P>

            <P>(v) Borrowers should be certain that tip and ring IR measurements of each pair are approximately the same. Borrowers should also be certain that IR measurements are similar for cable or wire sections of similar length and cable or wire type. If some pairs measure significantly lower, borrowers should attempt to improve these pairs in accordance with cable manufacturer's recommendations.

            <P>(ii) Should the cable or wire fail to meet the 500 megohm-mile (805 megohm-km) requirement when the temperature is known to be approximately 68 °F (20 °C) there is not yet justification for rejection of the cable or wire. Protectors, lightning arresters, etc., may be a source of low insulation resistance. These devices shall be removed from the cable or wire and the cable or wire IR measurement shall be repeated.

            <P>(D) Compare the calculated dc loop resistance at the measurement temperature to the measured dc loop resistance to determine compliance with the requirement specified in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) Resistance varies directly with temperature change. For copper conductor cables, the dc resistance changes by ±1% for every ±5 °F (2.8 °C) change in temperature from 68 °F (20 °C).</P>
            <P>(iv) The dc resistance unbalance between the individual conductors of a pair shall not exceed that value which will result in a circuit balance of less than 60 dB when computed from noise measurements as described in paragraph (e) of this section. It is impractical to establish a precise limit for overall circuit dc resistance unbalance due to the factors controlling its contribution to circuit noise. These factors include location of the resistance unbalance in relation to a low impedance path to ground (close to the central office) and the magnitude of unbalance in short lengths of cable making up the total circuit length. The objective is to obtain the minimum unbalance throughout the entire circuit when it is ascertained through noise measurements that dc resistance unbalance may be contributing to poor cable balance.</P>
            <P>(v) Pairs with poor noise balance may be improved by reversing tip and ring conductors of pairs at cable splices. Where dc resistance unbalances are systematic over the total trunk circuit or loop circuit length, tip and ring reversals may be made at frequent intervals. Where the unbalances are concentrated in a shorter section of cable, only one tip and ring reversal should be required. Concentrated dc resistance unbalance produces maximum circuit noise when located adjacent to the central office. Concentrated dc resistance unbalance will contribute to overall circuit noise at a point approximately two-thirds (<FR>2/3</FR>) of the distance to the subscriber. All deliberate tip and ring reversals shall be tagged and identified to prevent plant personnel from removing the reversals when resplicing these connections in the future. The number of tip and ring reversals shall be held to a minimum.</P>
            <P>(vi) A systematic dc resistance unbalance can sometimes be accompanied by other cable parameters that are marginal. Among these are pair-to-pair capacitance unbalance, capacitance unbalance-to-ground, and 150 kilohertz (kHz) crosstalk loss. Engineering judgment has to be applied in each case. Rejection of cable for excessive dc resistance unbalance shall only apply to a single reel length, or shorter.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Data record.</E> The measurement data for dc loop resistance and dc resistance unbalance shall be recorded. Suggested formats similar to Format I for subscriber loops and Format II for trunk circuits in § 1755.407 or formats <PRTPAGE P="522"/>specified in the applicable construction contract may be used.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Probable causes for nonconformance.</E> Dc loop resistance and dc resistance unbalance are usually the result of the resistance of individual conductors used in the manufacture of the cable. Resistance unbalance can be worsened by defective splicing of the conductors (splicing connectors, improper crimping tool, etc.).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Subscriber loop measurement (loop checking).</E> (1) When specified by the borrower, insertion loss and noise measurements shall be performed on subscriber loops after connection of a line circuit to the loop by the one person method using loop checking equipment from the customer access location. For this method, the central office should be equipped with a 900 ohm plus two microfarad quiet termination and a milliwatt generator having the required test frequencies; or a portable milliwatt generator having the desired frequencies may be used, especially, where several small offices are involved.</P>
            <P>(2) At a minimum, insertion loss and frequency response of subscriber loop plant shall be measured at 1,000, 1,700, 2,300, and 2,800 Hertz (Hz). When additional testing frequencies are desired, the additional frequencies shall be specified in the applicable construction contract.</P>

            <P>(G) For loaded subscriber loops, the 1 kHz loss shall be approximately 0.45 dB per 100 ohms of measured dc loop resistance. This loss shall be the measured loss less the net gain of any voice frequency repeaters in the circuit. Testing shall also be conducted to verify that the loss increases gradually as the frequency increases. The loss on H88 loaded loops should be down only slightly at 2.8 kHz but drop rapidly above 2.8 kHz. The loss on D66 loaded loops shall be fairly constant to about 3.4 kHz and there shall be good response at 4.0 kHz. When voice frequency repeaters are in the circuit there will be some frequency weighting in the build-out network and the loss at the higher frequencies will be greater than for nonrepeatered loops.</P>
            <P>(H) For nonloaded subscriber loops, the 1 kHz loss shall be approximately 0.9 dB per 100 ohms of measured dc loop resistance. Testing shall also be conducted to verify that the loss is approximately a straight line function with no abrupt changes. The 3 kHz loss should be approximately 70% higher than the 1 kHz loss.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Noise.</E> The principal objective related to circuit noise (noise-metallic) and the acceptance of new plant is that circuit noise levels be 20 dBrnc or less (decibels above reference noise, C-message weighted (a weighting derived from listening tests, to indicate the relative annoyance or speech impairment by an interfering signal of frequency (f) as heard through a “500-type” telephone set)). For most new, properly installed, plant construction, circuit noise will usually be considerably less than 20 dBrnc unless there are unusually long sections of telephone plant in parallel with electric power facilities and/or power influence of paralleling electric facilities is abnormally high. When circuit noise is 20 dBrnc or less, the loop plant shall be considered acceptable. When measured circuit noise is greater than 20 dBrnc, loop plant shall still be considered acceptable providing circuit balance (power influence reading minus circuit noise readings) is 60 dB or greater and power influence readings are 85 dBrnc or greater. When circuit noise is greater than 20 dBrnc and circuit balance is less than 60 dB and/or power influence is less than 85 dBrnc, loop plant shall not be considered acceptable and the loop plant shall be remedied to make circuit balance equal to or greater than 60 dB.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Data record.</E> Measurement data shall be recorded. A suggested format similar to Format I for subscriber loops in § 1755.407 or a format specified in the applicable construction contract may be used.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Probable causes for nonconformance</E>—(i) <E T="03">Insertion loss.</E> Some of the more common causes for failing to obtain the desired results may be due to reversed load coil windings, missing load coils, bridge taps between load coils, load coil spacing irregularities, excessive end sections, cables having high or low mutual capacitance, load coils having the wrong inductance, load coils inadvertently installed in nonloaded loops, moisture or water in cable, split pairs, and improperly spliced connections. The above factors can occur singularly or in combination. Experience to date indicates that the most common problems are missing load coils, reversed load coil windings or bridge taps.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Noise.</E> Some of the common causes for failing to obtain the desired results may be due to high power influence from paralleling electrical power systems, poor telephone circuit balance, discontinuous cable shields, inadequate bonding and grounding of cable shields, high capacitance unbalance-to-ground of the cable pairs, high dc loop resistance unbalance, dc loop current less than 20 milliamperes, etc. The <PRTPAGE P="528"/>above factors can occur singularly or in combination. See TE&amp;CM Section 451, Telephone Noise Measurement and Mitigation, for steps to be taken in reducing telecommunications line noise.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">One-person open circuit measurement (subscriber loops).</E> (1) When specified by the borrower, open circuit measurements shall be made on all loaded and nonloaded subscriber loops upon completion of the cable work to verify that the plant is free from major impedance irregularities.</P>
            <P>(2) For loaded loops, open circuit measurements shall be made using one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(i) Impedance or pulse return pattern, with cable pair trace compared to that of an artificial line of the same length and gauge. For best results, a level tracer or fault locator with dual trace capability is required;</P>
            <P>(ii) Return loss using a level tracer, with cable pair compared to an artificial line of the same length and gauge connected in lieu of a Precision Balance Network (PBN). This method can be made with level tracers having only single trace capability; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Open circuit structural return loss using a level tracer. This method can be made with level tracer having only single trace capability.</P>
            <P>(3) Of the three methods suggested for loaded loops, the method specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section is the preferred method because it can yield both qualitative and quantitative results. The methods specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(iii) of this section can be used as trouble shooting tools should irregularities be found during testing.</P>
            <P>(4) For nonloaded loops, open circuit measurements shall be made using the method specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Method of measurement.</E> Open circuit measurements shall be made at the CO on each loaded and nonloaded pair across the tip and ring terminals of the pair under test. All CO equipment shall be disconnected at the MDF for this test. For loaded loops containing voice frequency repeaters installed in the CO or field mounted, the open circuit measurement shall be made after the repeaters have been disconnected. Where field mounted repeaters are used, the open circuit measurement shall be made at the repeater location in both directions.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Impedance or pulse return pattern.</E> The step-by-step measurement procedure using the impedance or pulse return pattern for loaded and nonloaded loops shall be as shown in Figure 8. An artificial line of the same makeup as the cable to be tested shall be set up. The traces of the impedance or pulse return pattern from the cable pair and the artificial line shall be compared and should be essentially identical. If the impedance or pulse return traces from the cable pair are different than the artificial line trace, cable faults are possible. When the cable pair trace indicates possible defects, the defects should be identified and located. One method of identifying and locating defects involves introducing faults into the artificial line until its trace is identical with the cable trace.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Return loss balanced to artificial line.</E> The step-by-step measurement procedure using the return loss balanced to artificial line for loaded loops shall be as shown in Figure 9. An artificial line of the same makeup as the cable to be tested shall be set up. The artificial line is connected to the external network terminals of the test set. The cable pair under test is compared to this standard. When defects are found, they should be identified and located by introducing faults into the artificial line. This is more difficult than with the method referenced in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section since this measurement is more sensitive to minor faults and only a single trace is used.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Open circuit structural return loss using level tracer.</E> The step-by-step measurement procedure using the level tracer for loaded loops shall be as shown in Figure 10. The cable pair is compared to a PBN.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> Equipment for performing these tests is shown in Figures 8 through 10. For loaded loops, artificial loaded lines must be of the same gauge and loading scheme as the line under test. For nonloaded loops, artificial nonloaded lines must be of the same gauge as the line under test. Artificial lines should be arranged using <PRTPAGE P="529"/>switches or other quick connect arrangements to speed testing and troubleshooting. Figures 8 through 10 are as follows:</P>

            <P>(7) <E T="03">Applicable results.</E> (i) For loaded and nonloaded loops, the two traces in the pulse return pattern or impedance method (paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section) shall be essentially identical. The degree of comparison required of the two traces is to be determined by experience.</P>
            <P>(ii) For loaded loops, results for return loss measurements using a level tracer, with artificial line, in lieu of a PBN (paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section) shall meet the following requirements:</P>

            <P>(A) For D66 and H88 loaded cables the structural return loss (SRL) values shall range between 28 and 39 dB, respectively, at the critical frequency of structural return loss (CFSRL) within the pass band of the loading system being used. The minimum SRL value for uniform gauge shall be 25 dB CFSRL. These SRL values apply for loaded cables of uniform gauge for the <PRTPAGE P="532"/>entire length of the subscriber loop circuit. Subscriber loop circuits shall meet the loading spacing deviations and the cable mutual capacitance requirements in the applicable RUS cable specifications;</P>
            <P>(B) For mixed gauge loaded cables the SRL values shall be 25 and 27 dB CFSRL, respectively, and the minimum SRL value shall be 22 dB CFSRL; and</P>
            <P>(C) The two traces in the pulse return pattern should be essentially identical. The degree of comparison required of the two traces is determined by experience.</P>
            <P>(iii) For loaded loops, the results of open circuit structural return loss measurements using a level tracer (paragraph (f)(5)(iii) of this section) shall meet the following requirements. For D66 and H88 loaded cables with uniform or mixed gauges, the worst value allowed for measured open circuit structural return loss between 1,000-3,500 Hz and 1,000-3,000 Hz, respectively, shall be approximately 0.9 dB (round trip) for each 100 ohms outside plant dc loop resistance including the resistance of the load coils. The value of 0.9 dB per 100 ohms for the round trip loss remains reasonably accurate as long as:</P>
            <P>(A) The subscriber end section of the loaded pair under test is approximately 2,250 ft (685 m) for D66 loading or 3,000 ft (914 m) for H88 loading in length; and</P>
            <P>(B) The one-way 1,000 Hz loss does not exceed 10 dB.</P>
            <P>(iv) For loaded loops, the measured value of open circuit structural return loss can only be as accurate as the degree to which the dc loop resistance of the loaded pair under test is known. Most accurate results shall be obtained when the dc loop resistance is known by actual measurements as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Furthermore, where the dc loop resistance is measured at the same time as the open circuit structural return loss, no correction for temperature is needed because the loss is directly proportional to the loop resistance. Where it is not practical to measure the dc loop resistance, it shall be calculated and corrected for temperature as specified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section. When measuring existing plant, care shall be taken to verify the accuracy of the records, if they are used for the calculation of the dc loop resistance. For buried plant, the temperature correction shall be based at the normal depth of the cable in the ground. (Temperature can be measured by boring a hole to cable depth with a ground rod, placing a thermometer in the ground at the cable depth, and taking and averaging several readings during the course of the resistance measurements.) For aerial cable it shall be based on the temperature inside the cable sheath.</P>
            <P>(v) For loaded loops, the best correlation between the measured and the expected results shall be obtained when the cable is of one gauge, one size, and the far end section is approximately 2,250 ft (685 m) for D66 loading or 3,000 ft (914 m) for H88 loading. Mixing gauges and cable sizes will result in undesirable small reflections whose frequency characteristics and magnitude cannot be accurately predicted. In subscriber loop applications, cable gauge may be somewhat uniform but the cable pair size most likely will not be uniform as cable pair sizes taper off toward the customer access location and a downward adjustment of 1 dB of the allowed value shall be acceptable. “Long” end sections (as defined in TE&amp;CM Section 424, “Guideline for Telecommunications Subscriber Loop Plant”) lower the expected value, a further downward adjustment of 3 dB in the allowed value shall be acceptable.</P>
            <P>(vi) For loaded loops, the limiting factor when making open circuit structural return loss measurements is when the 1,000 Hz one-way loss of the loaded cable pair under test becomes 10 dB or greater; it becomes difficult to detect the presence of irregularities beyond the 10 dB point on the loop. To overcome this difficulty, loaded loops having a one-way loss at 1,000 Hz greater than 10 dB shall be opened at some convenient point (such as a pedestal or ready access enclosure) and loss measurements at the individual portions measuring less than 10 dB one-way shall be made separately. When field mounted voice frequency repeaters are used, the measurement shall be made at the repeater location in both directions.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Data record.</E> (i) When performing a pulse return pattern or impedance open <PRTPAGE P="533"/>circuit measurement on loaded and nonloaded loops, a “check mark” indicating that the pair tests good or an “X” indicating that the pair does not test good shall be recorded in the SRL column. A suggested format similar to Format I for subscriber loops in § 1755.407 or a format specified in the applicable construction contract may be used.</P>
            <P>(ii) When performing open circuit return loss measurements using the return loss balanced to an artificial line or return loss using a level tracer on loaded loops, the value of the poorest (lowest numerical value) SRL and its frequency in the proper column between 1,000 and 3,500 Hz for D66 loading or between 1,000 and 3,000 Hz for H88 loading shall be recorded. A suggested format similar to Format I for subscriber loops in § 1755.407 or a format specified in the applicable construction contract may be used.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Probable causes for nonconformance.</E> Some of the more common causes for failing to obtain the desired results may be due to reversed load coil windings, missing load coils, bridge taps between load coils, load coil spacing irregularities, excessive end sections, cables having high or low mutual capacitance, load coils inadvertently installed in nonloaded loops, moisture or water in the cable, load coils having the wrong inductance, split pairs, and improperly spliced connectors. The above can occur singularly or in combination. Experience to date indicates that the most common problems are missing load coils, reversed load coil windings or bridge taps.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Cable insertion loss measurement (carrier frequencies).</E> (1) When specified by the borrower, carrier frequency insertion loss measurements shall be made on cable pairs used for T1, T1C, and/or station carrier systems. Carrier frequency insertion loss shall be made on a minimum of three pairs. Select at least one pair near the outside of the core unit layup. If the three measured pairs are within 10% of the calculated loss in dB corrected for temperature, no further testing is necessary. If any of the measured pairs of a section are not within 10% of the calculated loss in dB, all pairs in that section used for carrier transmission shall be measured.</P>

            <P>(a) The data transmission measurements listed in this section shall be used to determine the acceptability of trunk and nonloaded subscriber loop circuits for data modem transmission.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Signal-to-C notched noise (S/CNN) measurement.</E> (1) When specified by the borrower, S/CNN measurements shall be made on trunk circuits and nonloaded subscriber loops. For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.</P>
            <P>(2) S/CNN is the logarithmic ratio expressed in dB of a 1,004 Hz holding tone signal compared to the C-message weighted noise level. S/CNN is one of the most important transmission parameters affecting the performance of data transmission because proper modem operation requires low noise relative to received power level. Since modulated carriers are used in data communication systems, noise measurements need to be performed with power on the connection to activate equipment having signal-level-dependent noise sources. For 4 kHz channels, a 1,004 Hz holding tone is used to activate the signal-dependent equipment on the channel or connection.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Method of measurement.</E> The S/CNN measurement shall be made using a 1,004 Hz holding tone at −13 dBm0 (decibels relative to one milliwatt, referred to a zero transmission level point) and performed in accordance with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1.506-1990, American National Standard for Telecommunications—Network Performance—Transmission Specifications for Switched Exchange Access Network including supplement ANSI T1.506a-1992, and American National Standards Institute/Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ANSI/IEEE) 743-1984, IEEE Standard Methods and Equipment for Measuring the Transmission Characteristics of Analog Voice Frequency Circuits.

This nonlinear phase versus frequency characteristic of the transmission facility causes the various frequency components to travel at different transit times which results in successively transmitted data pulses to overlap at the receive end. The overlapping of the pulses at the receive end results in distortion of the received signal. Excessive EDD on the transmission facility may be reduced using data modems with equalization or by conditioning the transmission line.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Amplitude jitter (AJ) measurement.</E> (1) When specified by the borrower, AJ measurements shall be made on trunk circuits and nonloaded subscriber loops. For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.</P>
            <P>(2) AJ is any fluctuation in the peak amplitude value of a fixed tone signal at 1,004 Hz from its nominal value. AJ is expressed in peak percent amplitude modulation.</P>
            <P>(3) AJ is measured in two separate frequency bands, 4-300 Hz and 20-300 Hz. The 4-300 Hz band is important for modems employing echo canceling capabilities. The 20-300 Hz band is used for modems that do not employ echo cancelers.</P>
            <P>(4) Amplitude modulation can affect the error performance of voiceband data modems. The measurement of amplitude jitter indicates the total effect on the amplitude of the holding tone of incidental amplitude modulation and other sources including quantizing and message noise, impulse noise, gain hits, phase jitter, and additive tones such as single-frequency interference.</P>

For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.</P>
            <P>(2) PJ is any fluctuation in the zero crossings of a fixed tone signal (usually 1,004 Hz) from their nominal position in time within the voiceband. PJ is expressed in terms of either degrees peak-to-peak (° p-p) or in terms of a Unit Interval (UI). One UI is equal to 360° p-p.</P>
            <P>(3) PJ measurements are typically performed in two nominal frequency bands. The frequency bands are 20-300 Hz band and either the 2-300 Hz band or the 4-300 Hz band. The 20-300 Hz band is important to all phase-detecting modems. The 4-300 Hz band or the 2-300 Hz band is important for modems employing echo canceling capabilities.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Shield or armor ground resistance measurements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Shield or armor ground resistance measurements shall be made on completed lengths of copper cable and wire plant and fiber optic cable plant.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of measurement.</E> (1) The shield or armor ground resistance measurement shall be made between the copper cable and wire shield and ground and between the fiber optic cable armor and ground, respectively. The measurement shall be made either on cable and wire lengths before splicing and before any ground connections are made to the cable or wire shields or armors. Optionally, the measurement may be made on cable and wire lengths after splicing, but all ground connections must be removed from the section under test.</P>
            <P>(2) The method of measurement using either an insulation resistance test set or a dc bridge type megohmmeter shall be as shown in Figure 18 as follows:</P>
            <GPH DEEP="450" SPAN="2">
              <PRTPAGE P="550"/>

            </GPH>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Test equipment.</E> (1) The shield or armor ground resistance measurements may be made using an insulation resistance test set, a dc bridge type megohmmeter, or a commercially available fault locator.</P>
            <P>(2) The insulation resistance test set should have an output voltage not to exceed 500 volts dc and may be hand cranked or battery operated.</P>

            <P>(3) The dc bridge type megohmmeter, which may be ac powered, should have <PRTPAGE P="551"/>scales and multipliers which make it possible to accurately read resistance values of 50,000 ohms to 10 megohms. The voltage that is applied to the shield or armor during the test should not be less than “250 volts dc” nor greater than “1,000 volts dc” when using an instrument having adjustable test voltage levels.</P>
            <P>(4) Commercially available fault locators may be used in lieu of the above equipment, if the devices are capable of detecting faults having resistance values of 50,000 ohms to 10 megohms. Operation of the devices and method of locating the faults should be in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicable results.</E> (1) For all new copper cable and wire facilities and all new fiber optic cable facilities, the shield or armor ground resistance levels normally exceed 1 megohm-mile (1.6 megohm-km) at 68 °F (20 °C). A value of 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) at 68 °F (20 °C) shall be the minimum acceptable value of the shield or armor ground resistance.</P>
            <P>(2) Shield or armor ground resistance varies inversely with length and temperature. In addition other factors which may affect readings could be soil conditions, faulty test equipment and incorrect test procedures.</P>
            <P>(3) For the resistance test method and dc bridge type megohmmeter, the ohm-mile (ohm-km) value for the shield or armor ground resistance shall be computed by multiplying the actual scale reading in ohms on the test set by the length in miles (km) of the cable or wire under test.</P>

            <P>(4)(i) The objective shield or armor ground resistance may be determined by dividing 100,000 by the length in miles (161,000 by the length in km) of the cable or wire under test. The resulting value is the minimum acceptable meter scale reading in ohms. Examples for paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section are as follows:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Equation 1. Test Set: Scale Reading * Length = Resistance-Length</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">75,000 ohms * 3 miles = 225,000 ohm-mile</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(75,000 ohms * 4.9 km = 367,000 ohm-km)</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Equation 2. 100,000 ohm-mile ÷ Length = Minimum Acceptable Meter Scale Reading</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">100,000 ohm-mile ÷ 3 miles = 33,333 ohms</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(161,000 ohm-km ÷ 4.9 km = 32,857 ohms)</FP>
            
            <P>(ii) Since the 33,333 ohms (32,857 ohms) is the minimum acceptable meter scale reading and the meter scale reading was 75,000 ohms, the cable is considered to have met the 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) requirement.</P>
            <P>(5) Due to the differences between various jacketing materials used in manufacturing cable or wire and to varying soil conditions, it is impractical to provide simple factors to predict the magnitude of variation in shield or armor to ground resistance due to temperature. The variations can, however, be substantial for wide excursions in temperature from the ambient temperature of 68 °F (20 °C).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Data record.</E> The data shall be corrected to the length requirement of ohm-mile (ohm-km) and a temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) and shall be recorded on a form specified in the applicable construction contract.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Probable causes for nonconformance.</E> (1) When results of resistance measurements are below the 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) requirement at 68 °F (20 °C), the jacket temperature, soil conditions, test equipment and method shall be reviewed before the cable or wire is considered a failure. If the temperature is approximately 68 °F (20 °C) and soil conditions are acceptable, and a reading of less than 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) is indicated, check the calibration of the equipment; as well as, the test method. If the equipment was found to be out of calibration, recalibrate the equipment and remeasure the cable or wire. If the temperature was 86 °F (30 °C) or higher, the cable or wire shall be remeasured at a time when the temperature is approximately 68 °F (20 °C). If the test was performed in unusually wet soil, the cable or wire shall be retested after the soil has reached normal conditions. If after completion of the above steps, the resistance value of 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) or greater is obtained, the cable or wire shall be considered acceptable.</P>

            <P>(2) When the resistance value of the cable or wire is still found to be below 100,000 ohm-mile (161,000 ohm-km) requirement after completion of the steps listed in paragraph (f)(1) of this <PRTPAGE P="552"/>section, the fault shall be isolated by performing shield or armor ground resistance measurements on individual cable or wire sections.</P>
            <P>(3) Once the fault or faults have been isolated, the cable or wire jacket shall be repaired in accordance with § 1755.200, RUS Standard for Splicing Copper and Fiber Optic Cables or the entire cable or wire section may be replaced at the request of the borrower.</P>

            </P>

            <P>(j) If access to the building electric service grounding system, as referenced in paragraph (i) of this section, is not possible or is not reasonable (telecommunications primary station protector grounding conductor will be longer than 10 ft (3 m)), the NID, BET, or fused primary station protector shall be located as close as practicable to electrodes (a) or (b) cited in section 800-40(b)(1) of ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®.</P>
            <P>(k) In addition, the NID, BET, or fused primary station protector shall be located in, on, or immediately adjacent to the structure or building to be served as close as practicable to the point at which the telecommunications service wire attaches to the building, making sure that the telecommunications primary station protector grounding conductor is connected to the closest, existing, and accessible electrode, of the electrodes cited in paragraph (i) or (j) of this section.</P>

            <P>(l) For the preferred customer access location installation, the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, permits the telecommunications grounding conductor to be connected to the metallic conduit, service equipment closure, or electric grounding conductor as shown in Figure 8 of paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) Connections to metallic conduits shall be made by ground straps clamped over a portion of the conduit that has been cleaned by sanding down to bare metal.</P>

            <P>(2) Connections to metallic service equipment closures shall be made by attaching a connector which is listed for the purpose by some organization acceptable to the local authority (State, county, etc.) per article 100 of ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, definition for “Listed” (for example connectors listed for the purpose by Underwriters Laboratories (UL)). Figure 8 is as follows:</P>

              <GID>ER17AU01.009</GID>
            </GPH>

            <P>(m) Where it is not possible to accomplish the objective of paragraphs (i), (j), and (k) of this section, interior metallic pipes may be used to the maximum practicable extent to gain access to the electric service ground as shown in Figure 9. Note that the water pipe in Figure 9 is electrically continuous between electric and telecommunications bonds to the cold water pipe and it is used only as a portion of a bonding conductor and, therefore, does not have to be “acceptable” as a ground electrode but may be floating (isolated from ground by a plastic pipe section). ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, requires that metal piping be used as a bonding conductor in this manner only when <PRTPAGE P="585"/>the connectors to the pipe are within 1.5 m (5 ft) of where the pipe enters the premises. This is not the preferred installation. The RUS preferred installation has the telecommunications primary station protector grounded directly to an accessible location near the power grounding system. See paragraph (l) of this section. Figure 9 is as follows:</P>
            <GPH DEEP="425" SPAN="2">

            <PRTPAGE P="586"/>

            <P>(n) Where the telecommunications premises system at a customer's access location is grounded to a separate electrode (of any type) this telecommunications grounding electrode must be bonded to the electric grounding system with a No. 6 AWG or larger copper insulated grounding conductor. Bonding of separate electrodes is a requirement of the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®.</P>
            <P>(o) The NID, BET, or fused primary station protector pair size shall be selected for the number of lines anticipated within five years.</P>
            <P>(p) When lightning damage is considered probable or customer access locations are remote from the borrower's headquarters, use of maximum duty gas tube primary station protectors incorporated in NIDs, BETs, or fused primary station protectors should be considered. (See RUS TE&amp;CM 823, Electrical Protection by Use of Gas Tube Arresters). Copies of RUS TE&amp;CM 823 are available upon request from RUS/USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., STOP 1522, Washington, DC 20250-1522, FAX (202) 720-4120.</P>

            <P>(q) NIDs or BETs incorporating fuseless station protectors shall always be used in preference to fused station protectors or BETs incorporating fused protectors, when in the judgment of the RUS borrower or the engineer delegated by the RUS borrower, the requirements of ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, for fuseless station protectors can be met.</P>
            <P>(r) A fuse link consisting of a copper conductor two gauges (AWG) finer (numerically higher) conductivity than the aerial service wire shall be provided between the cable and aerial service wire where NIDs or BETs incorporating fuseless station protectors are used. Thus for a 22 AWG drop, a fuse link of No. 24 AWG or finer copper wire shall be provided. If the cable circuit is No. 24 gauge or finer, the cable conductors serve as the fuse link for the 22 AWG aerial service wire and no separate fuse link is necessary. (Note: The fuse link or the facilities serving as the fuse link must be located between the telecommunications facilities that are exposed to possible power cross and the customer drop where there is no exposure to possible power cross.)</P>
            <P>(s) RUS's buried plant practices require buried main line plant to be protected against power contacts to aerial plant extensions and aerial inserts by No. 24 AWG fuse links at every buried-aerial junction.</P>
            <P>(t) In aerial cable plant, fuse links are usually provided by No. 24 AWG leads on filled terminal blocks regardless of the gauge of the cable conductors. This practice is acceptable if the ampacity of the aerial service wire is sufficiently higher than the fuse link's ampacity.</P>
            <P>(u) The grounding and bonding of each NID, BET, or fused primary station protector shall be selected by consulting paragraphs (i) through (n) of this section. The “first choice” assembly unit shall be selected whenever the prevailing conditions make its use practicable. The NID, BET, or fused primary station protector assembly unit selected shall be installed in accordance with the appropriate construction drawing specified in RUS Bulletin 1753F-153 (RUS Form 515d), Specifications and Drawings for Service Installations at Customer Access Locations (Incorporated by reference at § 1755.97). Copies of RUS Bulletin 1753F-153 are available upon request from RUS/USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., STOP 1522, Washington, DC 20250-1522, FAX (202) 720-4120.</P>
            <P>(v) The minimum size grounding conductor that can be used with a single NID; a group of NIDs; a multipair NID; fused protector; or BET shall be in accordance Table 5, as follows:</P>

            <P>(2) Attaching and terminating devices for bonding conductors shall be adequate for the size of wire involved. The No. 6 AWG copper insulated conductor or larger shall not be terminated by bending it around a threaded stud.</P>
            <P>(dd) Where NID, BET, or fused station protector assembly units require a driven ground rod the following shall apply to the ground rod installation:</P>
            <P>(1) Locate the ground rod at least 1 ft (300 mm) from buildings, poles, trees and other obstruction;</P>

            <P>(2) Ground rods shall not be installed within 6 ft (2 m) of electric service ground rods (Note: This minimum separation is provided to avoid mutual impedance effects of multiple grounding electrodes that will deleteriously degrade the effective impedance-to-earth if grounding electrodes are installed any closer than 6 ft (2 m) to one another. This requirement is included for cases where the telecommunications company is not allowed, for some reason, to observe the RUS preferred grounding method of attaching the primary protector grounding conductor directly to an accessible point on the <PRTPAGE P="590"/>building electric service grounding system. RUS believes that if the primary protector location can be sited within 6 ft (2 m) of the electric service ground rod then the electric service ground rod could be used as the preferred telecommunications grounding electrode and a separate telecommunications ground rod is unnecessary);</P>
            <P>(3) A hole, 15 in. (350 mm) deep and 6 in. (150 mm) in diameter, shall be dug at the location where the ground rod is to be driven;</P>
            <P>(4) Where “slip-on” type ground rod clamps are used instead of “clamp-around” type clamps, the ground rod clamps shall be placed onto the rod prior to driving the rod into the ground (Note there should be one clamp for the NID, BET, or fused station protector grounding conductor and one clamp for the conductor required to bond the telecommunications ground rod to the electric grounding system). However, the clamp shall not be tightened until the rod is completely driven. The end of the rod shall be placed in the bottom of the hole and the rod shall be aligned vertically adjacent to one wall of the hole prior to driving. The rod shall be driven until its tip is 12 in. (300 mm) below final grade. The grounding conductor shall then be attached, the clamp shall be tightened, and hole backfilled. Clamps employed in this manner shall be suitable for direct burial and shall be RUS accepted or RUS technically accepted; and</P>
            <P>(5) Where rods are manually driven, a large number of blows from a light hammer (4 lbs (1.8 kg)) shall be used instead of heavy sledgehammer type blows. This should keep the rod from bending.</P>
            <P>(ee) Terminations on fuseless primary station protectors incorporated in NIDs and on fused primary station protectors shall be as shown in Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13 of paragraph (ee)(1) of this section, Figure 14 of paragraph (ee)(4) of this section, and Figure 15 of paragraph (ee)(6) of this section.

            <P>(a) Customer access location installations at mobile homes shall be treated the same whether the homes are mounted on permanent foundations or temporary foundations and shall be installed as specified in §§ 1755.500 through 1755.510. For the purpose of this section, mobile homes include manufactured homes, motor homes, truck campers, travel trailers, and all forms of recreational vehicles. Customer access location installations at mobile homes can be considerably different than customer access location installations at regular homes and borrowers shall be certain that the two types of installations are properly applied.</P>

            <P>(b) The method of customer access location installation prescribed by the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ® for a mobile home depends on how the electric power is installed at the mobile home and it can involve considerable judgment on the part of the telecommunications installer.

The ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, allows station protector installations to be at the location of the power meter or the electric disconnecting means apparatus serving the mobile home providing these electric facilities are installed in the manner specifically defined by the ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®. The ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, requires the station protectors to be installed at the nearest of a number of other meticulously defined ANSI/NFPA 70-1999, <E T="03">NEC</E> ®, acceptable electrodes where the protector cannot be installed at the power meter or the electric disconnecting means apparatus serving the mobile home. The provisions can be confusing.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reliability.</E> (1) Quality control and burn-in procedures shall be sufficient so the failure rate of printed circuit boards does not exceed an average of 1.0 percent per month of all equipped cards in the central office during the first three months after cutover, and an average of 0.5 percent per month of all equipped cards in the central office during any 6-month period thereafter. A failure is considered to be the failure of a component on the PC board which requires it to be repaired or replaced.</P>
            <P>(2) The central office switching system shall be designed such that the expected individual line downtime does not exceed 30 minutes per year. This is the interval that the customer is out of service as a result of all failure types, excluding dispatch and travel time, i.e., hardware, software, and procedural errors.</P>
            <P>(3) The central office switching system shall be designed such that there will be no more than 1 hour of total outages in 20 years, excluding dispatch and travel time for unattended offices.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">System type acceptance tests.</E> (1) System type acceptance tests (general acceptance tests) are performed for the purpose of determining whether or not a type of switching system should be added or retained as an RUS accepted system. While general acceptance tests will be required on each system type, they will not be expected to cover every requirement in this section. However, any installation of a system provided in accordance with this section shall be capable of meeting any requirement in this section on a spot-check basis.</P>
            <P>(2) A “completed call” test shall be made part of these system type acceptance tests. There shall be no more than two in 10,000 locally originating and incoming calls misdirected, unsuccessfully terminated, prematurely disconnected or otherwise failing as a result of equipment malfunction and/or equipment failures, or as a result of transients, noise or design deficiencies. This test shall be made with a load box with no less than 10 lines access and 10 subscriber numbers for completion, or equivalent, with no other traffic in the system. If there is a failure in the equipment during this test, the cause shall be repaired and the test restarted at zero calls.</P>
            <P>(3) System type acceptance testing applies basically to factory type testing, and not to owner acceptance testing for individual installations. The overall installed and operating system shall also meet these requirements, except for unusual circumstances or where specifically excluded by this or other RUS requirements.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Types of requirements.</E> (1) Unless otherwise indicated, the requirements listed in this section are fixed requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) Optional requirements are those which may not be needed for every office and are identifiable by a phrase such as, “when specified by the owner,” or, “as specified by the owner.”</P>
            <P>(3) In some cases where an optional feature specified in paragraph (e) of this section will not be required by an owner, either now or in the future, a system which does not provide this feature will be considered to be in compliance with this section for the specific installation under consideration, but not in compliance with the entire section.</P>
            <P>(4) The owner may request bids from any RUS accepted supplier whose system provides all the features which will be required for a specific installation.</P>
            <P>(5) The Application Guide, RUS TE&amp;CM 322, provides information about the economic and service factors involved in all optional features, as well as instructions for the completion of appendices A and B of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) The equipment shall provide for terminating and automatically interconnecting subscriber lines and trunks in response to dial pulses (or pushbutton dialing signals, if specified) without the aid of an operator.<PRTPAGE P="625"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Complete flexibility shall be provided for assigning any subscriber directory number to any central office line equipment by the use of internal programmed memory. Thus, any subscriber line and/or directory number may be moved to another terminal to distribute traffic loads, if the line equipment hardware is compatible with the service provided.</P>
            <P>(3) The system shall be arranged to interface with interexchange carrier trunks and networks using single digit or multi-digit access codes. The system shall be equipped to handle at least 20-digit subscriber dialed numbers. All subscriber directory numbers in the office shall be seven-digit numbers.</P>
            <P>(4) The network and the control equipment shall be comprised of solid-state and integrated circuitry components. Peripheral equipment shall be comprised of solid-state and integrated circuitry components as far as practical and consistent with the state-of-the-art and economics of the subject system.</P>
            <P>(5) The basic switching system shall include the provision of software programming and necessary hardware, including memory, for optional custom calling services such as call waiting, call forwarding, three-way calling, and abbreviated dialing. It shall be possible to provide these services to any individual line (single-party) subscriber. The addition of these services shall not reduce the anticipated ultimate engineered line, trunk, and traffic capacity of the switching system as specified in appendix A of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) The requirements in this specification apply only to single party lines. Although only single frequency ringing is required, other types may be requested in appendix A of this section.</P>
            <P>(7) Provision shall be made for local automatic message accounting (LAMA), and for traffic service position system (TSPS) trunks, or equivalent, to the operator's office when required either initially or in the future.</P>
            <P>(8) Tandem switching features shall be provided if specified in appendix A of this section.</P>
            <P>(9) The system shall be arranged to serve a minimum of eight All Number Calling (ANC) office codes per office, with discrimination on terminating calls by trunk group, numbering plan, or programmed memory and class mark, if specified in appendix A of this section.</P>
            <P>(10) Busy hour load handling capacity is an important feature when an office approaches capacity. The delays which may occur in call completion during busy hour periods may prove to be excessive in some system designs. Accordingly, each bidder shall provide, in appendix C of this section, data satisfactory to RUS regarding the busy hour load handling capacity and traffic delays of the system.</P>
            <P>(11) Provision shall be made for hotel-motel arrangements, as required by the owner, to permit the operation of message registers at the subscriber's premises to record local outdial calls by guests (see Item 10.5, appendix A of this section).</P>
            <P>(12) Provision shall be made to identify the calling line or incoming trunk on nuisance calls (see paragraph (g)(10) of this section for details).</P>
            <P>(13) Full access from every subscriber line to every interoffice trunk shall be provided.</P>
            <P>(14) Facilities shall be provided to implement service orders, make traffic studies, and perform switching and transmission tests by means of remote control devices if such operations are specified in Items 11.2 and 11.3 of appendix A of this section.</P>
            <P>(15) Provision shall be made for the addition of facilities to record all subscriber originated calls based on dialed directory number, time of day, and duration of conversation. They shall be such that the additional equipment (if any is required) may be added to an in-service system without interruption of service and a minimum of equipment, wiring and software modifications.</P>

            <P>(16) The system shall be capable of distributed switching operation where groups of subscriber lines can be remotely located from the central office. The remotely situated units are known as “Remote Switching Terminals” (RST's) (see paragraph (w) of this section). This does not eliminate the use of pair gain devices such as direct digitally connected concentrators, regular concentrators or subscriber carrier equipment, where specifically ordered by the owner and its engineer.<PRTPAGE P="626"/>
            </P>
            <P>(17) The switching system shall have means to synchronize its clock with switches above it in the network hierarchy, when specified by the owner in item 3, appendix A of this section (see paragraph (j) of this section).</P>
            <P>(18) Consistent with system arrangements and ease of maintenance, space shall be provided on the floor plan for an orderly layout of future equipment bays that will be required for anticipated traffic when the office reaches its ultimate size. Readily accessible terminals shall be provided for connection to interbay and frame cables to future bays. All cables, interbay and intrabay (excluding power), if technically feasible, shall be terminated at both ends by use of connectors.</P>
            <P>(19) When specified in appendix A of this section, the system shall be capable of processing emergency calls to a 911 service bureau connected either by a group of one-way 911 lines or a trunk group.</P>
            <P>(i) It shall be possible to reach the service bureau by dialing 911, 1 + 911, or a 7-digit number.</P>
            <P>(ii) The system shall select an idle 911 line or trunk.</P>
            <P>(iii) The system shall provide usual ringing and ringback signal until the called 911 line answers.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the calling line goes on-hook first, the system shall hold the connection from the called 911 line and return steady low tone to the service bureau. The system shall then begin a 45-minute timeout, after which the calling line is disconnected and an alarm message is printed on a TTY. If the calling line goes off-hook before timeout, the system shall reestablish the conversation path.</P>
            <P>(v) If the calling line does not disconnect, the service bureau attendant shall have the ability to force a disconnect of the established connection with the calling party.</P>
            <P>(vi) When the 911 call is answered, the equipment shall be arranged so that coin lines are not charged for the call. Similarly, if some form of local call charging is used, there shall be no charge for the 911 call.</P>
            <P>(vii) If the 911 service bureau is holding a calling line, it shall be possible for the 911 line to cause the equipment to ring back the calling line. This is done by providing a flash of on-hook signal from the 911 line lasting from 200 to 1,100 milliseconds. The signal to the calling line shall be ringing current if the line is on-hook, or receiver off-hook (ROH) tone if the line is off-hook.</P>
            <P>(viii) Calls shall not be originated from the service bureau via the dedicated 911 lines. If an attempt is made to originate a call, it shall receive reorder tone. After 6 minutes, the system shall print an alarm message.</P>
            <P>(ix) If 911 calls pass through intermediate switching, the forced-hold control, emergency ringback, and calling line status monitoring capabilities are lost.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Line circuit requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) The range of direct current (dc) resistances of subscriber loops, measured from the main frame in the central office and including the telephone set shall be at least 0-1900 ohms without loop extension and 1900-3600 ohms with loop extenders, or equivalent. The range when using extension equipment may be significantly reduced for straight line ringers. These limits apply under maximum adverse environmental and manufacturing variation tolerance conditions. Central office voltage shall be stabilized at a value necessary to provide at least a nominal 21 milliamperes current with a nontreated loop of at least 1900 ohms. Minimum loop insulation resistance without loop extenders shall be 25,000 ohms between conductors or from either conductor or both conductors in parallel to ground. Loop insulation resistance for loop extension devices may be 100,000 ohms minimum between conductors or from either conductor or both conductors in parallel to ground.</P>
            <P>(ii) In addition to operating on nonloaded cable pairs and subscriber carrier, the equipment shall function properly with D-66 and H-88 loaded cable pairs, including any provisions the equipment must control for the purposes of proper transmission.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Dialing</E>—(i) <E T="03">Subscriber dial speed.</E> The line equipment and central office equipment (COE) in tandem shall operate satisfactorily when used with subscriber dials having a speed of operation between eight and twelve impulses per second and a break period of <PRTPAGE P="627"/>55 to 65 percent of the total impulse period.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Subscriber dial interdigital time.</E> The line equipment and central office equipment shall operate satisfactorily with subscriber rotary dial interdigital times of 200 milliseconds minimum, and with pushbutton dialing interdigital times of 50 milliseconds minimum.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Subscriber line pushbutton dialing frequencies.</E> (A) The frequency pairs assigned for pushbutton dialing shall be as follows, with an allowable variation of ±1.5 percent:</P>

            <P>(B) The fault recorder shall provide a permanent or semi-permanent record of the circuit elements involved whenever a trouble is encountered. It shall be arranged to recognize an existing fault condition and not cause multiple printouts of the same fault, except during test routine.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Maintenance system.</E> (A) The maintenance system shall monitor and maintain the system operation without interruption of call processing, except for major failures.</P>
            <P>(B) The maintenance system shall provide both specialized maintenance hardware circuits and an extensive software package to enable maintenance to determine trouble to an individual card or functional group of cards.</P>
            <P>(C) Maintenance programs may be both on-line and off-line. On-line maintenance programs are activated by system errors and shall be scheduled to execute call tests during low traffic periods and periodic hardware tests at specific time intervals. Programs shall provide diagnostic tools for the maintenance personnel and be initiated by them.</P>

            <P>(D) Scheduled periodic hardware tests shall automatically detect faults and alert maintenance personnel via alarm or appropriate input/output device(s) at local and/or remote locations.<PRTPAGE P="636"/>
            </P>
            <P>(E) Facilities shall be provided so that test calls can be set up using pre-selected items of switching equipment.</P>
            <P>(F) The maintenance personnel shall be able to make tests to determine if every trunk and every item of switching equipment are functioning properly. Also, it shall be possible to make each trunk and each SPC equipment, or part thereof, busy to service calls. Where possible, equipment which is made busy to service calls shall still be accessible for test calls.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Outside plant and subscriber stations.</E> (A) A subscriber loop test set or equivalent shall be provided either as a separate set or as a part of the maintenance center, as specified in item 11.2 of appendix A of this section. This circuit shall include a high resistance volt-ohm meter, wiring to tip and ring terminals to permit a portable wheatstone bridge to be used, an operator's telephone circuit, a dial circuit (and pushbutton dialing keys, if specified), outgoing trunks to dial equipment for access to lines under test without use of the main distributing frame (MDF) test shoe and the necessary test keys. No dry cell batteries shall be accepted for test potentials. Circuits shall be designed so that alternating current (ac) induction on the line will have no effect on dc measurements. All functions shall be under control of lever or pushbutton keys. As a minimum the test system shall:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Test for bridged foreign electromotive force (EMF);</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Test for regular line battery;</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Ring the subscriber through the test access circuit or through a test shoe;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Test in and out of the central office; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">10</E>) Supply a reverse polarity key for voltage readings, except when positive or negative values are displayed directly.</P>
            <P>(B) An acceptable arrangement for making the tests shown in paragraph (o)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is to have them under software control with results displayed at one of the system's I/O ports.</P>
            <P>(C) A howler circuit for maintenance purposes, if ordered by the owner, shall have output tones which do not interfere with the pushbutton or multifrequency signaling tones. The harmonics of the output tones shall be attenuated at least 26 dB below the fundamental frequency for all load conditions. The frequency stability shall be 2 percent or less for all output tones when the unit is operated in the specified load and environmental range. It shall be possible to vary the output voltage (power) of the howler circuit. It shall remove tone and restore the line to service when the telephone instrument receiver is placed on-hook. The frequency of the output shall be chosen to be distinctive and urgent in order to attract the subscriber's attention to an off-hook situation.</P>
            <P>(D) When a dial speed test facility is specified by the owner, it shall be accessed by dialing a special code and shall return to the calling station readily identifiable signals to indicate that the dial speed is slow, normal, or fast.</P>
            <P>(E) When the office is arranged for pushbutton dialing, optional facilities shall be provided for testing the pushbutton dialing equipment at the subscriber station.</P>

            <P>(F) When a system for testing subscriber lines in remote offices from a test position in a centrally located office is specified by the owner, it shall be capable of working with all the central offices and RST's in the remote areas. This testing equipment shall preferably be solid-state with a minimum of electromechanical devices and shall operate from central office battery. It shall be capable of working over any voice grade telephone circuit and shall not require a dedicated trunk. There shall be no interference to or from “in-band” voice channel tones. When used over a network, the verification or access shall be guarded to prevent unauthorized access by subscribers. Access to this system shall only be available to the test operator in all cases.<PRTPAGE P="637"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Transmission testing.</E> (i) When transmission test circuits are specified in Item 11.3 of appendix A of this section, they shall permit testing of trunks by a distant office without any assistance in the local dial office. Analog test ports shall meet appropriate trunk requirements. If Centralized Automatic Reporting on Trunks (CAROT), or equivalent, is to be used, the equipment at the end office shall comply with Bellcore document SR-TSV-002275, BOC Notes on the LEC Networks—1990, section 8, Item 2.</P>
            <P>(ii) Transmission test circuits are available with a variety of options. These include single frequency and multifrequency tone generators with one or more generator output terminals, quiet terminations, and loop around test arrangements for both one-way and two-way trunks.</P>
            <P>(iii) Where multifrequency generators are used, they are usually arranged to provide a minimum of three frequencies. With some equipment, up to seven additional frequencies may be provided if needed. No industry standardization of test frequencies is as yet provided. Therefore, it is important that the selection of frequencies, the order in which they are applied and the time interval for application of each frequency be agreed upon by the connecting company and the RUS borrower and listed in appendix A of this section in those situations where connecting companies request the installation of multifrequency generators in borrowers' central offices.</P>
            <P>(iv) The milliwatt generator shall be solid-state and generate the analog or digital equivalent of 1004 Hz. The milliwatt generator shall be assigned to a 4-wire analog test port or be digitally generated. All 2-wire and 4-wire voice frequency ports are at a nominal 0 dBm0 level. The level of the 1004 Hz tone generator shall appear at outgoing 2-wire and 4-wire ports at 0 dBm ±0.5 dB. For direct digital connections, the encoded output shall be the digital equivalent of a 0 dBm0 ±0.5 dB signal.</P>
            <P>(v) Reference tone generators can be used individually or they can be part of a loop around test arrangement. If both single frequency and multifrequency reference tone generators are to be provided, only one can be arranged as part of a loop around test. Where a loop around arrangement is provided, the generator output can be obtained by dialing singly one of the two line terminals. By dialing the other line terminal singly, usually a 900 ohm resistor in series with a 2.16 microfarad capacitor is connected to the circuit under test to act as a “quiet termination” for noise measurements and other tests. Whenever both line terminals are held simultaneously, both the milliwatt supply and the quiet termination shall be lifted off and a “loop around” condition established. This permits the overall loss to be determined from the distant office by going out over one trunk, looping around in the end office and returning over the other trunk. The insertion loss of this test arrangement when used in a loop around configuration should not exceed 0.1 dB at the frequencies specified for the milliwatt supply. Unless otherwise specified, continuous off-hook supervision is to be provided on both line terminals to prevent collusive calling without charge. It will be permissible to accomplish the quiet termination by opening the 4-wire path internally and to accomplish the loop around by digital switching.</P>
            <P>(vi) Provision shall be made so that the milliwatt supply can be manually patched to circuits.</P>
            <P>(vii) Test jack access shall be provided for all interoffice trunks of the voice frequency type. The jack access shall be properly designated for line, drop, monitor, and signaling leads plus any other jacks as requested by the owner. This may be accomplished by a set of jacks located at the maintenance center which have access to each trunk on a switching basis.</P>
            <P>(p) <E T="03">Traffic</E>—(1) <E T="03">General engineering guidelines.</E> (i) The Traffic Table, based on the Erlang Lost-Calls-Cleared Formula, shall be used for determining the quantity of intraoffice paths, registers, and senders where full availability conditions apply. The following table shows the traffic capacity in CCS for 1 to 200 trunks at nine grades of service.<PRTPAGE P="638"/>

            <P>(ii) The traffic capacity for all interoffice trunks shall be based on full availability, even though the distant office itself is not engineered to provide full availability access.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Traffic Table may also be used to determine the approximate traffic capacity of high-usage intertoll trunks. The traffic offered to high-usage groups may be read at B.10, signifying that 10 percent of the traffic overflows to the alternate route. This approximates the HU12 table used by AT&amp;T.</P>
            <P>(iv) In reading the trunk quantity from the table, the higher quantity shall be used when the CCS load is three or more CCS over the lower quantity. For example, the number of trunks justified for 294 CCS at B.005 is 16, but for 295 CCS 17 trunks are justified.</P>
            <P>(v) Limited availability is not permitted.</P>
            <P>(vi) The traffic capacity in the following table should be used for small trunk groups such as pay station, special service trunks, intercept, and PBX trunks, unless otherwise specified in appendix A of this section:</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Grade of service.</E> (i) Grade of service specifies the expected performance when there are adequate service facilities for an assumed volume of traffic. It is expressed as a portion of the total traffic during a busy hour that cannot be terminated immediately or within a predetermined time period due to congestion. This places responsibility on the traffic engineers to specify facilities which will be entirely satisfactory to the users and which can be equipped at a price which will be accepted as reasonable.</P>
            <P>(ii) The number of calls encountering dial tone delay in excess of 3 seconds, measured over the busy hour of the four high-consecutive week (4HW) period, shall not be more than 1.5 percent.</P>
            <P>(iii) The average post dialing delay objective for an intraoffice call shall not exceed 1 second. This includes all connect, operate, and translation time.</P>
            <P>(iv) The line to line (intraoffice) network matching loss objective shall be 0.02 or less.</P>
            <P>(v) The blocking probabilities related to trunks include both “mismatch” probability and probability of “all trunks busy.” It is likely that the “mismatch” will be negligible in that many digital central offices have essentially nonblocking switching characteristics. The objectives for trunk connections are as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) Subscriber to outgoing trunk objective 0.01 or less;</P>
            <P>(B) Incoming trunk to subscriber objective 0.02 or less; and</P>
            <P>(C) Local trunk tandem objective 0.01 or less.</P>
            <P>(vi) Groups of common service circuits are to be engineered utilizing the full availability traffic tables that appear in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of this section at the following stipulated probabilities:</P>
            <P>(A) Outgoing trunks to 2/6 MF or dial pulse senders at B.001;</P>
            <P>(B) Incoming trunks to 2/6 MF receivers at B.001;</P>
            <P>(C) Incoming nondelay dial trunks to receivers at B.001; and</P>
            <P>(D) Incoming trunks with start dial at B.01.</P>
            <P>(vii) Remote Switching Terminals (RST's) shall meet the same grade of service objectives as the host.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Holding times.</E> For the purpose of estimating the quantity of common control circuits, the following average holding times may be used. These holding times are conservative and represent the average effective and ineffective call. If these holding times are to be used, it must be so stated in appendix A of this section.</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Traffic data requirements.</E> (i) Traffic measurements are composed of primarily two types—counts and usage. The following types of traffic data recording are required:</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Peg count</E> registers shall be incremented when a successful network connection is established to a particular circuit group such as trunks, senders, digital receivers, etc.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Overflow count</E> registers shall be incremented when access to a particular circuit group is denied due to all resource busy condition.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Network blockage count</E> registers shall be incremented due to an unavailability of a path in an access or switching matrix network.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Usage</E> measurements of the length of time associated with a particular setup event or network connection shall be made. Usage data measurements are normally collected by scanning circuit groups resources every 10 or 100 seconds to determine busy/idle states. Measurements are accumulated and read directly in CCS (hundred call seconds).</P>
            <P>(E) <E T="03">Service delay</E> measurements shall provide percentage counts of the calls for a particular service that are delayed beyond a specified interval of time, e.g., calls not receiving dial tone within 3 seconds after call origination.</P>

            <P>(ii) Traffic data shall be stored in electronic storage registers or block of memory consisting of one or more traffic counters for each item to be measured. The registers listed in paragraph (p)(4)(i) of this section shall be associated with the interoffice trunks, switching network and central control equipment in such a manner that the register readings can be used to determine the traffic load and flow to, from and within the system. Two-way <PRTPAGE P="642"/>trunks shall be metered to indicate inward and outward seizures. The bidder shall indicate what registers are to be supplied and their purpose.</P>
            <P>(iii) The measured data shall be shown on a printout. It should be possible to have local or remote printout, or both. Arrangement shall be made for automatic data printout on command for 15-, 30-, or 60-minute intervals as required, and be arranged for automatic start-stop and in accordance with revenue separation procedures current at the time of contract.</P>
            <P>(iv) All traffic records shall have dates and times and office identification.</P>
            <P>(q) <E T="03">Transmission</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The transmission characteristics will be governed by the fact that the switching matrix will be based on digital operation. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements are in terms of analog measurements made from Main Distributing Frame (MDF) to MDF terminals, excluding cabling loss.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Impedance.</E> For the purpose of this section, the nominal input impedance of analog ports in an end office shall be 900 ohms for 2-wire ports and 600 ohms for 4-wire ports. Where the connecting facility or equipment is other than this impedance, suitable impedance matching shall be provided by the bidder when specified by the owner.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Insertion loss.</E> The insertion loss in both directions of transmission at 1004 Hz shall meet the following requirements when measured with a 0 dBm input signal at 900 ohms (or 600 ohms, when required) at a temperature of 77 °F ±9 °F (25 °C ±5 °C).</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Trunk-to-trunk or trunk-to-line.</E> The loss shall be set between 0 and 0.5 dB for 2-wire to 2-wire, 2-wire to 4-wire, or 4-wire to 4-wire voice frequency connections.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Line-to-line.</E> The loss shall be set between 0 and 2 dB.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Direct digital interface.</E> On a direct digital interface, the loss through the office shall be adjusted to the proper level in the receive side.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Stability.</E> The long-term allowable variation in loss through the office shall be ±0.5 dB from the loss specified by the bidder.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Frequency response (loss relative to 1004 hz)</E> shall meet the following requirements.</P>

Paths with a 100 Hz impedance of 50 ohms or less shall be subjected to current surges, employing a 10 × 1000 microseconds waveshape as defined in Figure 4. For the purpose of determining this impedance, arresters which are mounted within the equipment are to be considered zero impedance. The crest current shall not exceed 500A; however, depending on the impedance of the test specimen this value of current may be lower. The crest current through the sample, multiplied by the sample's 100 Hz impedance, shall not exceed 1000 volts (V). Where sample impedance is less than two ohms, crest current shall be limited to 500A as shown in Figure 5.</P>

To assure coordination with the primary protection while reducing testing to the minimum, voltage surge tests should be conducted at a 1000 volts with primary arresters removed for devices protected by carbon blocks, or the + 3 sigma dc breakdown of other primary arresters. Surge waveshape should be 10 × 1000 microseconds.</P>

Arresters shall be removed for these tests, the peak surge voltage should be the + 3 sigma breakdown of the arrester in question on a voltage rising at 100V per microsecond and the time for the surge to decay to half voltage shall equal at least the delay time of the tube, as explained in Figure 7.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test Sample Preparation.</E> Prepare the sample by removing the inner and outer jacket, shield, and core wrap, if present, for a sufficient distance to allow one end to be accessed for test connections. Cut out a series of 2.5 millimeter by 13 millimeter (0.1 inch by 0.5 inch) rectangular slots along the test sample, at 300 millimeter (1 foot) intervals progressing successively 90 degrees around the circumference of the wire. Assure that the wire core is exposed at each slot by slitting the inner jacket and core wrap if present. Place the prepared sample in a dry vessel which when filled will maintain a one meter (3 foot) head of water over 6 meters (20 feet) of uncoiled wire. Extend and fasten the ends of the wire so they will be above the water line and the pairs are rigidly held for the duration of the test.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Capacitance and Conductance Testing.</E> Measure the initial values of mutual capacitance and conductance of all pairs in each wire at a frequency of 1 kilohertz before filling the vessel with water. Be sure the wire shield is grounded to the test equipment. Fill the vessel until there is a one meter (3 foot) head of water on the wires.</P>

Collect the water leakage from the end of the test sample during the test and weigh to the nearest 0.1 gram. Immediately after the one hour test, seal the ends of the wire with a thin layer of grease and remove all visible water from the closure, being careful not to remove water that penetrated into the core during the test. Reweigh the sample and determine the weight of water that penetrated into the core. The weight of water that penetrated into the core must not exceed 1 gram.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Option B.</E> Fill the closure with a 0.2 gram sodium fluorscein per liter water solution and apply a continuous pressure of 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Catch and weigh <PRTPAGE P="699"/>any water that leaks from the end of the wire during the one hour period. If no water leaks from the sample, carefully remove the water from the closure. Then carefully remove the outer jacket, shield, inner jacket and core wrap, if present, one at a time, examining with an ultraviolet light source for water penetration. After removal of the inner jacket and core wrap, if present, carefully dissect the core and examine for water penetration within the core. Where water penetration is observed, measure the penetration distance. The distance of water penetration into the core must not exceed 127 millimeters (5.0 inches).</P>

              <P>(III) <E T="03">Test Procedure.</E> (1) Using a suitable tool, expose enough of sheath slitting cord to permit grasping with needle nose pliers.</P>
              <P>(2) The prepared test specimens must be maintained at a temperature of 23 ±1 °C for at least 4 hours immediately prior to and during the test.</P>
              <P>(3) Wrap the sheath slitting cord around the plier jaws to ensure a good grip.</P>
              <P>(4) Grasp and hold the wire in a convenient position while gently and firmly pulling the sheath slitting cord longitudinally in the direction away from the wire end. The angle of pull may vary to any convenient and functional degree. A small starting notch is permissible.</P>
              <P>(5) The sheath slitting cord is considered acceptable if the cord can slit the jacket and/or shield for a continuous length of 0.6 meter (2 feet) without breaking the cord.</P>

            <P>(6) All conductors in any single length of cable shall be insulated with the same type of material.</P>
            <P>(7) A permissible overall performance level of faults in conductor insulation when using the test procedures in paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall average not greater than one fault per 12,000 conductor meters (40,000 conductor feet) for each gauge of conductor.</P>
            <P>(8) The test used to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be conducted as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Samples tested shall be taken from finished cables selected at random from standard production cable. The samples tested shall contain a minimum of 300 conductor meters (1,000 conductor feet) for cables sizes less than 50 pairs and 1,500 conductor meters (5,000 conductor feet) for cables sizes greater than or equal to 50 pairs. No further sample need be taken from the same cable production run within 6,000 cable meters (20,000 cable feet) of the original test sample from that run.</P>
            <P>(ii) The cable sample shall have its jacket, shield, and core wrap removed and its core shall be immersed in tap water for a minimum period of 6 hours. In lieu of removing the jacket, shield, and core wrap from the core, the entire cable may be tested. In this case, the core shall be completely filled with tap water, under pressure; then the cable assembly shall be immersed for a minimum period of 6 hours. With the cable core still fully immersed, except for end connections, the insulation resistance (IR) of all conductors to water shall be measured using a direct current (dc) voltage of 100 volts to 550 volts.</P>
            <P>(iii) An IR value of less than 500 megohms for any individual insulated conductor tested at or corrected to a temperature of 23 °C is considered a failure. If the cable sample is more than 7.5 meters (25 feet) long, all failing conductors shall be retested and reported in 7.5 meter (25 foot) segments.</P>
            <P>(iv) The pair count, gauge, footage, and number of insulation faults shall be recorded. This information shall be retained on a 6 month running basis for review by RUS when requested.</P>
            <P>(v) A fault rate, in a continuous length in any one reel, in excess of one fault per 3,000 conductor meters (10,000 conductor feet) due to manufacturing defects is cause for rejection. A minimum of 6,000 conductor meters (20,000 conductor feet) is required to develop a noncompliance in a reel.</P>
            <P>(9) Repairs to the conductor insulation during manufacturing are permissible. The method of repair shall be accepted by RUS prior to its use. The repaired insulation shall be capable of meeting the relevant electrical requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(10) All repaired sections of insulation shall be retested in the same manner as originally tested for compliance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section.</P>

              <P>(I) The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial designs and major modifications of accepted designs. Included in paragraph (V) of this appendix are suggested formats that may be used in submitting test results to RUS.</P>
              <P>(II) <E T="03">Sample Selection and Preparation.</E> (1) All testing shall be performed on lengths removed sequentially from the same 25 pair, 22 gauge jacketed cable. This cable shall not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 °C since its initial cool down after sheathing. The lengths specified are minimum lengths and if desirable from a laboratory testing standpoint longer lengths may be used.</P>
              <P>(a) Length A shall be 12 ±0.2 meters (40 ±0.5 feet) long. Prepare the test sample by removing the jacket, shield, and core wrap for a sufficient distance on both ends to allow the insulated conductors to be flared out. Remove sufficient conductor insulation so that appropriate electrical test connections can be made at both ends. Coil the sample with a diameter of 15 to 20 times its sheath diameter. Two lengths are required.</P>
              <P>(b) Length B shall be 300 millimeters (1 foot) long. Three lengths are required.</P>
              <P>(c) Length C shall be 3 meters (10 feet) long and shall be maintained at 23 ±3 °C for the duration of the test. Two lengths are required.</P>

              <P>(A) <E T="03">Capacitance.</E> The average mutual capacitance shall be within 10 percent of its original value;</P>
              <P>(B) The change in average mutual capacitance shall be less than 10 percent over the frequency range of 1 to 150 kilohertz; and</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Conductance.</E> The average mutual conductance shall not exceed 3.7 micromhos/kilometer (6 micromhos/mile) at a frequency of 1 kilohertz.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Insulation Compression Test</E>—(a) <E T="03">Test Sample B.</E> Remove jacket, shield, and core wrap being careful not to damage the conductor insulation. Remove one pair from the core and carefully separate and straighten the insulated conductors. Retwist the two <PRTPAGE P="714"/>insulated conductors together under sufficient tension to form 10 evenly spaced 360 degree twists in a length of 100 millimeters (4 inches).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sample Testing.</E> Center the mid 50 millimeters (2 inches) of the twisted pair between two smooth rigid parallel metal plates measuring 50 millimeters (2 inches) in length or diameter. Apply a 1.5 volt direct current potential between the conductors, using a light or buzzer to indicate electrical contact between the conductors. Apply a constant load of 67 newtons (15 pound-force) on the sample for one minute and monitor for evidence of contact between the conductors. Record results on suggested formats in paragraph (V) of this appendix or on other easily readable formats.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Temperature Cycling.</E> (a) Repeat paragraphs (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(ii) of this appendix for a separate set of samples A and B which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.</P>
              <P>(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, subject the test samples to 10 cycles of temperature between −40 °C and + 60 °C. The test samples shall be held at each temperature extreme for a minimum of 1.5 hours during each cycle of temperature.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Surge Test.</E> (a) One length of sample C shall be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of C shall be used to measure core to shield breakdown.</P>
              <P>(b) The samples shall be capable of withstanding, without damage, a single surge voltage of 20 kilovolts peak between conductors, and 35 kilovolts peak between conductors and the shield as hereinafter described. The surge voltage shall be developed from a capacitor discharge through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants shall be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microseconds wave shape.</P>
              <P>(c) The shape of the generated wave shall be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the cable sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample shall be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.</P>

              <P>(I) This test procedure described in this appendix is for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in sheath slitting cords.</P>
              <P>(II) <E T="03">Sample selection.</E> All testing shall be performed on two 1.2 m (4 ft) lengths of cable removed sequentially from the same 25 pair, 22 gauge jacketed cable. This cable shall not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 °C since its initial cool down after sheathing.</P>
              <P>(III) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> (1) Using a suitable tool, expose enough of the sheath slitting cord to permit grasping with needle nose pliers.</P>
              <P>(2) The prepared test specimens shall be maintained at a temperature of 23 ±1 °C for at least 4 hours immediately prior to and during the test.</P>
              <P>(3) Wrap the sheath slitting cord around the plier jaws to ensure a good grip.</P>
              <P>(4) Grasp and hold the cable in a convenient position while gently and firmly pulling the sheath slitting cord longitudinally in the direction away from the cable end. The angle of pull may vary to any convenient and functional degree. A small starting notch is permissible.</P>

              <P>(5) The sheath slitting cord is considered acceptable if the cord can slit the jacket and/<PRTPAGE P="716"/>or shield for a continuous length of 0.6 m (2 ft) without breaking the cord.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) This section covers the requirements for filled telephone cables intended for direct burial installation either by trenching or by direct plowing, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for aerial installation by attachment to a support strand.</P>
            <P>(i) The conductors are solid copper, individually insulated with an extruded cellular insulating compound which may be either totally expanded or expanded with a solid skin coating.</P>
            <P>(ii) The insulated conductors are twisted into pairs which are then stranded or oscillated to form a cylindrical core.</P>
            <P>(iii) For high frequency applications, the cable core may be separated into compartments with screening shields.</P>
            <P>(iv) A moisture resistant filling compound is applied to the stranded conductors completely covering the insulated conductors and filling the interstices between pairs and units.</P>
            <P>(v) The cable structure is completed by the application of suitable core wrapping material, a flooding compound, a shield or a shield/armor, and an overall plastic jacket.</P>
            <P>(2) The number of pairs and gauge size of conductors which are used within the RUS program are provided in the following table:</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test sample preparation.</E> Prepare the sample by removing the jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap for sufficient distance to allow one end to be accessed for test connections. Cut out a series of 6 millimeter (0.25 inch.) diameter holes along the test sample, at 30 centimeters (1 foot) intervals progressing successively 90 degrees around the circumference of the cable. Assure that the cable core is exposed at each hole by slitting the core wrapper.

              <P>(b) Test per Option A or Option B—(i) <E T="03">Option A.</E> Weigh the sample and closure prior to testing. Fill the closure with water and place under a continuous pressure of 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Collect the water leakage from the end of the test sample during the test and weigh to the nearest 0.1 gram. Immediately after the one hour test, seal the ends of the cable with a thin layer of grease and remove all visible water from the closure, being careful not to remove water that penetrated into the core during the test. Reweigh the sample and determine the weight of water that penetrated into the core. The weight of water that penetrated into the core must not exceed 6 grams.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Option B.</E> Fill the closure with a 0.2 gram sodium fluorscein per liter water solution and apply a continuous pressure 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Catch and weigh any water that leaks from the end of the cable during the one hour period. If no water leaks from the sample, carefully remove the water from the closure. Then carefully remove the jacket, shield or shield/ armor, and core wrap <PRTPAGE P="728"/>one at a time, examining with an ultraviolet light source for water penetration. After removal of the core wrap, carefully dissect the core and examine for water penetration within the core. Where water penetration is observed, measure the penetration distance. The distance of water penetration into the core must not exceed 127 millimeters (5.0 inches).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Insulation compression test</E>—(a) <E T="03">Test sample D.</E> Remove jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap being careful not to damage the conductor insulation.

              <P>(6) <E T="03">Humidity exposure.</E> (a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D, and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.</P>
              <P>(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, expose the test sample to 100 temperature cyclings. Relative humidity within the chamber must be maintained at 90 ±2 percent. One cycle consists of beginning at a stabilized chamber and test sample temperature of 52 ±1 °C, increasing the temperature to 57 ±1 °C, allowing the chamber and test samples to stabilize at this level, then dropping the temperature back to 52 ±1 °C.</P>
              <P>(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.</P>

              <P>(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, subject the test sample to the 10 cycles of temperature between a minimum of −40 °C and + 60 °C. The test sample must be held at each temperature extreme for a minimum of 1<FR>1/2</FR> hours during each cycle of temperature. The air within the temperature cycling chamber must be circulated throughout the duration of the cycling.</P>
              <P>(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(IV) <E T="03">Control sample</E>—(1) <E T="03">Test samples.</E> A separate set of lengths A, C, D, E, and F must have been maintained at 23 ±3 °C for at least 48 hours before the testing.</P>
              <P>(2) Repeat steps (III)(2) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix except use length A instead of length B.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Surge test.</E> (a) One length of sample F must be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of F must be used to measure the core to shield breakdown.</P>
              <P>(b) The samples must be capable of withstanding without damage, a single surge voltage of 15 kilovolts peak between conductors, and a 25 kilovolts peak surge voltage between conductors and the shield or shield/armor as hereinafter described. The surge voltage must be developed from a capacitor discharged through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants must be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microsecond wave shape.</P>
              <P>(c) The shape of the generated wave must be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the cable sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample will be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.</P>

For information on how to obtain Agency product acceptance, refer to the procedures listed at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm,</E> as well as additional information in RUS Bulletin 345-3, <E T="03">Acceptance of Standards, Specifications, Equipment Contract Forms, Manual Sections, Drawings, Materials and Equipment for the Telephone Program,</E> available for download at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/publications/bulletins.htm.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Agency</E> means the Rural Utilities Service, an Agency which delivers the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Utilities Programs.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Armor</E> means a metal tape installed under the outer jacket of the cable intended to provide mechanical protection during cable installation and environmental protection against rodents, termites, etc.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Attenuation</E> means the loss of power as the light travels in the fiber usually expressed in dB/km.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Bandwidth</E> means the range of signal frequencies that can be transmitted <PRTPAGE P="731"/>by a communications channel with defined maximum loss or distortion. Bandwidth indicates the information-carrying capacity of a channel.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Birefringence</E> means the decomposition of a pulse of light entering the fiber into “two polarized pulses” traveling at different velocities due to the different refractive indexes in the polarization axes in which the electric fields oscillate. Different refractive indexes in the fiber may be caused by an asymmetric fiber core, internal manufacturing stresses, or through external stresses from cabling and installation of the fiber optic cable, such as bending and twisting.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Cable cutoff wavelength</E> means the shortest wavelength at which only one mode light can be transmitted in any of the single mode fibers of an optical fiber cable.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Chromatic dispersion</E> means the broadening of a light pulse as it travels down the length of an optical fiber, resulting in different spectral components of the light pulse traveling at different speeds, due to the fact that the index of refraction of the fiber core is different for different wavelengths.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Cladding</E> means the outer layer of an optical fiber made of glass or other transparent material that is fused to the fiber core. The cladding concentrically surrounds the fiber core. It has a lower refractive index than the core, so light travelling in the fiber is maintained in the core by internal reflection at the core-cladding interface.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Core</E> means the central region of an optical waveguide or fiber which has a higher refractive index than the cladding through which light is transmitted.</P>

            <P>(12) <E T="03">Dielectric cable</E> means a cable which has neither metallic members nor other electrically conductive materials or elements.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Differential group delay</E> means the arrival time differential of the two polarized light components of a light pulse traveling through the optical fiber due to birefringence.</P>
            <P>(14) <E T="03">Graded Refractive Index Profile</E> means the refractive index profile of an optical fiber that varies smoothly with radius from the center of the fiber to the outer boundary of the cladding.</P>
            <P>(15) <E T="03">List of Acceptable Materials</E> means the latest edition of RUS Informational Publication 344-2, <E T="03">“List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Telecommunications Systems of RUS Borrowers.”</E> This document contains a convenient listing of products which have been determined to be acceptable by the Agency. The List of Acceptable Materials is available on the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/materials/lstomat.htm.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(16) <E T="03">Loose tube buffer</E> means the protective tube that loosely contains the optical fibers within the fiber optic cable, often filled with suitable water blocking material.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1755.902</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Minimum performance Specification for fiber optic cables.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section is intended for cable manufacturers, Agency borrowers, and consulting engineers. It covers the requirements for fiber optic cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried installations by trenching, direct plowing, and directional or pneumatic boring.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) Specification requirements are given in SI units which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.</P>
            <P>(ii) The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called “fibers,” herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several protective buffer tubes, in tight buffer tubes, or ribbon bundles with a protective core tube.</P>
            <P>(iii) Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core.</P>
            <P>(iv) The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material or water swellable elements to exclude water.</P>
            <P>(v) The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. A shield or armor or combination thereof may be included under the jacket. The jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some designs.</P>
            <P>(vi) Buried installation requires armor under the outer jacket.</P>
            <P>(vii) For self-supporting cable, the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core.</P>

            <P>(viii) Cables for mid-span applications for network access must be designed for easy mid-span access to the fibers. The manufacturer may use reversing oscillating stranding (SZ) described in section 6.4 of ITU-T Recommendation L.58, <E T="03">Construction, Installation and Protection of Cables and Other Elements of Outside Plant</E>, 2004 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)). The cable end user is cautioned that installed cable must be properly terminated. This includes properly securing rigid strength members (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, central strength member) and clamping the cable and jacket. It is important that cable components be secured to prevent movement of the cable or components over the operating conditions. Central strength member (CSM) clamps must prevent movement of the CSM; positive stop CSM clamps are recommended. The CSM must be routed as straight and as short as practical to prevent bowing or breaking of the CSM. The cable and jacket retention must be sufficient to prevent jacket slippage over the operating temperature range.</P>

            <P>(2) The normal temperature ranges for cables must meet paragraph 1.1.3 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640, <E T="03">Standard for Optical Fiber Outside Plant Communications Cable</E> (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).<PRTPAGE P="735"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Tensile rating.</E> The standard installation tensile rating for cables is 2670 N (600 1bf), unless installation involves micro type cables that utilize less stress related methods of installation, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, blown micro-fiber cable or All-Dielectric Self-Supporting (ADSS) cables (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">ADSS and other self-supporting cables.</E> Based on the storm loading districts referenced in Section 25, Loading of Grades B and C, of ANSI/IEEE C2-2007, <E T="03">National Electrical Safety Code</E>, 2007 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(b)) and the maximum span and location of cable installation provided by the end user, the manufacturer must provide a cable design with sag and tension tables showing the maximum span and sag information for that particular installation. The information included must be for Rule B, <E T="03">Ice and Wind Loading</E>, and when applicable, information on Rule 250C, <E T="03">Extreme Wind Loading.</E> Additionally, to ensure the proper ground clearance, typically a minimum of 4.7 m (15.5 feet), the end user should factor in the maximum sag under loaded conditions, as well as, height of attachment for each application.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Minimum bend diameter.</E> For cable under loaded and unloaded conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in paragraph 1.1.5, <E T="03">Minimum Bend Diameter</E>, of the ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). For very small cables, manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are independent of the outside diameter. For cables having a non-circular cross-section, the bend diameter is to be determined using the thickness of the cable associated with the preferential bending axis.</P>
            <P>(6) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, strippings, or markings provide fiber group identification.</P>
            <P>(7) Cables must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements of this section to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications.</P>

            <P>(8) Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed if accepted by the Agency. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain Agency product acceptance, refer to the procedures listed at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm</E>, as well as additional information in RUS Bulletin 345-3, <E T="03">Acceptance of Standards, Specifications, Equipment Contract Forms, Manual Sections, Drawings, Materials and Equipment for the Telephone Program</E> (hereinafter “RUS Bulletin 345-3”), available for download at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/publications/bulletins.htm.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(9) All cables sold to RUS telecommunications borrowers for projects involving RUS loan funds must be accepted by the Agency's Technical Standards Committee “A” (Telecommunications). Any design change to existing acceptable designs must be submitted to the Agency for acceptance. As stated in paragraph 8 above, refer to the procedures listed at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm</E> as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.</P>
            <P>(10) The Agency intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables meeting the requirements of this section have characteristics that will allow signals having a range of wavelengths to be carried simultaneously.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Optical fibers.</E> (1) The solid glass optical fibers must consist of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet-cured acrylate or other suitable coating. Each fiber must be continuous throughout its length.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Zero-dispersion.</E> Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 2, <E T="03">G.652.B attributes</E>, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.652 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)). However, when the end user stipulates a low water peak fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 4, <E T="03">G.652.D attributes</E>, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.652; or when the end user stipulates a low bending loss fiber, the optical fibers must meet the <PRTPAGE P="736"/>fiber attributes of Table 7-1, <E T="03">G.657 class A attributes</E>, found in the ITU-T Recommendation G.657 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-zero-dispersion.</E> Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 1, <E T="03">G.656 attributes</E>, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.656 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)). However, when the end user specifies Recommendation A, B, C, D, or E of ITU-T Recommendation G.655 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)), the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of ITU-T Recommendation G.655.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Multimode fibers.</E> Optical fibers must meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Matched cable.</E> Unless otherwise specified by the buyer, all single mode fiber cables delivered to a RUS-financed project must be manufactured to the same MFD specification. However, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the maximum MFD tolerance allowed for cable meeting the requirements of this section must be of a magnitude meeting the definition of “matched cable,” as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1755.900. With the use of cables meeting this definition the user can reasonably expect that the average bi-directional loss of a fusion splice to be ≤0.1 dB.</P>
            <P>(6) Buyers will normally specify the MFD for the fibers in the cable. When a buyer does not specify the MFD at 1310 nm, the fibers must be manufactured to an MFD of 9.2 µm with a maximum tolerance range of ±0.5 µm (362 ±20 microinch), unless the end user agrees to accept cable with fibers specified to a different MFD. When the end user does specify a MFD and tolerance conflicting with the MFD maximum tolerance allowed by paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (d)(5) must prevail.</P>
            <P>(7) Factory splices are not allowed.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Coating.</E> The optical fiber must be coated with a suitable material to preserve the intrinsic strength of the glass having an outside diameter of 250 ±15 micrometers (10 ±0.6 mils). Dimensions must be measured per the methods of paragraph 7.13 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). The protective coverings must be free from holes, splits, blisters, and other imperfections and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice. The diameter of the fiber, as the fiber is used in the cable, includes any coloring thickness or the uncolored coating, as the case may be. The strip force required to remove 30 ±3 millimeters (1.2 ±0.1 inch) of protective fiber coating must be between 1.0 N (0.2 pound-force) and 9.0 N (2 pound-force).</P>
            <P>(9) All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the same type, unless otherwise specified by end user.</P>
            <P>(10) Optical fiber dimensions and data reporting must be as required by paragraph 7.13.1.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Buffers.</E> (1) The optical fibers contained in a tube buffer (loose tube), an inner jacket (unit core), a channel, or otherwise loosely packaged must have a clearance between the fibers and the inside of the container sufficient to allow for thermal expansions of the tube buffer without constraining the fibers.

            <SECTNO>§ 1755.903</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fiber optic service entrance cables.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section covers Agency requirements for fiber optic service entrance cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried installations by trenching, direct plowing, directional or pneumatic boring. Cable meeting this section is recommended for fiber optic service entrances having 12 or fewer fibers with distances less than 100 meters (300 feet).</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) Specification requirements are given in SI units which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.</P>
            <P>(ii) The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called “fibers,” herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several protective buffer tubes, in tight buffer tubes, or ribbon bundles with a protective core tube.</P>
            <P>(iii) Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core.</P>
            <P>(iv) The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material or water swellable elements to exclude water.</P>
            <P>(v) The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. A shield or armor or combination thereof may be included under the jacket. This jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some designs.</P>
            <P>(vi) For rodent resistance or for additional protection with direct buried installations, it is recommended the use of armor under the outer jacket.</P>
            <P>(vii) For self-supporting cable the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core.</P>
            <P>(viii) For detection purposes, the cable may have toning elements embedded or extruded with the outer jacket.</P>

            <P>(2) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, striping, or markings provide fiber group identification.<PRTPAGE P="749"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Cables manufactured to the requirements of this section must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications.</P>

            <P>(4) Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain Agency's acceptance of such a modified design, refer to the product acceptance procedures available at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm</E> as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.</P>

            <P>(5) The cable must be designed for the temperatures ranges of Table 1-1, <E T="03">Cable Normal Temperature Ranges</E>, of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Tensile rating.</E> The cable must have ratings that are no less than the tensile ratings indicated in paragraph 1.1.4, <E T="03">Tensile Rating</E>, of Part 1 of the ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Self-supporting cables.</E> Based on the storm loading districts referenced in Section 25, Loading of Grades B and C, of ANSI/IEEE C2-2007 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(b)), and the maximum span and location of cable installation provided by the end user, the manufacturer must provide a cable design with sag and tension tables showing the maximum span and sag information for that particular installation. The information included must be for Rule B, <E T="03">Ice and Wind Loading</E>, and when applicable, information on Rule 250C, <E T="03">Extreme Wind Loading.</E> Additionally, to ensure the proper ground clearance, typically a minimum of 4.7 m (15.5 feet), the end user should factor in the maximum sag under loaded conditions as well as height of attachment for each application.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Minimum bend diameter.</E> For cable under loaded and unloaded conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in paragraph 1.1.5, <E T="03">Minimum Bend Diameter</E>, of Part 1 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). For very small cables, manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are independent of the outside diameter.</P>

            <P>(9) All cables sold to RUS Telecommunications borrowers must be accepted by the Agency's Technical Standards Committee “A” for projects involving RUS loan funds. All design changes to Agency acceptable designs must be submitted to the Agency for acceptance. Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed, if accepted by the Agency. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain the Agency's acceptance of cables, refer to the product acceptance procedures available at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm</E> as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.</P>
            <P>(10) The Agency intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables meeting the requirement of this section have characteristics that will allow signals, having a range of wavelengths, to be carried simultaneously.</P>
            <P>(11) The manufacturer is responsible to establish a quality assurance system meeting industry standards described in paragraph 1.8 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(12) The cable made must meet paragraph 1.10 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Optical fibers.</E> (1) The solid glass optical fibers must consist of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet-cured acrylate or other suitable coating. Each fiber must be continuous throughout its length.</P>

            <P>(2) Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 2, <E T="03">G.652.B attributes</E>, of ITU-T Recommendation G.652 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)), unless the end user specifically asks for another type of fiber. However, when the end user stipulates a low water peak fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 4, <E T="03">G.652.D attributes</E>, of ITU-T Recommendation G.652; or when the end user stipulates a low bending loss fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber <PRTPAGE P="750"/>attributes of Table 7-1, <E T="03">G.657 class A attributes</E>, of ITU-T Recommendation G.657 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)).</P>

            <P>(i) Additionally, optical ribbon fibers must meet paragraph 3.3, <E T="03">Optical Fiber Ribbons</E>, of Part 3 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Multimode fibers.</E> Optical fibers must meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Matched cable.</E> Unless otherwise specified by the buyer, all single mode fiber cables delivered to an Agency-financed project must be manufactured to the same MFD specification. However, notwithstanding the requirements indicated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the maximum MFD tolerance allowed for cables meeting the requirements of this section must be of a magnitude meeting the definition of “matched cable,” as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1755.900. With the use of cables meeting this definition the user can reasonably expect that the average bi-directional loss of a fusion splice to be ≤0.1 dB.</P>
            <P>(5) Buyers will normally specify the MFD for the fibers in the cable. When a buyer does not specify the MFD at 1310 nm, the fibers must be manufactured to an MFD of 9.2 µm with a maximum tolerance range of ±0.5 µm (362 ±20 microinch), unless the buyer agrees to accept cable with fibers specified to a different MFD. When the buyer does specify a MFD and tolerance conflicting with the MFD maximum tolerance allowed by paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) must prevail.</P>
            <P>(6) Factory splices are not allowed.</P>
            <P>(7) All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the same type unless otherwise specified by end user.</P>
            <P>(8) Optical fiber dimensions and data reporting must be as required by paragraph 7.13.1.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Buffers/coating.</E> (1) The optical fibers contained in a buffer tube (loose tube) loosely packaged must have a clearance between the fibers and the inside of the container sufficient to allow for thermal expansions without constraining the fibers. The protective container must be manufactured from a material having a coefficient of friction sufficiently low to allow the fibers free movement. The design may contain more than one tube. Loose buffer tubes must meet the requirements of Paragraph 3.2.1, <E T="03">Loose Buffer Tube Dimensions</E>, of Part 3 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(2) The loose tube coverings of each color and other fiber package types removed from the finished cable must meet the following shrinkback and cold bend performance requirements. The fibers may be left in the tube.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Shrinkback.</E> Testing must be conducted per ASTM D 4565 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(d)), paragraph 14.1, using a talc bed at a temperature of 95 °C. Shrinkback must not exceed 5 percent of the original 150 millimeter length of the specimen. The total shrinkage of the specimen must be measured.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cold bend.</E> Testing must be conducted on at least one tube from each color in the cable. Stabilize the specimen to −20 ±1 °C for a minimum of four hours. While holding the specimen and mandrel at the test temperature, wrap the tube in a tight helix ten times around a mandrel with a diameter the greater of five times the tube diameter or 50 mm. The tube must show no evidence of cracking when observed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</P>

            <P>(3) Optical fiber coating must meet the requirements of paragraph 2.4, <E T="03">Optical Fiber Coatings and Requirements</E>, of Part 2 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(i) All protective coverings in any single length of cable must be continuous and be of the same material except at splice locations.</P>
            <P>(ii) The protective coverings must be free from holes, splits, blisters, and other imperfections and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice.</P>
            <P>(iii) Repairs to the fiber coatings are not allowed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fiber and buffer tube identification.</E> Fibers within a unit and the units <PRTPAGE P="751"/>within a cable must be identified as indicated in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3 of Part 4 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)), respectively.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Strength members.</E> (1) Combined strength of all the strength members must be sufficient to support the stress of installation and to protect the cable in service. Strength members must meet paragraph 4.4, <E T="03">Strength Members</E>, of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). Self supporting aerial cables using the strength members as an integral part of the cable strength must comply with paragraph C.4, <E T="03">Static Tensile Testing of Aerial Self-Supporting Cables</E>, of ANNEX C of ICEA S-110-717.</P>
            <P>(2) Strength members may be incorporated into the core as a central support member or filler, as fillers between the fiber packages, as an annular serving over the core, as an annular serving over the intermediate jacket, embedded in the outer jacket or as a combination of any of these methods.</P>
            <P>(3) The central support member or filler must contain no more than one splice per kilometer of cable. Individual fillers placed between the fiber packages and placed as annular servings over the core must contain no more than one splice per kilometer of cable. Cable sections having central member or filler splices must meet the same physical requirements as un-spliced cable sections.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding what has been indicated in other parts of this document, in each length of completed cable having a metallic central member, the dielectric strength between the optional armor and the metallic center member must withstand at least 15 kilovolts direct current for 3 seconds.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Forming the cable core.</E> (1) Protected fibers must be assembled with the optional central support member and strength members in such a way as to form a cylindrical group or other acceptable core constructions and must meet Section 4.5, Assembly of Cables, of Part 4 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at 1755.901(c)). Other acceptable cable cores include round, figure 8, flat or oval designs.</P>
            <P>(2) The standard cylindrical group or core designs must consist of 12 fibers or less.</P>
            <P>(3) When threads or tapes are used as core binders, they must be colored either white or natural and must be a non-hygroscopic and non-wicking dielectric material. Water swell-able threads and tapes are permitted.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Filling/flooding compounds and water blocking elements.</E> (1) To prevent the ingress and migration of water through the cable and core, filling/flooding compounds or water blocking elements must be used.</P>
            <P>(i) Filling compounds must be applied into the interior of the loose fiber tubes and into the interstices of the core. When a core wrap is used, the filling compound must also be applied to the core wrap, over the core wrap and between the core wrap and inner jacket when required.</P>

            <P>(ii) Flooding compounds must be sufficiently applied between the optional inner jacket and armor and between the armor and outer jacket so that voids and air spaces in these areas are minimized. The use of floodant between the armor and outer jacket is not required when uniform bonding, per paragraph l(9) of this section, is achieved between the plastic-clad armor and the outer jacket. Floodant must exhibit adhesive properties sufficient to prevent jacket slip when tested per the requirements of paragraphs 7.26 through 7.26.2 of Part 7, <E T="03">Testing, Test Methods, and Requirements</E>, of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(iii) Water blocking elements must achieve equal or better performance in preventing the ingress and migration of water as compared to filling and flooding compounds. In lieu of a flooding compound, water blocking elements may be applied between the optional inner jacket and armor and between the armor and outer jacket to prevent water migration. The use of the water blocking elements between the armor and outer jacket is not required when uniform bonding, per paragraph (l)(10) of this section, is achieved between the plastic-clad armor and the outer jacket.</P>

            <P>(2) The materials must be homogeneous and uniformly mixed; free <PRTPAGE P="752"/>from dirt, metallic particles and other foreign matter; easily removed; nontoxic and present no dermal hazards.</P>
            <P>(3) The individual cable manufacturer must satisfy the Agency that the filling compound or water blocking elements selected for use is suitable for its intended application.</P>

            <P>(i) Filling/Flooding compound materials must be compatible with the cable components when tested per paragraph 7.16, <E T="03">Material Compatibility and Cable Aging Test</E>, of Part 7 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>

            <P>(ii) Water blocking elements must be compatible with the cable components when tested per paragraph 7.16, <E T="03">Material Compatibility and Cable Aging Test</E>, of Part 7 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Core wrap (optional).</E> (1) At the option of the manufacturer, one or more layers of non-hygroscopic and non-wicking dielectric material may be applied with an overlap over the core.</P>
            <P>(2) The core wrap(s) can be used to provide a heat barrier to prevent deformation or adhesion between the fiber tubes or can be used to contain the core.</P>
            <P>(3) When core wraps are used, sufficient filling compound must be applied to the core wraps so that voids or air spaces existing between the core wraps and between the core and the inner side of the core wrap are minimized.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Inner jacket (optional).</E> (1) Inner jackets may be applied directly over the core or over the strength members. Inner jackets are optional.</P>
            <P>(2) The inner jacket material and test requirements must be the same as for the outer jacket material per paragraph (n) of this section, except that either black or natural polyethylene may be used. In the case of natural polyethylene, the requirements for absorption coefficient and the inclusion of furnace black are waived.</P>

            <P>(v) <E T="03">Cable conductor pull-out resistance.</E> Test modules that have received no prior conditioning shall be equipped with 100 26, 24, and 22 AWG 38 cm (15 in.) cable conductors using the insertion tool recommended by the cross-connect module manufacturer. With the test samples suitably supported, conductors from each sample shall be pulled, one at a time, by a tensile machine at a cross-head speed of 6 cm/min (2.4 in./min). Wires shall be pulled both perpendicular and parallel to the plane of the face of the splice module and shall withstand a load of at least 1.1 kg (2.5 lb) before pulling out.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Electrical requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Dielectric strength.</E> A housing fully equipped with cross-connect modules shall be tested for dielectric strength in accordance with (g)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) The dielectric strength of a contact within the cross-connect module to contacts on either side shall be tested. The module shall be tested in a dry environment with an ac power source capable of supplying 8 kv at a rate of increase of 500 volts per second, a circuit breaker to open at breakdown, and a voltmeter to record the breakdown potential. Cross-connect modules shall be prepared in accordance with industry accepted splicing techniques with leads trimmed to approximately 38 cm (15 in.). The dielectric strength of each contact to the contacts on either side shall have an average dielectric strength of approximately 5.0 kv.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Operational requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Durability.</E> In order to verify the durability requirements while minimizing the number of test housings required to complete the test program, the contacts selected for tests shall be separately identified and then checked to establish compliance after the various tests have been conducted.</P>

            <P>(ii) Twenty-five jumper connections shall be made on each of two contacts chosen at random from a representative sample in an assembled interface unit. After this test, these and surrounding contacts shall be inspected for damage such as cracks or chips in metal or plastic parts. Failure consists of structural damage, open circuits <PRTPAGE P="791"/>through the connector, or inability to pass the jumper wire pullout tests described in paragraph (i)(3)(iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) Select six contacts at random in a representative interface. On each of these contacts attach any test cord included with the unit as specified under normal use of that cord and then remove the test cord as follows. On sample 1, remove the cord normally ten times. On sample 2, remove the clip ten times by jerking the test leads straight out. In these and the remaining tests, do this without releasing any manual attachment mechanisms. On sample 3, remove ten times by jerking downward at 45 °from horizontal; sample 4, upward 45 °ten times; sample 5, left 45 °ten times; sample 6, right 45 °ten times. Check for opens and damage in the test cord, clips, and cross-connect modules. Failure consists of structural damage, open circuits through the connector, or inability of module to pass the test connector reliability, jumper wire pullout, and dielectric strength tests described in paragraphs (i)(3)(ii), (i)(3)(iv), and (i)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Packaging and identification requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Product identification.</E> (i) Each housing, terminal block, or cross-connect module shall be permanently marked with the manufacturer's name or trade mark.</P>
            <P>(ii) The date of manufacture, model number, serial number and RUS assigned designations shall be placed on a decal inside housings. The product identification nomenclature must correspond with the nomenclature used in the manufacturer's quality assurance program.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Packaging requirements.</E> (i) Buried plant housings shall be packaged securely in an environmentally safe container to prevent either deterioration or physical damage to the unit during shipment, handling and storage.</P>
            <P>(ii) The product with all the necessary parts shall be shipped in one container unless significant advantages to the user can be obtained otherwise. Packaging of parts in the carton shall be such that the parts become available in the order in which they are needed. The package should be clearly marked as to which end to open. Packages shall be clearly labeled, and correspond to the names given in the instructions.</P>
            <P>(iii) Products packed in shipping containers shall be cushioned, blocked, braced, and anchored to prevent movement and damage.</P>
            <P>(iv) All products shall be secured to pallets with non-metallic strapping. The strapping and the manner employed shall be of sufficient quantity, width, and thickness to preclude failure during transit and handling.</P>
            <P>(v) The use of shrink or stretch film to secure the load to the pallet is permitted. However, such film must be applied over the required strapping.</P>
            <P>(vi) Containers that are too large or heavy to be palletized, such as crates, shall be shipped in their own containers. When practical, these containers shall be provided with skids to facilitate fork-lift handling.</P>
            <P>(vii) When packaged, the outer cartons shall meet the requirements of the Uniform Freight Classification and the National Motor Freight Classification.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Container marking requirements.</E> (i) The package shall be readily identifiable as to the manufacturer, model number, date of manufacture, and serial number.</P>
            <P>(ii) The RUS assigned housing designation shall be stamped or marked on the outside of the package container with letter and number sizes large enough for easy identification.</P>
            <P>(iii) Each package shall be marked with its approximate gross weight.</P>
            <P>(iv) All containers carrying delicate or fragile items shall be marked to clearly identify this condition.</P>
