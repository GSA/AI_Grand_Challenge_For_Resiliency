      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart contains the rules that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its components follow in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records maintained by the USDA. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 7 CFR Subpart G are also processed under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) The terms “component” or “components” are used throughout this subpart and in appendix A of this subpart to include both USDA program agencies and staff offices.</P>
            <P>(c) Unless otherwise stated, references to number of days indicates business days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.</P>
            <P>(d) Supplemental regulations for FOIA requests and appeals relating to records of USDA's Office of Inspector General are set forth in 7 CFR part 2620.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Public reading rooms.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Components within the USDA maintain public reading rooms containing the records that the FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection in an electronic format. Each component is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each component shall ensure that its reading room and indices are reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.</P>

            <P>(b) A link to USDA Electronic Reading Rooms can be found on the USDA public FOIA website.<PRTPAGE P="9"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), each component within the Department shall make the following materials available for public inspection and copying (unless they are promptly published and copies offered for sale):</P>
            <P>(1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;</P>

            <P>(2) Those statements of policy and interpretation which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
            <P>(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</P>
            <P>(4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to a person pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), and have been requested three or more times; and</P>
            <P>(5) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to a person pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), and which because of the nature of their subject matter, have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records. Components shall decide on a case by case basis whether records meet these requirements, based on the following factors:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making a records request.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Where and how to submit a request.</E> (1) A requester may submit a request in writing and address the request to the designated component within the USDA that maintains the records requested. The Departmental FOIA Officer will maintain a list of contact information for component FOIA offices and make this list available on the USDA public FOIA website. Filing a FOIA request directly with the component that maintains the records will facilitate the processing of the request. If responsive records are likely to reside within more than one USDA component, the requester should submit the request to the USDA Departmental FOIA office.</P>
            <P>(2) Alternatively, a requester may submit a request electronically via USDA's online web portal or via the National FOIA portal. USDA components also accept requests submitted to the email addresses of component FOIA offices as listed on the USDA public FOIA website.</P>
            <P>(3) If a requester cannot determine where within the USDA to send a request, he or she should consult the USDA public FOIA website to determine where the records might be maintained. Alternatively, he or she may send the request to the Departmental FOIA Officer, who will route the request to the component(s) believed most likely to maintain the records requested.</P>
            <P>(4) To facilitate the processing of a request, a requester should place the phrase “FOIA REQUEST” in capital letters on the front of their envelope, the cover sheet of their facsimile transmittal, or the subject line of their email.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">What to include in a request.</E> (1) A requester seeking access to USDA records should provide sufficient information about himself or herself to enable components to resolve, in a timely manner, any issues that might arise as to the subject and scope of the request, and to deliver the response and, if appropriate, any records released in response to the request. Generally, this includes the name of the requester, name of the institution on whose behalf the request is being made, a phone number at which the requester might be contacted, an email address and/or postal mailing address, and a statement indicating willingness to pay any applicable processing fees.</P>

            <P>(2) A requester seeking access to USDA records must also provide a reasonable description of the records requested, as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="10"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself may receive greater access if the request is accompanied by a signed declaration of identity that is either notarized or includes a penalty of perjury statement pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746.</P>
            <P>(4) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased. As an exercise of administrative discretion, the component can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary, in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">How to describe the requested records.</E> (1) A FOIA request must reasonably describe the requested records. This means a request must be described in such a way as to enable component personnel familiar with the subject of the request to locate them with reasonable effort. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or types of records that they are seeking. To the extent possible, supply specific information regarding dates, titles, names of individuals, names of offices, locations, names of agencies or other organizations, and contract or grant numbers that may help in identifying the records requested. If the request relates to pending litigation, the requester should identify the court and its location in addition to a case number.</P>
            <P>(2) If a component determines that a request is incomplete, or that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component will inform the requester of this fact and advise as to what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requirements for responding to records requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except for the instances described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the component that first receives a request for a record is responsible for responding to or referring the request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The head of a component or his or her designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records originating with or maintained by that component.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Handling of misdirected requests.</E> When a component's FOIA office receives and determines that a request was misdirected within the Department's components or should be directed to additional Department component(s), the receiving component's FOIA office will route the request to the FOIA office of the proper component(s).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordination of requests involving multiple components.</E> When a component becomes aware that a requester has sent a request for records to multiple USDA components, the component will notify the Departmental FOIA Officer to determine if some form of coordination is warranted.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals in the process of records review.</E> (1) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originated with the component processing the request but contain within them information of interest to another USDA component or other Federal Government office, the component processing the request should consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Referral.</E> When the component processing the request believes that another USDA component or Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that USDA component or Federal Government office. Ordinarily, the component or agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component processing the request and the originating component or agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement component or agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement component or agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component or agency locates within its file's material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component that received the request should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the component that originally received the request.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to records requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Components should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet by electronic means, such as email, in lieu of first-class U.S. mail.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgements of requests.</E> On receipt of a request, the processing component will send an acknowledgement to the requester and provide an assigned request tracking number for further reference. Components should include in the acknowledgement a brief description of the records sought, or attach a copy of the request, to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> When a component makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The component will also inform the requester of any fees charged, pursuant to § 1.12, in the processing of the request. Except in instances where advance payment of fees is required, components may issue bills for fees charged at the same time that they issue a determination. The component will include a statement advising the requester that he or she has the right to seek dispute resolution services from the component's FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Specifying the format of records.</E> Generally, requesters may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. Components will accommodate the request if the records are readily reproducible in that form or format.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemptions and discretionary release.</E> All component records, except those specifically exempted from mandatory disclosure by one or more provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and (b), will be made available to any person submitting a records request under this subpart. Components are authorized, in their sole discretion, to make discretionary releases of their records when such releases are not otherwise specifically prohibited by Executive Order, statute, or regulation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Reasonable segregation of records.</E> If a requested record contains portions that are exempt from mandatory disclosure and other portions that are not exempt, the processing component will ensure that all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions are disclosed, and that all exempt portions are identified according to the specific exemption(s) that are applicable.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests.</E> A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect will notify the requester of that determination in writing. The written communication to the requester will include the name and title of the person responsible for the adverse determination, if other than the official signing the letter; a brief statement of the reason(s) for the determination, including any exemption(s) applied in denying the request; an estimate of the <PRTPAGE P="12"/>volume of records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation; a statement that the determination may be appealed, followed by a description of the requirements to file an appeal; and a statement advising the requester that he or she has the right to seek dispute resolution services from the component's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services (“OGIS”). An adverse determination includes:</P>
            <P>(1) A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part;</P>
            <P>(2) A determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be found, when no responsive records are located and released;</P>
            <P>(3) A determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the format sought by the requester;</P>
            <P>(4) A determination on any disputed fee matter; or</P>
            <P>(5) A denial of a request for expedited treatment.</P>
            <P>(h) Upon request, the component will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the component may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to perfected records requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Components ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed pursuant to § 1.4(c), the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the proper component's office that is designated to receive requests, but in any event not later than 10-working days after the request is first received by any component's office that is designated to receive requests.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response time for responding to requests.</E> Components ordinarily will inform requesters of their determination concerning requests within 20 working days of the date of receipt of the requests, plus any extension authorized by paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Multitrack processing and how it affects requests.</E> All components must designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. A component also may designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors a component may consider are the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. Upon request, components will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track in order to decrease the processing time.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Circumstances for extending the response time.</E> Whenever the component cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limit on that basis, the component must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the component estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component must, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The component must make available its designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The component also must alert requesters to the availability of the OGIS to provide dispute resolution services.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures for requesting expedited processing.</E> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>

            <P>(1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it <PRTPAGE P="13"/>is determined by the component that they involve:</P>
            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
            <P>(2) Requests for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested. Components receiving requests for expedited processing will decide whether to grant them within 10 calendar days of their receipt of these requests and will notify the requesters accordingly. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request or appeal will be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests or appeals, and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Records responsive to records requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that the component begins its search.</P>
            <P>(b) A component is not required to create a new record in order to fulfill a request for records. The FOIA does not require agencies to do research, to analyze data, or to answer written questions in response to a request.</P>
            <P>(c) Creation of records may be undertaken voluntarily.</P>
            <P>(d) A component will provide a record in the format specified by a requester, if the record is readily reproducible by the component in the format requested.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for processing records requests seeking business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Each component is responsible for making the final determination with regard to the disclosure or nondisclosure of business information in records submitted by an outside entity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the USDA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, or Tribe, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly, to the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good-faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When notice to the submitter is required.</E> (1) The component must promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if the component determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:</P>
            <P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The component has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.</P>

            <P>(2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the component may post or publish a notice in a place or manner <PRTPAGE P="14"/>reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The component determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA and therefore will not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12,600.</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, the component must give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Submitter's opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> (1) The component must specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If a submitter objects to disclosure of any portion of the records, the submitter must provide the component with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information. The submitter must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.</P>
            <P>(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The component is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose over submitter's objection.</E> If a component decides to disclose confidential commercial information over the objection of a submitter, the component will give the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the component intends to release them; and</P>
            <P>(3) A disclosure date subsequent to the notice.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Corresponding notice to requester.</E> The component must notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeals of adverse determinations.</E> If a requester is dissatisfied with a component's response to his or her request, the requester may submit a written appeal of that component's adverse determination denying the request in any respect.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Deadline for submitting an appeal.</E> Requesters must make the appeal in writing. To be considered timely, the appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions transmitted, within 90 calendar days of the date of the adverse determination. Components adjudicating appeals will issue a decision on an appeal, within 20-working days of its date of receipt, plus any extension authorized by § 1.6(d).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals officials.</E> Each component will provide for review of appeals by an official different from the official who made the initial determination(s).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Components' responses to appeals.</E> The decision on an appeal will be made in writing.</P>

            <P>(1) If the component grants the appeal in part or in whole, it will inform <PRTPAGE P="15"/>the requester of any conditions surrounding the granting of the request <E T="03">(e.g.,</E> payment of fees). If the component grants only a portion of the appeal, it will treat the portion not granted as a denial.</P>
            <P>(2) If the component denies the appeal, either in part or in whole, it will inform the requester of that decision and of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The reasons for denial, including any FOIA exemptions asserted;</P>
            <P>(ii) The name and title or position of each official responsible for denial of the appeal;</P>
            <P>(iii) The availability of mediation services offered by the OGIS of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The right to judicial review of the denial in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Legal sufficiency review of an appeal.</E> If a component makes the determination to deny an appeal in part or whole, that component will send a copy of all records to the Assistant General Counsel, General Law and Research Division, that the Office of the General Counsel (“OGC”) would need to examine to provide a legal sufficiency review of the component's decision.</P>
            <P>(1) Frequently, these records will include a copy of the unredacted records requested, a copy of the records marked to indicate information the component proposes to withhold, all correspondence relating to the request, and a proposed determination letter. When the volume of records is so large as to make sending a copy impracticable, the component will enclose an informative summary and representative sample of those records. The component will not deny an appeal until it receives concurrence from the Assistant General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(2) With regard to appeals involving records of OIG, the records in question will be referred to the OIG Office of Counsel, which will coordinate all necessary reviews.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Submission of an appeal before judicial review.</E> Before seeking review by a court of a component's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authentication under Departmental Seal and certification of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Requests seeking either authenticated or certified copies of records will generally be processed under the FOIA. FOIA search, review, and duplication fees, where applicable, may also apply. However, because the costs for authenticated and certified copies are outside of the FOIA, the provisions of § 1.12 that call for the automatic waiver of FOIA fees under $25.00 do not apply.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authentication of records.</E> (1) Authentication provides confirmation by a USDA officer that a certified copy of a record is what it purports to be, an accurate duplicate of the original record.</P>

            <P>(2) When a request is received for an authenticated copy of a record that the component determines may be made available, under the FOIA, each component will send an authentic (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> correct) copy of the record to the Assistant General Counsel in the OGC Division responsible for the applicable component program or other designee of the Secretary of Agriculture. The Assistant General Counsel for the applicable component program or other designee of the Secretary of Agriculture will confirm the authenticity of the record and affix the seal of the USDA to it.</P>
            <P>(3) The Hearing Clerk in the Office of Administrative Law Judges may authenticate copies of records for the Hearing Clerk. The Director of the National Appeals Division may authenticate copies of records for the National Appeals Division. The Inspector General is the official who authenticates copies of records for OIG.</P>

            <P>(4) When any component determines that a record for which authentication is requested may be made available only in part, because certain portions of it are exempt from release under the FOIA, the component will process the record under the FOIA and make any needed redactions, including notations on the record as to the FOIA exemption(s) which require(s) the removal of the information redacted. In such an instance, the component will supply a copy of the record both in its unredacted state and in its redacted <PRTPAGE P="16"/>state to the party authorized to perform authentication, along with a copy of the proposed determination letter regarding the withholding of the information redacted.</P>
            <P>(5) The cost for authentication of records is $10.00 each.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification of records.</E> (1) Certification is the procedure by which a USDA official confirms that a copy of a record is a true reproduction of the original.</P>
            <P>(2) When a request is received for a certified copy of a record that the component determines may be made available under the FOIA, each component will prepare a correct copy and a statement attesting that the copy is a true and correct copy.</P>
            <P>(3) When any component determines that a record for which a certified copy is requested may be made available only in part, because certain portions of it are exempt from release under the FOIA, the component will process the record under the FOIA and make any needed redactions, including notations on the record as to the FOIA exemption(s) which require(s) the removal of the information redacted.</P>
            <P>(4) The cost for certification of records is $5.00 each.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preservation of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Components will preserve all correspondence and records relating to requests and appeals received under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction of such correspondence and records is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the NARA. Agency records will not be disposed of, or destroyed, while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.12</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fees and fee schedule.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authorization to set FOIA fees.</E> The Chief Financial Officer is delegated authority to promulgate regulations providing for a uniform fee schedule applicable to all components of the USDA regarding requests for records under this subpart. The regulations providing for a uniform fee schedule are found in appendix A of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">In general.</E> Components will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of appendix A of this subpart and the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Fee Guidelines”).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Guidance for lowering FOIA fees.</E> Components will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner practicable.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Communicating with requesters on fee issues.</E> In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this subpart, a component may contact a requester for additional information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notifying requesters of estimated fees.</E> When a component determines or estimates that the processing of a FOIA request will incur chargeable FOIA fees, in accordance with appendix A of this subpart and the OMB Fee Guidelines, the component will notify the requester in writing of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Requester commitment to pay estimated fees.</E> In cases in which a requester has been notified that the processing of his or her request will incur chargeable FOIA fees, the component providing such notification will not begin processing the request until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates the amount of fees that he or she is willing to pay, or in the case of a requester who has not yet been provided with his or her statutory entitlements, designates that he or she seeks only that which can be provided by these statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount he or she is willing to pay.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Tolling of request for fee issues.</E> If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component will toll the processing <PRTPAGE P="17"/>of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester is willing to pay. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Assisting requesters wishing to lower fees.</E> Components will make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Timing of Bills for Collection.</E> Except in instances where advance payment is required, or where requesters have previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the billing date, components may issue Bills for Collection for FOIA fees owed at the same time that they issue their responses to FOIA requests.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Advance payment of FOIA fees when estimated fees exceed $250.00.</E> When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged for the processing of a FOIA request is likely to exceed $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. However, a component may elect to process a request prior to collecting fees exceeding $250.00 when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Special services.</E> For services not covered by the FOIA or by appendix A of this subpart, as described in § 1.10, components may set their own fees in accordance with applicable law. Although components are not required to provide special services, such as providing multiple copies of the same record, or sending records by means other than first class mail, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of these services will be charged.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> When a component reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, components will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involves. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated for fee purposes.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Payment of FOIA fees.</E> Requesters must pay FOIA fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Failure to pay properly charged fees.</E> When a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the component begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a request, as provided in § 1.6(b), and if unusual circumstances, as that term is defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in § 1.6(d), it may not charge search fees for the processing of the request, or duplication fees for the processing of the request if the requester is classified as an educational institution requester, a noncommercial scientific institution requester, or a representative of the news media, as defined in appendix A of this subpart, unless:<PRTPAGE P="18"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The component notifies the requester, in writing, within the statutory 20-working day time period, that unusual circumstances, as that term is defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request;</P>
            <P>(ii) More than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The component has discussed with the requester by means of written mail, electronic mail, or by telephone (or has made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.</P>
            <P>(2) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(p) <E T="03">Waivers of chargeable fees.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below that established in Table 1 of appendix A of this subpart, where a component determines, based on available evidence, that the requester has demonstrated that:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as defined in paragraph (p)(3) of this section, because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and;</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester as defined in paragraph (p)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjudication of fee waivers.</E> Each fee waiver request is judged on its own merit.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Factors for consideration of public interest.</E> In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, components will consider all four of the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
            <P>(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the requester's individual understanding. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news media, as defined in appendix A of this subpart, will satisfy this consideration.</P>
            <P>(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant degree. However, components will not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Factors for consideration of commercial interest.</E> In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the requester's commercial interest, components will consider the following two factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Components will identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in appendix A of this subpart. Requesters may be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
            <P>(ii) A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. Components ordinarily will presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Partial fee waivers.</E> Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of <PRTPAGE P="19"/>fees, a waiver will be granted for those records only.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Timing of requests for fee waivers.</E> Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced in paragraph (p)(3) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request later so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P>

            <EAR>App. A, Subpt. A, Pt. 1</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1—Fee Schedule</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 1. In General.</E> This schedule sets forth fees to be charged for providing copies of records—including photographic reproductions, microfilm, maps and mosaics, and related services—requested under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). The fees set forth in this schedule are applicable to all components of the USDA. Further information about fees and fee waivers is provided in 7 CFR 1.12 Fees and Fee Waivers.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 2. Definitions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Types of FOIA fees.</E> The FOIA defines the following types of FOIA fees that may be charged for responding to FOIA requests.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search fees.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Searching</E> is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.</P>

            <P>(ii) Search time is charged in quarter-hour increments within the USDA, and includes the <E T="03">direct costs</E> incurred by a component in searching for records responsive to a request. It does not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are maintained.</P>
            <P>(iii) Components may charge for time spent searching for requested records even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records that they locate are entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(iv) USDA components will charge for search time at the actual salary rate of the individual who conducts the search, plus 16 percent of the salary rate (to cover benefits). This rate was adopted for consistency with the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines (“OMB Fee Guidelines”) that state that agencies should charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs that they incur in searching for responsive records.</P>
            <P>(v) Search time also includes the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Components will notify requesters of the costs of creating such a program, and requesters must agree to pay the associated costs before these costs may be incurred.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review fees.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Reviewing</E> is the process of examining records located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of the records is exempt from disclosure. The process of review also includes the process of preparing records for disclosure, for example, doing all that is necessary to redact them and prepare them for release. Review time also includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure of responsive records made by a business submitter as discussed in 7 CFR 1.8 Requirements for processing requests seeking business information. However, it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of the nine FOIA exemptions.</P>

            <P>(ii) Review time is charged in quarter-hour increments within the USDA, and includes the <E T="03">direct costs</E> incurred by a component in preparing records responsive to a request for disclosure. It does not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are maintained.</P>
            <P>(iii) USDA components may charge for time spent reviewing requested records even if they determine that the records reviewed are entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(iv) USDA components will charge for review time at the actual salary rate of the individual who conducts the review, plus 16 percent of the salary rate (to cover benefits). This rate was adopted for consistency with the OMB Fee Guidelines that state that agencies should charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs that they incur in reviewing records for disclosure.</P>
            <P>(v) Review time also includes the direct costs associated with the cost of computer programming designed to facilitate a manual review of the records, or to perform electronic redaction of responsive records, particularly when records are maintained in electronic form. Components will notify requesters of the costs performing such programming, and requesters must agree to pay the associated costs before these costs may be incurred.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication fees.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duplicating</E> is the process of producing copies of records or information contained in records requested under the FOIA. Copies <PRTPAGE P="20"/>can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among other forms.</P>

            <P>(ii) Duplication is generally charged on a per-unit basis. The duplication of paper records will be charged at a rate of $.05 per page within the USDA. The duplication of records maintained in other formats will include all <E T="03">direct costs</E> incurred by a component in performing the duplication, including any costs associated in acquiring special media, such as CDs, disk drives, special mailers, and so forth, for transmitting the requested records or information. It does not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are maintained.</P>
            <P>(iii) Duplication generally does not include the cost of the time of the individual making the copy. This time is generally factored into the per page cost of duplication. However, when duplication requires the handling of fragile records, or paper records that cannot be safely duplicated in high-speed copiers, components may also charge for the time spent duplicating these records. In such an instance, the cost of this time will be added to the per-page charge, and an explanation provided to the requester in the component's itemization of FOIA fees charges. Components may describe this time as time spent in duplicating fragile records.</P>
            <P>(iv) USDA components will charge for time spent in duplicating fragile records at the actual salary rate of the individual who performs the duplication, plus 16 percent of the salary rate (to cover benefits). This rate was adopted for consistency with the OMB Fee Guidelines that state that agencies should charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs that they incur in duplicating requested records.</P>
            <P>(v) Where paper records must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, duplication costs will also include the direct costs associated with scanning those materials, including the time spent by the individual performing the scanning. Components may describe this time as time spent in scanning paper records.</P>
            <P>(vi) However, when components ordinarily scan paper records in order to review and/or redact them, the time required for scanning records will not be included in duplication fees, but in review fees, when these are applicable. When components that ordinarily scan paper records in order to review and/or redact them release records in an electronic format to requesters who are not to be charged review fees, duplication fees will not include the time spent in scanning paper records. In such instances, duplication fees may only include the direct costs of reproducing the scanned records. In such instances, components may not charge duplication fees on a per-page basis.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Categories of FOIA requesters for fee purposes.</E> The FOIA defines the following types of requests and requesters for the charging of FOIA fees.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requests.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requests</E> are requests for information for a use or a purpose that furthers commercial, trade or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. Components will determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because a component has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the component may provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification. A component's decision to place a request in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.</P>
            <P>(ii) Commercial requests will be charged applicable search fees, review, and duplication fees.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a commercial request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), it may not charge search fees for the processing of the request. It may, however, still charge applicable review and duplication fees.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a commercial request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), when unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), and the component notifies the requester, in writing, within the statutory 20-working day time period, that unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, and the component has discussed with the requester by means of written mail, electronic mail, or by telephone (or has made not less than three good faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request, the component may charge any search fees for the processing of the request, as well as any applicable review and duplication fees. Otherwise, it may only charge applicable review and duplication fees.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational institution requesters.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Educational institution requesters</E> are requesters who are affiliated with a school <PRTPAGE P="21"/>that operates a program of scholarly research, such as a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research. Records sought by students at an educational institution for use in fulfilling their degree requirements may qualify if the requester articulates a clear relationship to his or her coursework. Students must document how the records they are requesting will further the scholarly research aims of the institution in question.</P>
            <P>(ii) Educational institution requesters are entitled to receive 100 pages of duplication without charge. Following the exhaustion of this entitlement, they will be charged fees for the duplicating of any additional pages of responsive records released. They may not be charged search or review fees.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to an educational use request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), it may not charge duplication fees for the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to an educational use request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), when unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), and the component notifies the requester, in writing, within the statutory 20-working day time period, that unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, and the component has discussed with the requester by means of written mail, electronic mail, or by telephone (or has made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request, the component may charge duplication for the processing of the request. Otherwise, it may not charge duplication fees.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution requesters.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution requesters</E> are requesters who are affiliated with an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.</P>
            <P>(ii) Noncommercial scientific institution requesters are entitled to receive 100 pages of duplication without charge. Following the exhaustion of this entitlement, they will be charged fees for the duplicating of any additional pages of responsive records released. They may not be charged search or review fees.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a noncommercial scientific institution request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), it may not charge duplication fees for the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a noncommercial scientific institution request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), when unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), and the component notifies the requester, in writing, within the statutory 20-working day time period, that unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, and the component has discussed with the requester by means of written mail, electronic mail, or by telephone (or has made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request, the component may charge duplication for the processing of the request. Otherwise, it may not charge duplication fees.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Representatives of the news media.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> is any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public, <PRTPAGE P="22"/>including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. For “freelance” journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but components will also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered of commercial use.</P>
            <P>(ii) Representatives of the news media are entitled to receive 100 pages of duplication without charge. Following the exhaustion of this entitlement, they will be charged fees for the duplication of any additional pages of responsive records released. They may not be charged search or review fees.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a news-media use request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), it may not charge duplication fees for the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to a news-media request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), when unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), and the component notifies the requester, in writing, within the statutory 20-working day time period, that unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, and the component has discussed with the requester by means of written mail, electronic mail, or by telephone (or has made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request, the component may charge duplication for the processing of the request. Otherwise, it may not charge duplication fees.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">All other requesters</E> are individuals and entities who do not fall into any of the four categories described in Section 2(b) paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this appendix. Requesters seeking information for personal use, public interest groups, and nonprofit organizations are examples of requesters who might fall into this group.</P>
            <P>(ii) All other requesters are entitled to receive 100 pages of duplication without charge. Following the exhaustion of this entitlement, they will be charged fees for the duplicating of any additional pages of responsive records released. All other requesters are also entitled to receive 2 hours of search time without charge. Following the exhaustion of this entitlement, they may be charged search fees for any remaining search time required to locate the records requested. They may not be charged review fees.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to an all-other request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), it may not charge search fees for the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a component fails to comply with the statutory time limits in which to respond to an all-other request, as provided in 7 CFR 1.6(b), when unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, as discussed in 7 CFR 1.6(d), and the component notifies the requester, in writing, within the statutory 20-working day time period, that unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, and the component has discussed with the requester by means of written mail, electronic mail, or by telephone (or has made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request, the component may charge search fees for the processing of the request as well as any applicable duplication fees. Otherwise, it may only charge applicable duplication fees.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 3. Charging fees.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> When responding to FOIA requests, components will charge all applicable FOIA fees that exceed the USDA charging threshold, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under 7 CFR 1.12(p), or statutory time limits on processing are not met, and when unusual or exceptional circumstances apply, components do not meet all of the three conditions for charging as set forth in 7 CFR 1.12(o).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">USDA fee charging threshold.</E> The OMB Fee Guidelines state that agencies will not charge FOIA fees if the cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. This limitation applies to all requests, including those seeking records for commercial use. At the USDA, the cost of collecting a FOIA fee is currently established as $25.00. Therefore, when calculating FOIA fees, components will charge requesters all applicable FOIA fees when these fees equal or exceed $25.01.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> Components may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing <PRTPAGE P="23"/>the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component. Components will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">NARA retrieval fees.</E> For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by a component at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”), additional costs will be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires a component to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Social Security Numbers and Tax Identification Numbers.</E> Components may not require requesters to provide Social Security Numbers or Tax Identification Numbers in order to pay FOIA fees due.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to all hearings and other proceedings before the Department of Agriculture, except to the extent that any other regulation of the Department may specifically make this section, or any part of this section, inapplicable as to particular hearings or other proceedings.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative provisions.</E> (1) In any hearing or other proceeding before the Department of Agriculture, the parties <PRTPAGE P="24"/>may appear in person or by counsel or other representative. Persons who appear as counsel or in a representative capacity in any hearing or proceeding must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and to any applicable standards of ethical conduct established by statutes, executive orders and regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that a person who is acting or has acted as counsel or representative in any hearing or other proceeding before the Department has not conformed to any such standards of ethical conduct, the Secretary may order that such person be precluded from acting as counsel or representative in any hearing or other proceeding before the Department for such period of time as the Secretary deems warranted. Whenever the Secretary has probable cause to believe that any person who is acting or has acted as counsel or representative in any such hearing or other proceeding has not conformed to any such standards of ethical conduct, the Secretary may, by written notice to such person, suspend the person from acting as such a counsel or representative pending completion of the procedures specified in the preceding sentence.</P>
            <P>(3) No employee or former employee of the Department shall be permitted to represent any person before the Department in connection with any particular matter as to which by reason of employment with the Department the employee or former employee acquired personal knowledge of such a nature that it would be improper, unethical, or contrary to the public interest for the employee or former employee so to act.</P>
            <P>(4) This section shall not be construed to prevent an employee or former employee of the Department from appearing as a witness in any hearing or other proceeding before the Department.</P>

Upon request of any representative of the Secretary involved in connection with the investigation, the subpoena may be issued by the Secretary, the Inspector General, or any Department official authorized pursuant to part 2 of this title to administer the program to which the subpoena relates, if the official who is to issue the subpoena is satisfied as to the reasonableness of the grounds, necessity, and scope of the subpoena. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the authority to issue subpoenas may not be delegated or redelegated by the head of an agency.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Cooperation with television film producers.</E> The Department recognizes that <PRTPAGE P="27"/>its people and programs constitute a rich source of materials on public services, often dramatic and interesting for their human values, which are suitable for production of films for television showings. The Department welcomes the interest of television film producers in its activities and maintains an “open door” policy with respect to the availability of factual information to such producers, as it does to representatives of other media. As its resources will permit, the Department will work with producers at their request, to assure technical accuracy of scripts and story treatments.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Special working relationships.</E> In those instances where a producer of films for television seeks special Department participation such as the use of official insignia of the Department, or who request special assistance such as the services of technical advisors, use of Government equipment and similar aids which require a material expenditure of public funds, and where the proposed film will further the public service of the Department, the Department will consider entering into a special working relationship with such producer.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">News film reporting exempted.</E> Television and news film reporting of Department activities is not covered by this subpart.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If an individual submitting a request for access under § 1.112 has asked that an agency authorize a personal inspection of records pertaining to him or her, and the agency has granted that request, the requester shall present himself or herself at the time and place specified in the agency's response or arrange another, mutually convenient, time with the appropriate agency official.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to inspection of the records, the requester shall present sufficient identification (e.g., driver's license, employee identification card, social security card, credit cards) to establish that the requester is the individual to whom the records pertain. If the requester is unable to provide such identification, the requester shall complete and sign in the presence of an agency official a signed statement asserting the requester's identity and stipulating that the requester understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by fine up to $5,000. No identification shall be required, however, if the records are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released.</P>
            <P>(c) Any individual who has requested access to records about himself or herself by personal inspection, and who wishes to have another person or persons accompany the requester during this inspection, shall submit a written statement authorizing disclosure of the record in the presence of such other person or persons.</P>
            <P>(d) Any individual having made a personal inspection of records pertaining to the requester may request the agency to provide the requester copies of those records or any portion of those records. Each agency shall grant such requests but may charge fees in accordance with § 1.120.</P>

            <P>(e) If an individual submitting a request for access under § 1.112 wishes to be supplied with copies of the records by mail, the requester shall include with his or her request sufficient data for the agency to verify the requester's identity. If the sensitivity of the <PRTPAGE P="30"/>records warrant it, however, the agency to which the request is directed may require the requester to submit a signed, notarized statement indicating that the requester is the individual to whom the records pertain and stipulating the requester understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by fine up to $5,000. No identification shall be required, however, if the records are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released. If the agency to which this request is directed determines to grant the requested access, it may charge fees in accordance with § 1.120 before making the necessary copies.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.114</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Disclosure of requested information to individuals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any agency which receives a request or appeal under § 1.112 should acknowledge the request or appeal within 10 days of its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Wherever practicable, the acknowledgment should indicate whether or not access will be granted and, if so, when and where. When access is to be granted, the agency should provide the access within 30 days of receipt of the request or appeal (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) unless, for good cause shown, it is unable to do so. If the agency is unable to meet this deadline, it shall inform the requester of this fact, the reasons for its inability to do so, and an estimate of the date on which access will be granted.</P>
            <P>(b) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart shall be interpreted to require that an individual making a request under § 1.112 be granted access to the physical record itself. The form in which a record is kept (e.g., on magnetic tape), or the content of the record (e.g., a record indexed under the name of the requester may contain records which are not about the requester) may require that the record be edited or translated in some manner. Neither of these procedures may be utilized, however, to withhold information in a record about the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) No agency shall deny any request under § 1.112 for information concerning the existence of records about the requester in any system of records it maintains, or deny any request for access to records about the requester in any system of records it maintains, unless that system is exempted from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) in § 1.123.</P>
            <P>(d) If any agency receives a request pursuant to § 1.112(a) for access to records in a system of records it maintains which is so exempted, the system manager shall determine if the exemption is to be asserted. If the system manager determines to deny the request, the system manager shall inform the requester of that determination, the reason for the determination, and the title and address of the agency head to whom the denial can be appealed.</P>
            <P>(e) If the head of an agency determines that an appeal pursuant to § 1.112(b) is to be denied, the head of the agency shall inform the requester of that determination, the reason for the determination, and the requester's right under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) to seek judicial review of the denial in Federal district court.</P>
            <P>(f) Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>

            <P>(b) Any individual submitting a request pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall include sufficient information in support of that request to allow the agency to which it is addressed to apply the standards set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (1) and (5).</P>

            <P>(1) Make any correction, deletion or addition with regard to any portion of a record which the requester believes is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete; or</P>
            <P>(2) Inform the requester of its refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request; the reason for the refusal; the procedures whereby the requester can appeal the refusal to the head of the agency; and the title and business address of that official. If the agency informs the requester of its determination within the 10-day deadline, a separate acknowledgement is not required.</P>

            <P>(2) Make the requested correction or amendment; and</P>

            <P>The failure to file an answer, or the admission by the answer of all the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint, shall constitute a waiver of hearing. Upon such admission or failure to file, complainant shall file a proposed decision, along with a motion for the adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon the respondent by the Hearing Clerk. Within 20 days after service of such motion and proposed decision, the respondent may file with the Hearing Clerk objections thereto.

If meritorious objections are not filed, the Judge shall issue a decision without further procedure or hearing. Copies of the decision or denial of complainant's Motion shall be served by the Hearing Clerk upon each of the parties and may be appealed pursuant to § 1.145. Where the decision as proposed by complainant is entered, such decision shall become final and effective without further proceedings 35 days after the date of service thereof upon the respondent, unless there is an appeal to the Judicial Officer by a party to the proceeding pursuant to § 1.145: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That no decision shall be final for purposes of judicial review except a final decision of the Judicial Officer upon appeal.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> (1) Upon motion of a party or upon the Judge's own motion, the Judge may direct the parties or their counsel to attend a conference at any reasonable time, prior to or during the course of the hearing, when the Judge finds that the proceeding would be expedited by a conference. Reasonable notice of the time, place, and manner of the conference shall be given. The Judge may order each of the parties to furnish at or subsequent to the conference any or all of the following:<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) An outline of the case or defense;</P>
            <P>(ii) The legal theories upon which the party will rely;</P>
            <P>(iii) Copies of or a list of documents which the party anticipates introducing at the hearing; and</P>
            <P>(iv) A list of anticipated witnesses who will testify on behalf of the party. At the discretion of the party furnishing such list of witnesses, the names of the witnesses need not be furnished if they are otherwise identified in some meaningful way such as a short statement of the type of evidence they will offer.</P>
            <P>(2) The Judge shall not order any of the foregoing procedures that a party can show is inappropriate or unwarranted under the circumstances of the particular case.</P>
            <P>(3) At the conference, the following matters shall be considered:</P>
            <P>(i) The simplification of issues;</P>
            <P>(ii) The necessity of amendments to pleadings;</P>
            <P>(iii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;</P>
            <P>(iv) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;</P>
            <P>(v) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;</P>
            <P>(vi) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;</P>
            <P>(vii) The identification of documents or matters of which official notice may be requested;</P>
            <P>(viii) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the actions decided at the conference; and</P>
            <P>(ix) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> A conference will not be stenographically reported unless so directed by the Judge.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Manner of Conference.</E> (1) The conference shall be conducted by telephone or correspondence unless the Judge determines that conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication:</P>
            <P>(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or correspondence. If the Judge determines that a conference conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by telephone, or by correspondence.</P>
            <P>(2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the Judge determines that conducting the conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference:</P>
            <P>(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Order.</E> Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be reduced to a written appropriate order, unless the Judge concludes that a stenographic report shall suffice, or, if the conference takes place within 7 days of the beginning of the hearing, the Judge elects to make a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Related matters.</E> Upon motion of a respondent, the Judge may order the attorney for the complainant to produce and permit the respondent to inspect and copy or photograph any relevant written or recorded statements or confessions made by such respondent within the possession, custody or control of the complainant.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for hearing.</E> Any party may request a hearing on the facts by including such request in the complaint or answer, or by a separate request, in writing, filed with the Hearing Clerk within the time in which an answer may be filed. A petition for review shall be deemed a request for a hearing. Failure to request a hearing <PRTPAGE P="43"/>within the time allowed for the filing of the answer shall constitute a waiver of such hearing. Waiver of hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to request oral argument before the Judicial Officer upon appeal of the Judge's decision. In the event the respondent denies any material fact and fails to file a timely request for a hearing, the matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the complainant or upon the Judge's own motion.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time, place, and manner.</E> (1) If any material issue of fact is joined by the pleadings, the Judge, upon motion of any party stating that the matter is at issue and is ready for hearing, shall set a time, place, and manner for hearing as soon as feasible after the motion is filed, with due regard for the public interest and the convenience and necessity of the parties. The Judge shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> This notice shall state whether the hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to participate in the hearing. The Judge's determination regarding the manner of the hearing shall be made in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. If any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing is made, the Judge shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be served upon the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice is given to the parties.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> The place of hearing in a proceeding under the Packers and Stockyards Act shall be set in accordance with the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 228(e) and (f)). In essence, if there is only one respondent, the hearing is to be held as near as possible to the respondent's place of business or residence depending on the availability of an appropriate location for conducting the hearing. If there is more than one respondent and they have their places of business or residence within a single unit of local government, a single geographical area within a State, or a single State, the hearing is to be held as near as possible to their places of business or residence depending on the availability of an appropriate location for conducting the hearing. If there is more than one respondent, and they have their places of business or residence distant from each other, 7 U.S.C. 228(e) and (f) have no applicability.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(2)(i) If any material issue of fact is joined by the pleadings and the matter is at issue and is ready for hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.</P>
            <P>(ii) Within 10 days after the Judge issues a notice stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that the Judge reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in accordance with the Judges's notice.</P>
            <P>(3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the Judge determines that conducting the hearing by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing:</P>
            <P>(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the hearing; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication. If the Judge determines that a hearing conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.</P>

            <P>(4) The Judge may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct <PRTPAGE P="44"/>the hearing by telephone if the Judge finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:</P>
            <P>(i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;</P>
            <P>(ii) Would not prejudice any party; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appearances.</E> The parties may appear in person or by attorney of record in the proceeding. Any person who appears as attorney must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Debarment of attorney.</E> (1) Whenever a Judge finds that a person acting as attorney for any party to the proceeding is guilty of unethical or contumacious conduct, in or in connection with a proceeding , the Judge may order that such person be precluded from further acting as attorney in the proceeding. An appeal to the Judicial Officer may be taken from any such order, but no proceeding shall be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Judge shall suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain another attorney.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever it is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that a person, who is acting or has acted as attorney for another person in any proceeding before the United States Department of Agriculture, is unfit to act as such counsel because of such unethical or contumacious conduct, such person will be precluded from acting as counsel in any or all proceedings before the Department as found to be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> (1) A respondent who, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without good cause, shall be deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding and to have admitted any facts which may be presented at the hearing. Such failure by the respondent shall also constitute an admission of all the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint. Complainant shall have an election whether to follow the procedure set forth in § 1.139 or whether to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony before the Judge. Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the Judge's decision and to appeal and request oral argument before the Judicial Officer with respect thereto in the manner provided in § 1.145.</P>
            <P>(2) If the petitioner in the case of a Petition for Review of a determination of responsibly connected status within the meaning of 7 U.S.C. 499a(b)(9), having been duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without good cause, such petitioner shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and to have voluntarily withdrawn the petition for review.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Order of proceeding.</E> Except as may be determined otherwise by the Judge, the complainant shall proceed first at the hearing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Written statements of direct testimony.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the Judge finds that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.</P>

            <P>(2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less than 20 days <PRTPAGE P="45"/>after the Judge's notice stating the time of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> (i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.</P>
            <P>(ii) Upon a finding of good cause, the Judge may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(iii) After a witness called by the complainant has testified on direct examination, any other party may request and obtain the production of any statement, or part thereof, of such witness in the possession of the complainant which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. Such production shall be made according to the procedures and subject to the definitions and limitations prescribed in the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500).</P>
            <P>(iv) Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> (i) If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination or to any other ruling of the Judge, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge.</P>
            <P>(ii) Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Depositions.</E> The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of § 1.148.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Unless the Judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, four copies of each exhibit shall be filed with the Judge: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, where there are more than two parties in the proceeding, an additional copy shall be filed for each additional party. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Official records or documents.</E> An official government record or document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the relevant facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such certification.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice shall be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the parties shall be given adequate notice of matters so noticed, and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded by the Judge, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript or recording in toto. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record. In either event, the evidence shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording and hearing record if the Judicial Officer, upon appeal, decides the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial. If the Judicial Officer decides the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial and that it would be inappropriate to have such evidence considered a part of the hearing record, the Judicial Officer may direct that the hearing be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence or for any other purpose in connection with the excluded evidence.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Transcript or recording.</E> (1) Hearings to be conducted by telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing shall be transcribed, unless the Judge finds that recording the hearing <PRTPAGE P="46"/>verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the Judge orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The Judge shall certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the Judge determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the Judge shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.</P>
            <P>(3) Recordings or transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at actual cost of duplication.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of petition.</E> Within 30 days after receiving service of the Judge's decision, if the decision is a written decision, or within 30 days after issuance of the Judge's decision, if the decision is an oral decision, a party who disagrees with the decision, any part of the decision, or any ruling by the Judge or who alleges any deprivation of rights, may appeal the decision to the Judicial Officer by filing an appeal petition with the Hearing Clerk. As provided in § 1.141(h)(2), objections regarding evidence or a limitation regarding examination or cross-examination or other ruling made before the Judge may be relied upon in an appeal. Each issue set forth in the appeal petition and the arguments regarding each issue shall be separately numbered; shall be plainly and concisely stated; and shall contain detailed citations to the record, statutes, regulations, or authorities being relied upon in support of each argument. A brief may be filed in support of the appeal simultaneously with the appeal petition.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response to appeal petition.</E> Within 20 days after the service of a copy of an appeal petition and any brief in support thereof, filed by a party to the proceeding, any other party may file with the Hearing Clerk a response in support of or in opposition to the appeal and in such response any relevant issue, not presented in the appeal petition, may be raised.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Transmittal of record.</E> Whenever an appeal of a Judge's decision is filed and a response thereto has been filed or time for filing a response has expired, the Hearing Clerk shall transmit to the Judicial Officer the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: the pleadings; motions and requests filed and rulings thereon; the transcript or recording of the testimony taken at the hearing, together with the exhibits filed in connection therewith; any documents or papers filed in connection with a prehearing conference; such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders, and briefs in support thereof, as may have been filed in connection with the proceeding; the Judge's decision; such exceptions, statements of objections and briefs in support thereof as may have been filed in the proceeding; and the appeal petition, and such briefs in support thereof and responses thereto as may have been filed in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Oral argument.</E> A party bringing an appeal may request, within the prescribed time for filing such appeal, an opportunity for oral argument before the Judicial Officer. Within the time allowed for filing a response, appellee may file a request in writing for opportunity for such an oral argument. Failure to make such request in writing, within the prescribed time period, shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument. The Judicial Officer may grant, refuse, or limit any request for oral argument. Oral argument shall not be transcribed unless so ordered in advance by the Judicial Officer for good cause shown upon request of a party or upon the Judicial Officer's own motion.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Scope of argument.</E> Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral or on brief, shall be limited to the issues raised in the appeal or in the response to the appeal, except that if the Judicial Officer determines that additional issues should be argued, the parties shall be given reasonable notice of such determination, so as to permit preparation of adequate arguments on all issues to be argued.</P>

A request for postponement of the argument must be made by motion filed a reasonable amount of time in advance of the date fixed for argument.</P>

            <P>(h) <E T="03">Submission on briefs.</E> By agreement of the parties, an appeal may be submitted for decision on the briefs, but the Judicial Officer may direct that the appeal be argued orally.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Decision of the judicial officer on appeal.</E> As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record from the Hearing Clerk, or, in case oral argument was had, as soon as practicable thereafter, the Judicial Officer, upon the basis of and after due consideration of the record and any matter of which official notice is taken, shall rule on the appeal. If the Judicial Officer decides that no change or modification of the Judge's decision is warranted, the Judicial Officer may adopt the Judge's decision as the final order in the proceeding, preserving any right of the party bringing the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision in the proper forum. A final order issued by the Judicial Officer shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Such order may be regarded by the respondent as final for purposes of judicial review without filing a petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of the decision of the Judicial Officer.</P>

Every such petition must state specifically the grounds relied upon. Any such petition filed prior to the filing of an appeal of the Judge's decision pursuant to § 1.145 shall be ruled upon by the Judge, and any such petition filed thereafter shall be ruled upon by the Judicial Officer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Petition to reopen hearing.</E> A petition to reopen a hearing to take further evidence may be filed at any time prior to the issuance of the decision of the Judicial Officer.

As soon as practicable thereafter, the Judge or the Judicial Officer, as the case may be, shall announce the determination whether to grant or deny the petition. The decision of the Judicial Officer shall automatically be stayed pending the determination to grant or deny a timely petition.

In the event that any such petition is granted, the applicable rules of practice, as set out elsewhere herein, shall be followed. A person filing a petition under this section shall be regarded as the moving party, although such person shall be referred to as the complainant or respondent, depending upon the designation in the original proceeding.</P>

            <P>(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or</P>

            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure on examination.</E> (1) The deponent shall be examined under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. Objections to questions or documents shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon. The questions proponded, together with all objections made (but not including argument or debate), shall be recorded verbatim. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit written questions to the officer prior to the examination and the officer shall propound such questions to the deponent.</P>
            <P>(2) The applicant shall arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination, or by written questions upon agreement of the parties or as directed by the Judge. If the examination is conducted by means of written questions, copies of the applicant's questions must be received by the other party to the proceeding and the officer at least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise agreed, and any cross questions of a party other than the applicant must be received by the applicant and the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification by officer.</E> The officer shall certify on the deposition that the deponent was duly sworn and that the deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony.

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Corrections to the transcript or recording.</E> (1) At any time prior to the hearing, any party may file a motion proposing corrections to the transcript or recording of the deposition.</P>

            <P>(3) At any time prior to use of the deposition in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section and after consideration of any objections filed thereto, the Judge may issue an order making any corrections in the transcript or recording which the Judge finds are warranted, which corrections shall be entered onto the original transcript or recording by the Hearing Clerk (without obscuring the original text).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of deposition.</E> A deposition ordered and taken in accordance with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under these rules if the Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and (1) that the witness is dead; (2) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; (3) that the party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena, but has been unable to do so; or (4) that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If the party upon whose motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any part thereof in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a <PRTPAGE P="53"/>party, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</P>

The conference may include discussions regarding:</P>
            <P>(1) Simplification of the issues;</P>
            <P>(2) Limitation of expert or other witnesses;</P>
            <P>(3) The orderly presentation of evidence; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time and place.</E> The oral hearing shall be held at such time and place as specified in the complaint, and not less than 30 days after service thereof. The time and place of the hearing may be changed for good cause, by the Judge, upon motion of either complainant or respondent.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Manner of hearing.</E> (1) The Judge shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice stating whether the hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing and the Judge's determination regarding the manner of hearing shall be made in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. If any change in the manner of the hearing is made, the Judge shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice of the change, which notice shall be served on the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice is given to the parties.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.</P>
            <P>(ii) Within 10 days after the Judge issues a notice stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that the Judge reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in accordance with the Judges's notice.</P>
            <P>(3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the Judge determines that conducting the hearing by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing:</P>
            <P>(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the hearing; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication. If the Judge determines that a hearing conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.</P>
            <P>(4) The Judge may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if the Judge finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:</P>
            <P>(i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;</P>
            <P>(ii) Would not prejudice any party; and</P>

            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication or personal attendance <PRTPAGE P="57"/>of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appearances.</E> The parties may appear in person or by counsel or by other representative. Persons who appear as counsel or in a representative capacity must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Order of proceeding.</E> Except as otherwise may be agreed by the parties and approved by the Judge, the complainant shall proceed first at the hearing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If respondent, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, and no good cause for such failure is established, complainant shall present a <E T="03">prime facie</E> case on the matters denied in the answer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Written statements of direct testimony.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the Judge finds that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.</P>
            <P>(2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less than 20 days after the Judge's notice stating the time of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> (1) The testimony of witnesses at the hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation, transcribed or recorded verbatim, and subject to cross-examination. Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination, the party shall briefly state the grounds of such objections, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge. The ruling of the Judge on any objection shall be part of the transcript or recording. Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Official records or documents.</E> An official record or document, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and shall be <E T="03">prima facie</E> evidence of the relevant facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof, or by a copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such certification.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Unless the Judge finds that the furnishing of multiple copies is impracticable, four copies of each exhibit shall be filed with the Judge unless the Judge finds that a greater or lesser number is desirable. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice shall be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the opposing party shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is deleted from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript or recording in toto. In such event, it <PRTPAGE P="58"/>shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording and record if the Judicial Officer decides that the Judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial. The Judge shall not allow the insertion of such excluded evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume considerable time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the Judicial Officer decides that the Judge's ruling excluding the evidence was both prejudicial and erroneous, the hearing may be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Affidavits.</E> Affidavits may be submitted into evidence, in lieu of witness testimony, only to the extent, and in the manner agreed upon by the parties.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Transcript or recording.</E> (1) Hearings to be conducted by telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing shall be transcribed, unless the Judge finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the Judge orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The Judge shall certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the Judge determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the Judge shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.</P>
            <P>(3) Recordings or transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at actual cost of duplication.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeal to the Judicial Officer.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of petition.</E> Within 30 days after receiving service of the Judge's decision, a party who disagrees with the decision, or any part thereof, or any ruling by the Judge or any alleged deprivation of rights, may appeal such decision to the Judicial Officer by filing an appeal petition with the Hearing Clerk. As provided in § 1.168(g)(2), objections regarding evidence or a limitation regarding examination or cross-examination or other ruling made before the Judge may be relied upon in an appeal. Each issue set forth in the petition, and the arguments thereon, shall be separately numbered; shall be plainly and concisely stated; and shall contain detailed citations to the record, statutes, regulations or authorities being relied upon in support thereof. A brief may be filed in support of the appeal simultaneously with the petition.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response to appeal petition.</E> Within 20 days after the service of a copy of an appeal petition and any brief in support thereof, filed by a party to the proceeding, any other party may file with the Hearing Clerk a response in support of or in opposition to the appeal and in such response any relevant issue, not presented in the appeal petition, may be raised.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Transmittal of record.</E> Whenever an appeal of a Judge's decision is filed and a response thereto has been filed or time for filing a response has expired, the Hearing Clerk shall transmit to the Judicial Officer the record of the proceeding. Such record shall include: the pleadings; motions and requests filed and rulings thereon; the transcript or recording of the testimony taken at the hearing, together with the exhibits filed in connection therewith; any documents or papers filed in connection with a prehearing conference; such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders, and briefs in support thereof, as may have been filed in connection with the proceeding; the Judge's decision; such exceptions, statements of objections and briefs in support thereof as may have been filed in the proceeding; and the appeal petition, and such briefs in support thereof and responses thereto as may have been filed in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Oral argument.</E> A party bringing an appeal may request, within the prescribed time for filing such appeal, an opportunity for oral arguments before the Judicial Officer. Within the time allowed for filing a response, appellee may file a request in writing for opportunity for such an oral argument. Failure to make such request in writing, within the prescribed time period, shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument. The Judicial Officer may grant, refuse, or limit any request for oral argument. Oral argument shall not be transcribed unless so ordered in advance by the Judicial Officer for good cause shown upon request of a party or upon the Judicial Officer's own motion.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Scope of argument.</E> Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral or on brief, shall be limited to the issues raised in the appeal or in the response to the appeal, except that if the Judicial Officer determines that additional issues should be argued, the parties shall be given reasonable notice of such determination, so as to permit preparation of adequate arguments on all issues to be argued.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of argument; Postponement.</E> The Hearing Clerk shall advise all parties of the time and place at which oral argument will be heard. A request for postponement of the argument must be made by motion filed a reasonable amount of time in advance of the date fixed for argument.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Order of argument.</E> The appellant is entitled to open and conclude the argument.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Submission on briefs.</E> By agreement of the parties, an appeal may be submitted for decision on the briefs, but the Judicial Officer may direct that the appeal be argued orally.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Decision of the judicial officer on appeal.</E> As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record from the Hearing Clerk, or, in case oral argument was had, as soon as practicable thereafter, the Judicial Officer, upon the basis of and after due consideration of the record and any matter of which official notice is taken, shall rule on the appeal. If the Judicial Officer decides that no change or modification of the Judge's decision is warranted, the Judicial Officer may adopt the Judge's <PRTPAGE P="60"/>decision as the final order in the proceeding, preserving any right of the party bringing the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision in the proper forum. A final order issued by the Judicial Officer shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Such order may be regarded by the respondent as final for purposes of a request for judicial review as provided in § 1.175(a).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose of these rules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “EAJA” in this subpart), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Department. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Department unless the position of the Department was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. Alternatively, an eligible party may receive an award in connection with an adversary adjudication arising from an agency action to enforce the party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement where the demand by the agency is substantially in excess of the decision of the adjudicative officer and is unreasonable when compared with such decision under the facts and circumstances of the case. The rules in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Department will use to make awards.</P>

In addition, the provisions of § 1.185(b) relating to award for excessive demand apply only to adversary adjudications commenced on or after March 29, 1996. Changes in maximum rates for attorney fees are effective as of October 11, 2002.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1.183</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Proceedings covered.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The rules in this subpart apply to adversary adjudications. These are:</P>
              <P>(i) Adjudications required by statute to be conducted by the Department under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Department or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding,</P>
              <P>(ii) Appeals of decisions of contracting officers made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before the Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals as provided in section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607), and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any hearing conducted under chapter 38 of title 31, United States Code.</P>

              <P>(2) Any proceeding in which the Department may prescribe a lawful present or future rate is not covered by EAJA. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses also are excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.” The proceedings covered include adversary adjudications under the following statutory provisions.

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under EAJA, the applicant must meet one of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant must be a prevailing party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award; or</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant must be a party to an adversary adjudication arising from an agency action to enforce the party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement in which the demand by the agency was substantially in excess of the decision of the adjudicative officer and the demand is unreasonable when compared with such decision under the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the criteria set out in paragraph (a) of this section, a party seeking an award must be one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
              <P>(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (2 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and nor more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(6) For purposes only of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a small entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adversary adjudication was initiated: Provided, that for purposes of eligibility in proceedings covered by § 1.183(a)(1)(ii) of this part, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the applicant filed its appeal under 41 U.S.C. 606.</P>
              <P>(d) In interpreting the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the following apply:</P>
              <P>(1) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
              <P>(2) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</P>

              <P>(3) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this subpart, unless the adjudicative officer determines such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of EAJA in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute <PRTPAGE P="65"/>special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(4) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other person or entity that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards for awards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Prevailing party. (1) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Department was substantially justified. The position of the Department includes, in addition to the position taken by the Department in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Department upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant because the position of the Department was substantially justified is on the agency.</P>
              <P>(2) An award to a prevailing applicant will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>
              <P>(b) Excessive demand. (1) If, in an adversary adjudication arising from an agency action to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement, the demand by the agency is substantially in excess of the decision of the adjudicative officer and is unreasonable when compared with such decision under the facts and circumstances of the case, the adjudicative officer shall award to the party the fees and other expenses related to defending against the excessive demand, unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. Fees and expenses awarded under this paragraph shall be paid only as a consequence of appropriations provided in advance.</P>
              <P>(2) “Demand” means the express demand of the agency which led to the adversary adjudication, but does not include a recitation by the agency of the maximum statutory penalty:</P>
              <P>(i) In the administrative complaint, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Elsewhere when accompanied by an express demand for a lesser amount.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1.186</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at reduced rate to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(b) In proceedings commenced on or after the effective date of this paragraph, no award for the fee of an attorney or agent under the rules in this subpart may exceed $150 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses, which is set out at § 1.150 of this part. However, an award also may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
              <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:</P>
              <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
              <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
              <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
              <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>

              <P>(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or <PRTPAGE P="66"/>other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>

              <P>(a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Department may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $150 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Department will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Any person may file with the Department a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees in accordance with § 1.28 of this part. The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Department should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It also should explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Department will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.</P>

              <P>(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under EAJA shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business. The application shall also:</P>
              <P>(1) Show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Department that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified and shall briefly state the basis for such allegation; or</P>
              <P>(2) Show that the demand by the Department in the proceeding was substantially in excess of, and was unreasonable when compared with, the decision in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) The application also shall, as appropriate, include a declaration that the applicant is a small entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601 or a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:</P>

              <P>(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt <PRTPAGE P="67"/>status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or</P>
              <P>(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 114j(a)).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Net worth exhibit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 1.184 of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>
              <P>(b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1) through (9). The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the established procedures of the Department under the Freedom of Information Act (§§ 1.1 through 1.23 of this part).</P>

              <P>(b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from any attorney, agent, or expert witness representing or appearing on behalf of the party, stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed and describing the specific services performed.</P>
              <P>(1) The affidavit shall state the services performed. In order to establish the hourly rate, the affidavit shall state the hourly rate which is billed and paid by the majority of clients during the relevant time periods.</P>
              <P>(2) If no hourly rate is paid by the majority of clients because, for instance, the attorney or agent represents most clients on a contingency basis, the attorney or agent shall provide information about two attorneys or agents with similar experience, who perform similar work, stating their hourly rate.</P>

              <P>(c) The documentation also shall include a description of any expenses for which reimbursement is sought and a statement of the amounts paid and payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided.<PRTPAGE P="68"/>

              <P>(b) For the purposes of this subpart, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, become final and unappealable, both within the Department and to the courts.</P>
              <P>(c) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.</P>

            <P>(a) An employee of USDA served with a valid summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process demanding his or her appearance, or otherwise requested to appear on behalf of a party other than the United States in a judicial or administrative proceeding in which the United States is not a party, shall promptly notify the head of his or her USDA agency of the existence and nature of the order compelling his or her appearance, or of the document requesting his or her attendance. He or she shall also specify, if that is known, the nature of the judicial or administrative proceeding and the nature of the testimony or documents requested.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) An employee of USDA served with a valid summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process, or requested to appear as a witness on behalf of a party other than the United States in a judicial or administrative proceeding in which the United States is not a party, may appear only if such appearance has been authorized by the head of his or her USDA agency, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, based upon a determination that such an appearance is in the interest of USDA.</P>
            <P>(2) An employee of USDA requested to appear as a witness on behalf of a party other than the United States in a judicial or administrative proceeding in which the United States is not a party, without the service of a valid summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process, may appear only if such appearance has been authorized by the head of his or her USDA agency and approved by the appropriate Assistant Secretary, Under Secretary or other general officer, and by the General Counsel, based upon a determination that such an appearance is in the interest of USDA.</P>
            <P>(c) Unless an appearance is authorized as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the employee shall appear at the stated time and place (unless advised by the General Counsel or his or her designee that the summons, subpoena, or other process was not validly issued or served), produce a copy of these regulations and respectfully decline to provide any testimony.

            <P>(d) If there is any question regarding the validity of a summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process, an employee shall contact the Office of the General Counsel for advice.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) In determining whether the employee's appearance is in the interest of USDA, authorizing officials should consider the following:</P>
            <P>(i) what interest of USDA would be promoted by the employee's testimony;</P>
            <P>(ii) whether an appearance would result in an unnecessary interference with the duties of the USDA employee;</P>
            <P>(iii) whether an employee's testimony would result in the appearance of improperly favoring one litigant over another.</P>

            <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the judicial officer, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>

            <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the judicial officer in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the false, fictitious, or fraudulent <PRTPAGE P="86"/>claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>

            <P>(3) The degree of the respondent's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
            <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
            <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
            <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
            <P>(8) Whether the respondent has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> (1) Upon motion of a party of record or upon the Judge's own motion, the Judge may direct the parties or their counsel to attend a conference at any reasonable time, prior to or during the course of the hearing, when the Judge finds that the proceeding would be expedited by a prehearing conference. Reasonable notice of the time and place of the conference shall be given. The Judge may order each of the parties to furnish at or subsequent to the conference any or all of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) An outline of a party's position;</P>
            <P>(ii) The facts upon which the party will rely;</P>
            <P>(iii) The legal theories upon which the party will rely;</P>
            <P>(iv) Copies of or a list of documents which the party anticipates introducing at the hearing; and</P>
            <P>(v) A list of anticipated witnesses who will testify on behalf of the party. At the discretion of the party furnishing such list of witnesses, the names of the witnesses need not be furnished if they are otherwise identified in some meaningful way such as a short statement of the type of evidence they will offer.</P>
            <P>(2) The Judge shall not order any of the foregoing procedures that a party can show is inappropriate or unwarranted under the circumstances of the particular determination.</P>
            <P>(3) At the conference, the following matters shall be considered:</P>
            <P>(i) The simplification of issues;</P>
            <P>(ii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;</P>
            <P>(iii) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;</P>
            <P>(iv) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;</P>

            <P>(viii) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> A prehearing conference will not be stenographically reported unless so directed by the Judge.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Action in lieu of personal attendance at a conference.</E> In the event the Judge concludes that personal attendance by the Judge and the parties or counsel at a prehearing conference is unwarranted or impracticable, but determines that a conference would expedite the proceeding, the Judge may conduct such conference by telephone or correspondence.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Order.</E> Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be reduced to an appropriate written order, unless the Judge concludes that a stenographic report shall suffice, or if the Judge elects to make a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.</P>

            <P>(iv) Evidence which is immaterial, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> (i) If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination or to any other ruling of the Judge, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge.</P>
            <P>(ii) Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Depositions.</E> The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of § 1.228 of these procedures.</P>

A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Official records or documents.</E> An official government record or document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the relevant facts stated therein. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof or a copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such certification.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice shall be taken of such matters as are judicially noted by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the parties shall be given adequate notice of matters so noticed, and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded by the Judge, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript in toto. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record.</P>

Objections to questions or documents shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon.

In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit written questions to the officer prior to the examination and the officer shall propound such questions to the deponent.</P>
            <P>(2) The applicant shall arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination, or by written questions upon agreement of the parties or as directed by the Judge.

            <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of deposition.</E> A deposition ordered and taken in accordance with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under these rules if the Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and that the witness is dead; that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If the party upon whose motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any thereof in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced and any party may introduce any other parts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy on employee indemnification.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Indemnification, under the context of this section, shall be the policy <PRTPAGE P="100"/>whereby the Department of Agriculture compensates an employee for the legal consequences of conduct, taken within the scope of his or her employment, giving rise to a verdict, judgment, or other monetary award rendered against the employee.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department of Agriculture may indemnify a Department employee (which for the purposes of this regulation shall include a former employee) for any verdict, judgment, or other monetary award rendered against such employee, provided the Secretary or the Secretary's designee determines, in his or her discretion, that the conduct giving rise to such verdict, judgment, or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Department, and such indemnification is in the interest of the United States.</P>
            <P>(c) The Department of Agriculture may pay for the settlement or compromise of a personal damage claim against a Department employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided that the Secretary or the Secretary's designee determines, in his or her discretion, that the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of the employee's employment, and such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request to agree to indemnify or pay for a settlement of a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse judgment, verdict, or other monetary award.</P>
            <P>(e) When a Department employee becomes aware that an action has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify his or her supervisor that such an action is pending. The supervisor shall promptly thereafter notify the Office of the General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(f) A Department employee may request indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment, or monetary award entered against the employee or to satisfy the requirements of a settlement proposal. The employee shall submit a written request, with appropriate documentation that includes a copy of the verdict, judgment, award or settlement proposal, as appropriate, to the head of his or her employing component, who shall thereupon submit it to the General Counsel, in a timely manner, a recommended disposition of the request. The Office of the General Counsel shall seek the views of the Department of Justice. The Office of the General Counsel shall forward the employee's request, the employing component's recommendation, and the General Counsel's recommendation, along with the time frame in which a decision is needed, to the Secretary or his or her designee for decision. The Secretary or his or her designee will decide promptly whether to indemnify or pay for a settlement of a personal damage claim.</P>
            <P>(g) Any payment under this section to indemnify a Department employee for a personal damage verdict, judgment, or award or to settle a personal damage claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the employing component of the United States Department of Agriculture.</P>

              <P>(2) The hearing process under this part does not apply to recommendations that the Forest Service may submit to FERC under FPA section 10(a), 16 U.S.C. 803(a).</P>
              <P>(3) The FPA also grants the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior the authority to develop mandatory conditions and prescriptions for inclusion in a hydropower license. Where the Forest Service and either or both of these other Departments develop conditions or prescriptions to be included in the same hydropower license and where the Departments agree to consolidate the hearings under § 1.623:</P>
              <P>(i) A hearing conducted under this subpart will also address disputed issues of material fact with respect to any condition or prescription developed by one of the other Departments; or</P>

              <P>(ii) A hearing requested under this subpart will be conducted by one of the other Departments, pursuant to 43 CFR 45.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E> or 50 CFR 221.1 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) The regulations in §§ 1.601 through 1.660 will be construed and applied to each hearing process to achieve a just and speedy determination, consistent with adequate consideration of the issues involved and the provisions of § 1.660(a).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternatives process.</E> The regulations in §§ 1.670 through 1.674 contain rules of procedure applicable to the submission and consideration of alternative conditions under FPA section 33, 16 U.S.C. 823d. That section allows any party to the license proceeding to propose an alternative to a condition deemed necessary by the Forest Service under section 4(e).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reserved authority.</E> Where the Forest Service has notified or notifies FERC that it is reserving its authority to develop one or more conditions at a later time, the hearing and alternatives processes under this subpart for such conditions will be available if and when the Forest Service exercises its reserved authority.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart applies to any hydropower license proceeding for which the license had not been issued as of November 17, 2005, and for which one or more preliminary conditions have been or are filed with FERC before FERC issues the license.</P>
              <P>(2) This subpart also applies to any exercise of the Forest Service's reserved authority under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to a hydropower license issued before or after November 17, 2005.</P>

Such discovery will be permitted only if:</P>
              <P>(1) The expert is expected to be a witness at the hearing; or</P>

              <P>(i) Will be unable to attend the hearing because of age, illness, or other incapacity; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Is unwilling to attend the hearing voluntarily, and the party is unable to compel the witness's attendance at the hearing by subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply to any person employed by or under contract with the party seeking the deposition.</P>
              <P>(3) A party may depose a senior Department employee only if the party shows:</P>
              <P>(i) That the employee's testimony is necessary in order to provide significant, unprivileged information that is not available from any other source or by less burdensome means; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That the deposition would not significantly interfere with the employee's ability to perform his or her government duties.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless otherwise stipulated to by the parties or authorized by the ALJ upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Completion of discovery.</E> All discovery must be completed within 25 days after the initial prehearing conference.</P>

              <P>Yes. This subpart contains provisions in §§ 1.670 through 1.674 that would collect information from the public. It therefore requires approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (PRA). According to the PRA, a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number that indicates OMB approval. OMB has reviewed the information collection in this rule and approved it under OMB control number 1094-0001.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appearances</E>—(1) <E T="03">Right to appear.</E> Any interested person shall be given an opportunity to appear, as a witness, with or without, authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with respect to matters relevant and material to the proceeding, provided that such interested person complies with §§ 1.804, 1.807, and any alternative procedures included in the hearing notice pursuant to § 1.803. In addition to compliance with any witness instructions set forth in the notice of hearing, any witness who desires to be heard in person at any hearing shall, before proceeding to testify do so under oath or affirmation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Appearance with or through counsel or representative.</E> (i) A witness may appear with counsel or a representative if the witness identifies the counsel or representative in the notification submitted pursuant to § 1.804.</P>
            <P>(ii) The counsel or representative shall, before proceeding with the witness testimony, state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or representative, and the names, addresses, and occupations of such counsel or representative.</P>
            <P>(iii) The witness or his or her counsel or representative shall give such other information respecting the witness' appearance as the Judge may request.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Debarment of counsel or representative.</E> (i) Whenever, while a proceeding is pending before the Judge, such Judge finds that a person, acting as counsel or representative for any party or witness, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the Judge may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such proceeding.</P>
            <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(iii) In case the Judge has ordered that a person be precluded from further action as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the Judge within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If any interested person, who complied with §§ 1.804, 1.807, fails to appear at the hearing, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to be heard in the proceeding and such failure to appear shall result in the exclusion of that person's written testimony.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Order of procedure.</E> (1) The Judge shall, at the opening of the hearing prior to the taking of testimony, note as part of the record the notice of hearing as published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
            <P>(2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the Judge shall announce.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The hearing shall be publicly conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.</P>
            <P>(i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or make an affirmation.</P>
            <P>(ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the hearing, the Judge may:</P>
            <P>(A) Limit the number of times any witness may testify to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative evidence.</P>
            <P>(B) Limit cross examination of a witness by time, scope, or as appropriate, provided that the Judge announces the time limit at the beginning of the hearing, prior to the taking of testimony.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Judge shall exclude from the record evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to any other ruling of the Judge during the hearing, such party shall state briefly the grounds of such <PRTPAGE P="126"/>objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the Judge. The ruling of the Judge on any objection shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the Judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon proper motion, the Judge may accept direct testimony submitted pursuant to § 1.807 into evidence without a witness reading the direct testimony into evidence. Such direct testimony shall become a part of the record subject to exclusion of irrelevant and immaterial parts thereof. A party shall be deemed to have waived the right to introduce pre-hearing written direct testimony and documents if such party fails to present a witness to introduce those documents. The witness introducing direct testimony and documents shall do so under oath or affirmation and shall:</P>
            <P>(i) State his or her name, address and occupation.</P>
            <P>(ii) State qualifications for introducing the direct testimony. If an expert, the witness shall briefly state the scientific or technical training which qualifies the witness as an expert.</P>
            <P>(iii) Identify the direct testimony and documents previously submitted pursuant to § 1.807 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(iv) Submit to direct and cross examination determined to be necessary and appropriate by the Judge.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Cross examination.</E> For purposes of this section, the Administrator's or his or her representative's interest shall be considered adverse to all parties. The Judge may:</P>
            <P>(i) Require the cross-examiner to outline the intended scope of the cross examination, which shall generally be limited to the scope of the direct testimony.</P>
            <P>(ii) Prohibit parties from cross-examining witnesses unless the Judge has determined that the cross-examiner has an adverse interest on the facts at issue to the party or witness.</P>
            <P>(iii) Limit the number of times any party or parties having a common interest may cross-examine an adverse witness on the same matter.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Proof and authentication of official records or documents.</E> An official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible as evidence without the presence of the person who made or prepared the same. The Judge shall exercise discretion in determining whether an official publication of such record or document shall be necessary, or whether a copy would be permissible. If permissible such a copy shall be attested to by the person having legal custody of it, and accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> (i) All written statements, documents, charts, tabulations, or data offered into evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the witness or his or her counsel or representative and upon satisfactory showing of authenticity, relevancy, and materiality, be numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the record.</P>
            <P>(ii) Such exhibits shall be submitted in quadruplicate and in documentary form.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> (i) Subject to paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, official notice at the hearing may be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character.</P>
            <P>(ii) Interested persons shall be given an adequate period of time, at the hearing or subsequent to it, of matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> (i) Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript.</P>
            <P>(ii) The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be inserted into the transcript; if the evidence consists of an exhibit(s), it shall be inserted into the record for the purpose of an offer of proof. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the record if the Secretary determines that the Judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous.</P>

            <P>(iii) The Judge shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a <PRTPAGE P="127"/>considerable length of time at the hearing. In such event, if the Secretary determines that the Judge erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing may be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.</P>

          <SUBJECT>To what does this policy apply?</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Except as detailed in § 1c.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research <PRTPAGE P="133"/>conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.</P>
          <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>

          <P>(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.</P>
          <P>(e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
          <P>(f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
          <P>(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.</P>

          <P>(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.</P>
          <P>(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>63</SU>

            <FTREF/> Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, <PRTPAGE P="137"/>with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 1c.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 1c.103(d)).</P>
          <P>(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</P>
          <P>(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.</P>
          <P>(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 1c.101(i) or exempted under § 1c.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.</P>

Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.</P>
          <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>
          <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>
          <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 1c.111(a)(7).</P>
          <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 1c.111(a)(7).</P>
          <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>

          <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to <PRTPAGE P="139"/>participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>
          <P>(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;</P>
          <P>(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;</P>
          <P>(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or</P>

          <P>(iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

          <P>(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:</P>
          <P>(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;</P>
          <P>(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 1c.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).</P>
          <P>(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 1c.108(b).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
          <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
          <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

          <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>
          <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted.

          <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 1c.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>

          <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 1c.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 1c.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral <PRTPAGE P="149"/>presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>
          <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
          <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>
          <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
          <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

            <P>The Department of Agriculture was created by the Act of May 15, 1862, and by the Act of February 9, 1889, it was made an executive department in the Federal Government under the supervision and control of the Secretary of Agriculture (7 U.S.C. 2201, 2202, 2204).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The general authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations governing the work of the Department is based on 5 U.S.C. 301 which provides that the head of an Executive department may prescribe regulations for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use and preservation of its records, papers, and property.</P>

            <P>(a) The general authority of the Secretary to make delegations of his authority is based on:</P>
            <P>(1) Section 4(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 (5 U.S.C. App.), which provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by an agency or employee, of the Department of Agriculture of any function of the Secretary, including any function transferred to the Secretary by the provisions of this reorganization plan; and</P>
            <P>(2) Section 212(a)(1) of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-354, 7 U.S.C. 6912(a)(1), which provides that the Secretary may delegate to any agency, office, officer, or employee of the Department the authority to perform any function transferred to the Secretary under 7 U.S.C. 6912(a) or any other function vested in the Secretary as of the date of the enactment of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Demand Letters.</E> Generally, debt collection is initiated with a written demand for payment to the debtor unless an applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement) provides otherwise (such as providing USDA an immediate right to collect upon delinquency). Written demand as described in paragraph (b) of this section shall be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms that inform the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with the agency to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, and number of demand letters shall depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to the agency's letters or telephone calls. Where statutes or agency regulations are specific as to the requirements for demand letters, an agency shall follow its own procedures in formulating demand letters. Generally, one demand letter should suffice. In determining the timing of the demand letter(s), an agency shall give due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to Justice for litigation, in accordance with 31 CFR 904.1 or otherwise. When necessary to protect the government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this part, including immediate referral for litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Required notices.</E> In demand letters, the USDA creditor agency shall inform the debtor:</P>
            <P>(1) The nature and amount of the debt; and the facts giving rise to the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) How interest, penalties, and administrative costs are added to the debt, the date by which payment must be made to avoid such charges, and that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with § 3.17;</P>
            <P>(3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid the enforced collection actions described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section;</P>

            <P>(4) The willingness of the creditor agency to discuss alternative payment arrangements and how the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the debt under terms acceptable to the agency (<E T="03">see</E> § 3.16);</P>
            <P>(5) The name, address, telephone number and email address (optional) of a contact person or office within the creditor agency;</P>
            <P>(6) The intention of the creditor agency to enforce collection if the debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more of the following actions:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Offset.</E> Offset the debtor's USDA payments and refer the debtor's debt to TOP for offset against other Federal payments, including income tax refunds, in accordance with subpart D;<PRTPAGE P="321"/>

            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Administrative wage garnishment.</E> Refer the debt to Treasury in accordance with subpart E for possible collection by garnishing the debtor's wages through administrative wage garnishment;</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Litigation.</E> Refer the debt to Justice in accordance with § 3.21 to initiate litigation to collect the debt;</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Referral to Treasury.</E> Referral of the debt to Treasury for collection in accordance with subpart C of this part;</P>
            <P>(7) That USDA debts over 180 days delinquent must be referred to Treasury for the collection actions described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section;</P>
            <P>(8) How the debtor may inspect and copy records related to the debt;</P>

            <P>(9) How the debtor may request a review of the USDA creditor agency's determination that the debtor owes a debt and present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable (<E T="03">see</E> subpart F of this part);</P>

            <P>(d) Agencies shall exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day that they are dated. There is no prescribed format for demand letters. Agencies shall utilize demand letters and procedures that will lead to the earliest practicable determination of whether the debt can be resolved administratively or must be referred for litigation.</P>
            <P>(e) Agencies shall respond promptly to communications from debtors, within 30 days of receipt whenever feasible, and shall advise debtors who dispute debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.</P>

            <P>(f) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time during or after completion of the demand process, if an agency determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, internal administrative offset, the procedures applicable to offset must be followed (<E T="03">see</E> subpart D). The availability of funds or money for debt satisfaction by internal administrative offset, and the agency's determination to pursue collection by internal administrative offset, shall release the agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation under 31 CFR part 904, agencies shall advise each debtor determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt can be collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This notification shall comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., pp. 157-163) and may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (b) of this section or in a separate document. Litigation counsel for the government shall be advised that this notice has been given.</P>

            <P>(h) When an agency learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, the agency shall immediately seek legal <PRTPAGE P="322"/>advice from OGC concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or contemplated collection activities. Unless the agency is advised that the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection activity against the debtor must stop immediately. The agency should take the following steps:</P>
            <P>(1) After seeking legal advice, a proof of claim must be filed in most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. Agencies shall refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.</P>
            <P>(2) If the agency is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.</P>
            <P>(3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, agencies may seek legal advice from OGC to determine whether their payments to the debtor and payments of other agencies available for offset may be frozen by the agency until relief from the automatic stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. Agencies also may seek legal advice from OGC to determine whether recoupment is available.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guarantees, licenses, permits, or privileges.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Agencies are not permitted to extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a nontax debt owed to a Federal agency, except as otherwise authorized by law or upon waiver of application of this section by the USDA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Deputy CFO. This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. Agencies may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. The Secretary of the Treasury may exempt classes of debts from this prohibition and has prescribed standards defining when a “delinquency” is “resolved” for purposes of this prohibition. <E T="03">See</E> 31 CFR 285.13 (Barring Delinquent Debtors From Obtaining Federal Loans or Loan Insurance or Guarantees).</P>

            <P>(b) Similarly, agencies also are not permitted to extend financial assistance (either directly or indirectly) in the form of grants, loans, or loan guarantees to judgment debtors who have a judgment lien placed against their property until the judgment is satisfied, unless the agency grants a waiver in accordance with agency regulations. <E T="03">See</E> 31 U.S.C. 3201(e).<PRTPAGE P="323"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) In non-bankruptcy cases, agencies seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims must consider the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or other privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay such a debt in accordance with the agency's regulations or governing procedures. The debtor shall be advised in the agency's written demand for payment of the agency's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges.</P>

            <P>(d) Any agency making, guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in, loans must consider suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, or broker from doing further business with the agency or engaging in programs sponsored by the agency if such lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the government within a reasonable time or if such lender, contractor, or broker has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program or activity by another Federal agency. Failure to pay a single substantial debt, or a number of outstanding debts (including disallowed costs and overrun payments, but not including sums owed to the government under the Internal Revenue Code) owed to any Federal agency or instrumentality is grounds for nonprocurement suspension or debarment if the debt is uncontested and the debtor's legal administrative remedies for review of the debt are exhausted. <E T="03">See</E> 7 CFR 3017.305(c)(3) and 405(a)(2).</P>
            <P>(e) The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 shall be reported to Treasury. Treasury will forward to all interested agencies notification that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the government has been revoked.</P>
            <P>(f) The suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or privileges also may extend to USDA programs or activities that are administered by the States on behalf of the government, to the extent that they affect the government's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors. Therefore, States that manage USDA activities, pursuant to approval from the agencies, shall ensure that appropriate steps are taken to safeguard against issuing licenses, permits, or privileges to debtors who fail to pay their debts to the government.</P>
            <P>(e) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of an agency's intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, agencies may seek legal advice from OGC concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.</P>

            <P>(a) In accordance with applicable statutes and regulations, agencies may liquidate security or collateral through a sale or a nonjudicial foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the debtor fails to pay the debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is in the best interest of the United States. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.</P>
            <P>(b) When an agency learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the agency may seek legal advice from OGC concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, agencies may accept payment in regular installments. Agencies shall obtain financial statements from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify such representations whenever possible (<E T="03">see</E> 31 CFR 902.2(g) for methods of verification). Agencies that agree to accept payments in regular installments shall obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all terms of the arrangement and that contains a <PRTPAGE P="324"/>provision accelerating the debt in the event of default.</P>
            <P>(b) The size and frequency of installment payments shall bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If possible, the installment payments shall be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.</P>
            <P>(c) Security for deferred payments shall be obtained in appropriate cases. Agencies may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security, at the agency's option.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section, agencies shall charge interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. If not included in the agency's demand notice, an agency shall mail or hand-deliver a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's most recent address available to the agency, explaining the agency's requirements concerning these charges except where these requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These charges shall continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.</P>
            <P>(b) Agencies shall charge interest on debts owed the United States as follows, except as otherwise required by law:</P>
            <P>(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of delinquency, or as otherwise provided by law.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest charged shall be the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, an agency may charge a higher rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. The agency must document the reason(s) for its determination that the higher rate is necessary.</P>
            <P>(3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the agency may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest shall not be compounded, that is, interest shall not be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. If, however, a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) Agencies shall assess administrative costs incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of administrative costs shall be based on actual costs incurred or upon estimated costs as determined by the assessing agency.</P>
            <P>(d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, agencies shall charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), not to exceed six percent a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge shall accrue from the date of delinquency.</P>

            <P>(e) Agencies may increase an “administrative debt” by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. “Administrative debt” includes, but is not limited to, a debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt based on the extension of government credit, such as those arising from loans and loan guarantees. The cost of living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts shall be computed annually. Agencies may use this alternative only when there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of the debt.<PRTPAGE P="325"/>
            </P>
            <P>(f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalties, second to administrative charges, third to interest, and last to principal, except as otherwise required by law.</P>

            <P>(g) Agencies shall waive the collection of interest and administrative charges imposed pursuant to this section (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, this does not apply to interest or administrative penalties determined by an applicable agreement or instrument such as a loan contract) on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. Agencies may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis. In addition, agencies may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set forth in the Federal standards for the compromise of debts (31 CFR part 902), or if the agency determines that collection of these charges is against equity and good conscience or is not in the best interest of the United States.</P>
            <P>(h) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(i) Agencies are authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common law. Agencies shall consult OGC before imposing interest and related charges under common law for any debt.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Agencies are required by law to transfer delinquent, nontax, legally enforceable debts to Treasury for collection through cross-servicing and through centralized administrative offset. Additionally, USDA has chosen to transfer debts to Treasury for collection through administrative wage garnishment. Agencies need not make duplicate referrals to Treasury for all these purposes; a debt may be referred simultaneously for purposes of collection by cross-servicing, centralized administrative offset, and administrative wage garnishment where applicable. However, in some instances a debt exempt from collection via cross-servicing may be subject to collection by <PRTPAGE P="326"/>centralized administrative offset so simultaneous referrals are not always the norm. This subpart sets forth rules applicable to the transfer of debts to Treasury for collection by cross-servicing. Rules for transfer to Treasury for centralized administrative offset are set forth in subpart D, and for administrative wage garnishment in subpart E.</P>
            <P>(b) When debts are referred or transferred to Treasury, or Treasury-designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), Treasury shall service, collect, or compromise the debts, or Treasury will suspend or terminate the collection action, in accordance with the statutory requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 3.31</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Mandatory referral for cross-servicing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Agencies shall transfer to Treasury any legally enforceable nontax debt in excess of $25, or combination of debts less than $25 that exceeds $25 (in the case of a debtor whose taxpayer identification number (TIN) is unknown the applicable threshold is $100), that has or have been delinquent for a period of 180 days in accordance with 31 CFR 285.12 so that Treasury may take appropriate action on behalf of the creditor agency to collect or compromise, or to suspend or terminate collection, of the debt, including use of debt collection centers and private collection contractors to collect the debt or terminate collection action.</P>
            <P>(b) The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any debt that:</P>
            <P>(1) Is in litigation or foreclosure (<E T="03">see</E> 31 CFR 385.12 (d)(2) for definition);</P>

            <P>(2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program (<E T="03">see</E> 31 CFR 285.12(d)(3)(i) for definition);</P>
            <P>(3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to Treasury;</P>
            <P>(4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable to Treasury;</P>
            <P>(5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent;</P>
            <P>(6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best interest of the United States. Federal agencies may request that the Secretary of the Treasury exempt specific classes of debts. Any such request by an agency must be sent to the Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury by the USDA CFO.</P>
            <P>(c) A debt is considered 180 days delinquent for purposes of this section if it is 180 days past due and is legally enforceable. A debt is past due if it has not been paid by the date specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement) unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made. A debt is legally enforceable if there has been a final agency determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due and there are no legal bars to collection action. Where, for example, a debt is the subject of a pending administrative review process required by statute or regulation and collection action during the review process is prohibited, the debt is not considered legally enforceable for purposes of mandatory transfer to Treasury and is not to be transferred even if the debt is more than 180 days past due. When a final agency determination is made after an administrative appeal or review process (including administrative review under subpart F), the creditor agency must transfer such debt to Treasury, if more than 180 days delinquent, within 30 days after the date of the final decision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for notification of intent to collect by administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Prior to initiation of collection by administrative offset, a creditor agency must:</P>

            <P>(1) Send the debtor a written Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset, by mail or hand-delivery, of the type and amount of the debt, the intention of the agency to use non-centralized administrative offset (which includes a USDA internal administrative offset) to collect the debt 30 days after the date of the Notice, the name of the Federal agency or USDA agency from which the creditor agency wishes to collect in the case of a non-centralized administrative offset, the intent to refer the debt to Treasury for collection through centralized administrative offset (including possible offset of tax refunds) 60 days after the date of <PRTPAGE P="328"/>the Notice if the debt is not satisfied by offset within USDA or by agreement with another Federal agency, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716; and</P>
            <P>(2) Give the debtor the opportunity:</P>
            <P>(i) To inspect and copy agency records related to the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) For a review within the agency of the determination of indebtedness in accordance with subpart F; and</P>
            <P>(iii) To make a written agreement to repay the debt.</P>
            <P>(b) The procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are not required when:</P>
            <P>(1) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;</P>
            <P>(2) The debt arises under a contract subject to the Contracts Disputes Act;</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of a non-centralized administrative offset, the agency first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, the agency shall give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the government; or</P>

            <P>(4) The agency previously has given a debtor any of the notice and review opportunities required under this part, with respect to a particular debt (<E T="03">see, e.g.</E>, § 3.11). With respect to loans paid on an installment basis, notice and opportunity to review under this part may only be provided once for the life of the loan upon the occurrence of the first delinquent installment. Subsequently, if an agency elects this option, credit reporting agencies may be furnished periodically with updates as to the current or delinquent status of the loan account and the borrower may receive notice of referral to TOP for delinquent installments without further opportunity for review. Any interest accrued or any installments coming due after the offset is initiated also would not require a new notice and opportunity to review.</P>
            <P>(c) The Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset shall be included as part of a demand letter issued under § 3.11 to advise the debtor of all debt collection possibilities that the agency will seek to employ.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 3.42</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Debtor rights to inspect or copy records, submit repayment proposals, or request administrative review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A debtor who intends to inspect or copy agency or USDA records with respect to the debt must notify the creditor agency in writing within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset. In response, the agency must notify the debtor of the location, time, and any other conditions, consistent with part 1, subpart A, of this title, for inspecting and copying, and that the debtor may be liable for reasonable copying expenses. A decision by the agency under this paragraph shall not be subject to review under subpart F or by NAD under 7 CFR part 11.</P>
            <P>(b) The debtor may, in response to the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset, propose to the creditor agency a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to administrative offset. Any debtor who wishes to do this must submit a written proposal for repayment of the debt, which must be received by the creditor agency within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset or 15 days after the date of a decision adverse to the debtor under subpart F. In response, the creditor agency must notify the debtor in writing whether the proposed agreement is acceptable. In exercising its discretion, the creditor agency must balance the government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor. A decision by the agency under this paragraph shall not be subject to review under subpart F or by NAD under 7 CFR part 11.</P>

            <P>(c) A debtor must request an administrative review of the debt under subpart F within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset for purposes of a proposed collection by non-centralized administrative offset and within 60 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset for <PRTPAGE P="329"/>purposes of a proposed collection by referral to Treasury for offset against other Federal payments that would include tax refunds.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Non-centralized administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> In cooperation with the Federal agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor, a creditor agency may make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt from, for example, a Federal employee's lump sum payment upon leaving government service in order to pay an unpaid advance. Also, non-centralized administrative offsets include USDA internal administrative offsets, for example, of CCC payments to pay Farm Service Agency (FSA) delinquent debts. Unless prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable nontax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effectuation of offset.</E> A non-centralized administrative offset may be effected 31 days after the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset, any time after the final determination in an administrative review conducted under subpart F upholds the creditor agency's decision to offset, or any time after the creditor agency notifies the debtor that its repayment proposal submitted under § 3.42(c) is not acceptable if the 30-day period for the debtor to seek review of the Notice has expired, unless the creditor agency makes a determination under § 3.41(b)(3) that immediate action to effectuate the offset is necessary.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification.</E> A payment authorizing agency may conduct a non-centralized administrative offset only after certification by a creditor agency that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor has been provided notice and opportunity for review as set forth in § 3.41; and</P>
            <P>(2) The payment authorizing agency has received written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor agency has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibilities of payment authorizing agencies.</E> Payment authorizing agencies shall comply with offset requests by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to the program of the payment authorizing agency, or would otherwise be contrary to law. Appropriate use should be made of the cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Application of recovered amounts to satisfaction of debts.</E> When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, agencies shall apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Centralized administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Mandatory referral.</E> After the notice and review opportunity requirements of § 3.41 are met, an agency shall refer debts which are over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for collection through centralized administrative offset 61 days after the date of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset provided in accordance with § 3.41. If the debtor seeks review under subpart F, referral of the debt must occur within 30 days of the final decision upholding the agency decision to offset the debt if the debt is more than 180 days delinquent.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Discretionary referral.</E> After the notice and review opportunity requirements of § 3.41 are met, and administrative review under subpart F is not sought or is unsuccessful on the part of the debtor, an agency may refer a debt that is less than 180 days delinquent.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for referral.</E> Agencies shall refer debts to Treasury for collection in accordance with Treasury procedures set forth in 31 CFR part 285.5.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment authorizing agency responsibilities.</E> (1) The names and TINs of debtors who owe debts referred to Treasury under this section shall be compared to the names and TINs on <PRTPAGE P="330"/>payments to be made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials include disbursing officials of Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other government corporations, and disbursing officials of the United States designated by Treasury. When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment authorizing agency must offset a payment to satisfy the debt.</P>
            <P>(2) Any USDA official serving as a Federal disbursing official for purposes of effecting centralized administrative offset under this section must notify a debtor/payee in writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice must include the information set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) As described in 31 CFR 285.5(g)(1) and (2), any USDA official serving as a Federal disbursing official for purposes of centralized administrative offset under this section shall furnish a warning notice to a payee/debtor prior to beginning offset of recurring payments. Such warning notice shall include the information set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) The notice shall include a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within the creditor agency who will respond to questions regarding the offset.</P>
            <P>(5) The priorities for collecting multiple payments owed by a payee/debtor shall be those set forth in 31 CFR 285.5(f)(3).</P>

            <P>(a) A USDA payment authorizing agency, to satisfy either a non-centralized or centralized administrative offset under §§ 3.43 and 3.44, may offset:</P>
            <P>(1) A debtor's pro rata share of USDA payments due any entity in which the debtor participates, either directly or indirectly, as determined by the creditor agency or the payment authorizing agency; or</P>
            <P>(2) USDA payments due any entity that the debtor has established, or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other manner the operation of, for the purpose of avoiding payment on the claim or debt, as determined by the creditor agency or the payment authorizing agency.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to exercising the authority of this section to offset any portion of a payment due an entity, the creditor agency must have provided notice to that entity in accordance with § 3.41 of its intent to offset payments to the entity in satisfaction of the debt of an individual debtor participating in that entity.</P>

            <P>Upon providing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in § 3.41, creditor agencies may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in § 3.40(e).</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Employer</E> means a person or entity that employs the services of others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer includes, but is not limited to, State and local governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal government.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) USDA has determined to pursue administrative wage garnishment of USDA debtors by referral of nontax legally enforceable debts to Treasury for issuance of garnishment orders by Treasury or its contractors.</P>
            <P>(b) Pursuant to § 3.11, agencies must notify debtors of their intent to pursue garnishment of their disposable pay through referral of the debt to Treasury for issuance of an administrative wage garnishment order and provide debtors with the opportunity for review of the existence of the debt under subpart F within 60 days of the date of the demand letter.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon expiration of the 60-day period for review, or upon completion of a review under subpart F that upholds the agency's determination of the debt, USDA will transfer the debt for collection through administrative wage garnishment as well as other means through cross-servicing or centralized administrative offset.</P>

            <P>(d) If Treasury elects to pursue collection through administrative wage garnishment, Treasury, or its contractor, will notify the debtor of its intent to initiate garnishment proceedings and provide the debtor with the opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt, enter into a repayment agreement, or request a hearing as to the existence or <PRTPAGE P="332"/>amount of the debt or the terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the proposed garnishment order, in accordance with 31 CFR 285.11.</P>

A hearing or review under this section shall satisfy the required opportunity for administrative review by the agency of the determination of a debt for both administrative offset and administrative wage garnishment that is required before transfer to Treasury for collection or collection by the agency through non-centralized administrative offset.</P>

            <P>An agency reviewing officer may be an agency employee, or the agency may provide for reviews to be done by another agency through an interagency agreement. No agency employee may act as a reviewing officer for the consideration of collection by administrative offset in a matter for which the employee was a contracting officer or a debt management officer.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 3.62</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset, Notice of Disclosure to Credit Reporting Agencies, or Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Wage Garnishment, or more than one of the above simultaneously, may request administrative review of the agency's determination that the debt exists and the amount of the debt. Any debtor who wishes to do this must submit a written explanation of why the debtor disagrees and seeks review. The request must be received by the creditor agency within 60 days of the date of the notice in the case of a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset that includes referral to Treasury for offset against other Federal payments including tax refunds and 30 days in the case of all other notices.</P>

            <P>(b) In response, the creditor agency must notify the debtor in writing whether the review will be by documentary review or by hearing. An oral hearing is not necessary with respect to debt collection systems in which a determination of indebtedness rarely involves issues of credibility or veracity and the agency has determined that review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes. The agency shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the agency determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when <PRTPAGE P="333"/>the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. If the debtor requests a hearing, and the creditor agency decides to conduct a documentary review, the agency must notify the debtor of the reason why a hearing will not be granted. The agency must also advise the debtor of the procedures to be used in reviewing the documentary record, or of the date, location and procedures to be used if review is by a hearing.</P>
            <P>(c) An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.</P>
            <P>(d) After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the debtor of:</P>
            <P>(1) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;</P>
            <P>(2) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or</P>
            <P>(3) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a documentary review.</P>
            <P>(e) Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the debtor and the agency, evidenced in writing, any documentary review or hearing will be conducted not less than 10 days and no more than 45 days after receipt of the request for review.</P>
            <P>(f) Unless otherwise arranged by mutual agreement between the debtor and the agency, evidenced in writing, a documentary review or hearing will be based on agency records plus other relevant documentary evidence which may be submitted by the debtor within 10 days after the request for review is received.</P>
            <P>(g)(1) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> Hearings will be as informal as possible, and will be conducted by a reviewing officer in a fair and expeditious manner. The reviewing officer need not use the formal rules of evidence with regard to the admissibility of evidence or the use of evidence once admitted. However, clearly irrelevant material should not be admitted, whether or not any party objects. Any party to the hearing may offer exhibits, such as copies of financial records, telephone memoranda, or agreements, provided the opposing party is notified at least five days before the hearing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The provisions of this subpart set forth USDA procedures for the collection of a Federal employee's pay by salary offset to satisfy certain valid and past due debts owed the government.</P>

            <P>(1) Current USDA employees and employees of other agencies who owe debts to USDA; and</P>
            <P>(2) Current USDA employees who owe debts to other agencies.</P>
            <P>(c) These regulations do not apply to debts owed by FSA county executive directors or county office employees. Salaries of those employees are subject to administrative offset as provided in 7 CFR part 792 or part 1403.</P>

            <P>(d) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g. travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 or employee training expense in 5 U.S.C. 4108).</P>
            <P>(e) These regulations identify the types of salary offset available to USDA, as well as certain rights provided to the employee, which include a written notice before deductions begin and the opportunity to petition for a hearing and to receive a written decision if a hearing is granted. The rights provided by this section do not extend to:</P>
            <P>(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less;</P>
            <P>(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.</P>
            <P>(f) These regulations do not preclude an employee from:</P>
            <P>(1) Requesting waiver of an erroneous overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716;</P>
            <P>(2) Requesting waiver of any other type of debt, if waiver is available by statute; or</P>
            <P>(3) Questioning the amount or validity of a debt, in the manner prescribed by this part.</P>
            <P>(g) Nothing in these regulations precludes the compromise, suspension or termination of collection actions where appropriate under USDA regulations contained elsewhere.</P>

Any employee who wishes to do this must <PRTPAGE P="338"/>submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt that is received by USDA within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Intent to Offset Salary or 15 days after the date of a hearing decision issued under § 3.78.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">USDA response.</E> USDA will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. USDA may accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, USDA will balance the USDA interest in collecting the debt against hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has not disputed its existence or amount, USDA will accept a repayment agreement, instead of offset, for good cause such as, if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</P>

            <P>(b) If the employee filed a petition for a hearing with USDA before the expiration of the period provided for in § 3.75, then deductions will begin after the hearing officer has provided the employee with a hearing, and a final written decision has been rendered in favor of USDA.</P>
            <P>(c) If an employee retires or resigns before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will be collected according to the procedures for administrative offset (see subpart D of this part).</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or $50 a month will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sources of deductions.</E> USDA will make deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.</P>

          <P>(a) The parity index and related indices for the purpose of calculating parity prices after May 1, 1976, according to the formula contained in section 301(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended by the Agricultural Acts of 1948, 1949, 1954, and 1956 (hereinafter referred to as section 301(a)) shall be the index of prices paid by farmers, interest, taxes, and farm wage rates, as revised May 1976 and published in the May 28, 1976, and subsequent issues of the monthly report, “Agricultural Prices.” The publication of these indices by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in the monthly report, “Agricultural Prices”, shall be continued.</P>
          <P>(b) The measure of the general level of prices received by farmers as provided for in section 301(a)(1)(B)(ii) after January 1, 1959, shall be the index of prices received by farmers as revised January 1959 and published in the January 30, 1959, and subsequent issues of “Agricultural Prices”. The simple average of the 120 monthly indices included in the preceding 10 calendar years plus an adjustment to take account of the effect on the index of any adjustment made on average prices of individual commodities as hereinafter specified shall be used in the calculation of the adjusted base prices. Parity prices heretofore published for periods prior to January 1, 1959 shall not be revised.</P>
          <P>(c) The term <E T="03">milkfat</E> as used in these regulations is synonymous with the term <E T="03">butterfat,</E> and when any statute requires calculation of the parity price of butterfat, the parity price of milkfat shall be the parity price of butterfat.</P>

          <P>It is hereby found that it is impractical to use averages of prices received by farmers on a calendar year basis for the following agricultural commodities for the purpose of calculating adjusted base prices and, therefore, marketing season average prices will be used. An allowance for any supplemental payment resulting from price support operations shall be included in the determination of the adjusted base prices. For cigar binder tobacco, types 51-52, for each of the marketing seasons beginning in the years 1949 through 1958, 37.9 cents per pound shall be used in lieu of the average of prices received by farmers for such tobacco during each such marketing season.</P>

          <P>(a) New adjusted base prices for all of the commodities on a calendar year basis and for as many of the commodities on a marketing season average basis as are practicable shall be published on or about January 31 of each year. In cases where preliminary marketing season average price data are used in estimating the adjusted base prices published in January, any additional price data which becomes available shall be used in estimating a revised adjusted base price which shall be published prior to the beginning of the marketing season for the commodity.</P>
          <P>(b) The official parity prices determined under section 301(a)(1) and the regulations in this part and the indexes and relevant price data shall be published in the monthly report “Agricultural Prices” issued by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Parity prices for all commodities for which parity prices are computed shall be so published in the January and July issues each year. The parity prices published in other issues may be restricted to those which the National Agricultural Statistics Service, after consultation with the Agricultural Marketing Service, the Farm Service Agency, and any other interested government agency, considers necessary or desirable. The parity prices determined in accordance with this part shall be the parity prices used in other reports, determinations, or documents of the Department.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Revision of the parity price of a commodity.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Initiation of hearings.</E> The “modernized” parity formula specified in section 301(a)(1) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, takes into consideration the average prices received by farmers for agricultural commodities during the last ten years and is designed gradually to adjust relative parity prices of specific commodities for persistent or continuing changes in demand and supply conditions which are reflected in market prices. Accordingly, only in rare cases is it possible for the parity price of any agricultural commodity to become seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities. In any case, however, in which producers of any agricultural commodity believe that the parity price of such commodity, as computed pursuant to the provisions of section 301(a)(1), is seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, a request for a public hearing under section 301(a)(1)(F) may be submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture by a substantial number of interested producers. The producers shall also furnish to the Secretary, with such request or separately, data supporting their conclusion that the parity price of such commodity is seriously out of line with the parity prices of other commodities. Upon receipt of such a request with supporting data, or at any time upon the Secretary's own motion, this Department will make a preliminary study of the relationship between the parity price of such commodity and the parity prices of other commodities, and if the Secretary concludes that there appears to be reasonable grounds for believing that the parity price of such commodity is seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, a hearing will be held pursuant to the provisions of section 301(a)(1)(F).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of hearing.</E> If the Secretary of Agriculture determines that such a hearing shall be held, he shall issue a notice of the hearing, which shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the United States Department of Agriculture, who shall promptly (1) cause such notice to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and (2) mail a copy thereof to each of the producers who requested the hearing and to grower organizations known to be interested in the hearing. Legal notice of the hearing shall be deemed to be given upon filing such notice with the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for publication, and failure to give notice in the manner otherwise provided in this paragraph shall not affect the legality of the notice. The notice of hearing shall state the purpose of the hearing and the time and place of the hearing. The time of the hearing shall not be less than fifteen days after <PRTPAGE P="350"/>the date of publication of the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> unless the Secretary shall determine that an emergency exists which requires a shorter period of notice, in which case the period of notice shall be that which the Secretary determines to be reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Conduct of hearing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Presiding officer.</E> Each hearing held under section 301(a)(1)(F) shall be presided over by a Hearing Examiner of the Office of Administrative Law Judges or such other employee of the Department as the Secretary may designate for the purpose.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Each hearing shall be heard at the time and place set forth in the notice of hearing but may be continued by the presiding officer from day to day or adjourned to a later date or to a different place without notice other than the announcement thereof at the hearing.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Order of procedure.</E> At the commencement of the hearing, the presiding officer shall file as an exhibit a copy of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> containing the notice of the hearing and shall then outline briefly the procedure to be followed. Evidence shall then be received from interested persons in such order as the presiding officer shall prescribe.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Submission of evidence.</E> The hearing shall be conducted in such a way as to obtain a clear and orderly record. All interested persons appearing at the hearing shall be given reasonable opportunity to offer data, views, or arguments relevant to (i) whether the parity price for the agricultural commodity involved is or is not seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, and (ii) the proper relationship between the parity price of such commodity and the parity prices of other agricultural commodities and the revisions, if any, which should be made in computing the parity price of such commodity. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted in duplicate. The presiding officer shall, insofar as possible, exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but shall not apply technical judicial rules of evidence. Every witness shall be subject to questioning by the presiding officer or by any other representative of the Department, but cross-examination by other persons shall not be allowed, except in the discretion of the presiding officer. The proceedings at the hearing shall be transcribed verbatim.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Written arguments.</E> The presiding officer shall fix a time, not to exceed ten days from the close of the hearing, within which interested persons may file written arguments with the Hearing Clerk.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Preparation and issuance of determination</E>—(1) <E T="03">Preparation of recommendation.</E> As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing, the presiding officer, or such employees of the Department as may be assigned for the purpose, shall review, consider, and weigh all evidence of probative value, views, and arguments which have been submitted, and may consider other pertinent information and data which is available in the Department of Agriculture, and shall submit a recommendation thereon to the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination by the Secretary.</E> As soon as possible after receipt of the recommendation, the Secretary shall determine whether the parity price of such commodity computed in accordance with section 301(a)(1) appears to be seriously out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities whether the facts require a revision of the method of computing the parity price of such commodity, and the revision, if any, which is required in the method of computing the parity price of such commodity. Such determination by the Secretary shall be final. The Secretary's determination shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk who shall cause the determination to be published promptly in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Hearing Clerk shall also mail a copy of the determination to each producer and grower organization which participated in or is known to be interested in the hearing. Upon application to the Hearing Clerk, any person shall be entitled to a copy of the determination.</P>

The Administrator shall expedite to the fullest practicable extent his attention to requests for emergency treatment under section 8(a), and such requests shall receive priority over requests for other action under section 22. The investigation shall cover (1) whether the commodity is a perishable agricultural commodity; (2) whether, due to the perishability of the commodity, a condition exists requiring emergency treatment as indicated by such factors as (i) the marketing season for the commodity, (ii) past and prospective domestic production, stocks, requirements, and prices, (iii) past and prospective imports; and (3) such other matters as the Administrator determines are relevant to a determination as to whether emergency treatment for the commodity is necessary.

            <P>(a) Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States affecting the import regime for certain articles of dairy products. The Proclamation terminated quantitative restrictions that had been imposed pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural <PRTPAGE P="354"/>Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624); proclaimed tariff-rate quotas for such articles pursuant to Public Law 103-465; and specified which of such articles may be entered only by or for the account of a person to whom a license has been issued by the Secretary of Agriculture.</P>

            <P>(b) Effective January 1, 1995, the prior regime of absolute quotas for certain dairy products was replaced by a system of tariff-rate quotas. The articles subject to licensing under the tariff-rate quotas are listed in Appendices 1, 2, and 3 to be published annually in a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Licenses permit the holder to import specified quantities of the subject articles into the United States at the applicable in-quota rate of duty. If an importer has no license for an article subject to licensing, such importer will, with certain exceptions, be required to pay the applicable over-quota rate of duty.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that this subpart will, to the fullest extent practicable, result in fair and equitable allocation of the right to import articles subject to such tariff-rate quotas. The subpart will also maximize utilization of the tariff-rate quotas for such articles, taking due account of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the articles concerned.</P>

            <P>(2) Taking into account the order of preference expressed by each applicant, as required by § 6.24(c), the Licensing Authority will allocate licenses for an article from a country by a series of random draws. A license of minimum size will be issued to each applicant in the order established by such draws until the total amount of such article in Appendix 2 has been allocated. An applicant that receives a license for an article will be removed from the pool for subsequent draws until every applicant has been allocated at least one license, provided that the licenses for which they applied are not already fully allocated. Any amount remaining after the random draws which is less than the applicable minimum license size may, at the discretion of the licensing Authority, be prorated equally among the licenses awarded for that article.</P>

            <P>(ii) The amount, in kilograms, of such article for which each such importer is being designated. Where quantities for designation result from both Tokyo Round concessions and Uruguay Round concessions, the designations should be made in terms of each.</P>
            <P>(2) To the extent practicable, the Licensing Authority will issue designated licenses to those importers, and in those amounts, indicated by the government of the applicable country, provided that the importer designated meets the eligibility requirements set forth in § 6.23. Consistent with the international obligations of the United States, the Licensing Authority may disregard a designation if the Licensing Authority determines that the person designated is not eligible for any of the reasons set forth in § 6.23(c)(1) or (2).</P>
            <P>(3) If a government of a country which negotiated in the Uruguay Round for the right to designate importers has not done so, but determines to designate importers for the next quota year, it shall indicate its intention to do so directly and in writing to the Licensing Authority not later than July 1 prior to the beginning of such next quota year. Furthermore, if a government that has designated importers for a quota year determines that it will not continue to designate importers for the next quota year, it shall so indicate directly and in writing to the Licensing Authority, not later than July 1 prior to such next quota year.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Surrender and reallocation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If a licensee determines that it will not enter the entire amount of an article permitted under its license, such licensee shall surrender its license right to enter the amount that it does not intend to enter. Surrender shall be made to the Licensing Authority no later than October 1. Any surrender shall be final and shall be only for that quota year, except as provided in § 6.25(b). The amount of the license not surrendered shall be subject to the license use requirements of § 6.23(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(b) For each quota year, the Licensing Authority will, to the extent practicable, reallocate any amounts surrendered.</P>

            <P>(c) Any person who qualified for or was issued a cheese or cheese product license for a quota year may apply to receive additional license, or addition to an existing license for a portion of the amount being reallocated. A person who did not qualify for a cheese or cheese product license for a quota year, but qualified only for a license for articles other than cheese or cheese products, may only apply to receive an additional license for articles other than cheese or cheese products, or addition to an existing license for articles other than cheese or cheese products for a portion of the amount being reallocated. The application shall be submitted to the Licensing Authority no <PRTPAGE P="359"/>earlier than September 1 and not later than September 15, and shall specify:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and control number of the applicant;</P>

            <P>(3) If applicable, the number of the license issued to the applicant for that quota year permitting entry of the same article from the same country.</P>
            <P>(d) The Licensing Authority will reallocate surrendered amounts among applicants as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The minimum license size, or addition to an existing license, will be the total amount of the article from a country surrendered, or 10,000 kilograms, whichever is less;</P>
            <P>(2) Minimum size licenses, or additions to an existing license, will be allocated among applicants requesting articles on the basis of the rank-order lottery system described in § 6.25(c);</P>
            <P>(3) If there is any amount of an article from a country left after minimum size licenses have been issued, the Licensing Authority may allocate the remainder in any manner it determines equitable among applicants who have requested that article; and</P>
            <P>(4) No amount will be reallocated to a licensee who has surrendered a portion of its license for the same article from the same country during that quota year unless all other licensees applying for a reallocated quantity have been allocated a license;</P>
            <P>(e) However, if the government of an exporting country chooses to designate eligible importers for surrendered amounts under Appendix 3, the Licensing Authority shall issue the licenses in accordance with § 6.25(d)(2), provided that the government of the exporting country notifies the Licensing Authority of its designations no later than September 1. Such notification shall contain the names, addresses, and emails addresses of the importers that it is designating and the amount in kilograms of such article for which each importer is being designated. In such case the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply.</P>

In making such determination, the following shall apply:</P>
            <P>(1) The “domestic wholesale market” shall be one or more of the three major U.S. market areas, viz., New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco, and/or any other market area within the Customs Territory of the United States, which the Investigating Authority determines most representative of the area specified by the complainant as the one in which price-undercutting is alleged to be occurring (hereinafter referred to as “designated area”).</P>

            <P>(2) The “duty-paid wholesale price” determined by the Investigating Authority shall be the average of prices at which wholesalers have sold or offered for sale in the designated area the article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting, as obtained in a survey directed by the Investigating Authority during the investigation: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That whenever the designated area is not or does not include one of the major market areas specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Investigating Authority may adjust the average of prices determined for such designated area on the basis of the average of prices determined for the major market area which is determined to be the most representative of the designated area, taking into consideration any special factors which may be affecting prices in the designated area.</P>

            <P>(3) The “domestic wholesale market price” determined by the Investigating Authority for a similar article produced in the United States to that article of quota cheese which is alleged to be involved in price-undercutting shall be the average of prices at which wholesalers have sold the similar article produced in the United States in the designated area, as obtained in a survey directed by the Investigating Authority during the investigation: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That whenever the designated area is not or does not include one of the major market areas specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Investigating Authority may adjust the average of prices determined for such designated area on the basis of the average of prices determined for the major market area which is determined to be the most representative of <PRTPAGE P="364"/>the designated area, taking into consideration any special factors which may be affecting prices in the designated area.</P>
            <P>(4) “Similar article produced in the United States” shall be an article of cheese, cheese product, or imitation cheese produced in the United States and marketed in the domestic wholesale market, which is determined by the Investigating Authority, based upon available information to be most like the imported article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting, in terms of its physical properties and end use. In making this determination, first consideration shall be given to the normal end uses of the article produced in the United States in comparison with the end use of the article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting. If the end use of both articles is determined to be the same (e.g., processing or retail sale), the physical characteristics of the two articles shall be considered.</P>
            <FP>If the common end use of the two articles is processing, the representative samples of the two articles shall be examined in terms of processing quality, taking special note of processing yields. If the common end use of the two articles is retail sale, representative samples of the two articles shall be examined in terms of similarities of taste, texture, general appearance, quality, age, and packaging. Imported imitation quota cheese shall only be compared with imitation domestic cheese. If it is determined that the domestic cheese the price of which is claimed to be undercut is not similar to the quota cheese allegedly undercutting it, there shall be no finding of price-undercutting.</FP>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting determinations.</E> Determinations by the Secretary as to the validity of allegations of price-undercutting made under this subpart shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> not later than 5 days after the date the determination is made.</P>

When unanimously recommended by the members of the county committee, as constituted under this paragraph, and approved by the State committee, the offices of chairperson and vice chairperson of the county committee may be filled by any county committee member without regard to the order of succession specified in this paragraph.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Informal review of adverse decisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Required informal review of FSA adverse decisions.</E> Except with respect to farm credit programs, a participant must seek an informal review of an adverse decision issued at the field service office level by an officer or employee of FSA, or by any employee of a county or area committee established under section 8(b)(5) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, 16 U.S.C. 590h(b)(5), before NAD will accept an appeal of a FSA adverse decision. Such informal review shall be done by the county or area committee with responsibility for the adverse decision at issue. The procedures for requesting such an informal review before FSA are found in 7 CFR part 780. After receiving a decision upon review by a county or area committee, a participant may seek further informal review by the State FSA committee or may appeal directly to NAD under § 11.6(b).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Optional informal review.</E> With respect to adverse decisions issued at the State office level of FSA and adverse decisions of all other agencies, a participant may request an agency informal review of an adverse decision of that agency prior to appealing to NAD. Procedures for requesting such an informal review are found at 7 CFR part 780 (FSA), 7 CFR part 614 (NRCS), 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B (RUS), 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B (RBS), and 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B (RHS).</P>

If a participant:</P>
            <P>(1) Requests mediation or ADR prior to filing an appeal with NAD, the participant stops the running of the 30-day period during which a participant may appeal to NAD under § 11.6(b)(1), and will have the balance of days remaining in that period to appeal to NAD once mediation or ADR has concluded.</P>
            <P>(2) Requests mediation or ADR after having filed an appeal to NAD under § 11.6(b), but before the hearing, the participant will be deemed to have waived his right to have a hearing within 45 days under § 11.8(c)(1) but shall have a right to have a hearing within 45 days after conclusion of mediation or ADR.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Director review of agency determination of appealability and right of participants to Division hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Director review of agency determination of appealability.</E> (1) Not later than 30 days after the date on which a participant receives a determination from an agency that an agency decision is not appealable, the participant must submit a written request personally signed by the participant to the Director to review the determination in order to obtain such review by the Director.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director shall determined whether the decision is adverse to the individual participant and thus appealable or is a matter of general applicability and thus not subject to appeal, and will issue a final determination notice that upholds or reverses the determination of the agency. This final determination is not appealable. If the Director reverses the determination of the agency, the Director will notify the participant and the agency of that decision and inform the participant of his or her right to proceed with an appeal.</P>
            <P>(3) The Director may delegate his or her authority to conduct a review under this paragraph to any subordinate official of the Division other than a Hearing Officer. In any case in which such review is conducted by such a subordinate official, the subordinate official's determination shall be considered to be the determination of the Director and shall be final and not appealable.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeals of adverse decisions.</E> (1) To obtain a hearing under § 11.8, a participant personally must request such hearing not later than 30 days after the date on which the participant first received notice of the adverse decision or after the date on which the participant receives notice of the Director's determination that a decision is appealable. In the case of the failure of an agency to act on the request or right of a recipient, a participant personally must request such hearing not later than 30 days after the participant knew or reasonably should have known that the agency had not acted within the timeframes specified by agency program regulations, or, where such regulations specify no timeframes, not later than 30 days after the participant reasonably should have known of the agency's failure to act.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for a hearing shall be in writing and personally signed by the participant, and shall include a copy of the adverse decision to be reviewed, if available, along with a brief statement of the participant's reasons for believing that the decision, or the agency's failure to act, was wrong. The participant also shall send a copy of the request for a hearing to the agency, and may send a copy of the adverse decision to be reviewed to the agency, but failure to do either will not constitute grounds for dismissal of the appeal. Instead of a hearing, the participant may request a record review.</P>
            <P>(c) If a participant is represented by an authorized representative, the authorized representative must file a declaration with NAD, executed in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, stating that the participant has duly authorized the declarant in writing to represent the participant for purposes of a specified adverse decision or decisions, and attach a copy of the written authorization to the declaration.</P>

            <P>(ii) Discussions of the merits of the appeal where all parties to the appeal have been given notice and an opportunity to participate.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a communication described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a memorandum of any such discussion shall be included in the hearing record.</P>

            <P>(b) No interested person shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any officer or employee of the Division an <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication relevant to the merits of the appeal.</P>

            <P>(c) If any officer or employee of the Division receives an <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication in violation of this section, the one who receives the communication shall place in the hearing record:</P>
            <P>(1) All such written communications;</P>
            <P>(2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Division hearings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (1) The Director, the Hearing Officer, and the appellant shall have access to the agency record of any adverse decision appealed to the Division for a hearing. Upon request by the appellant, the agency shall provide the appellant a copy of the agency record.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director and Hearing Officer shall have the authority to administer oaths and affirmations, and to require, by subpoena, the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence. A Hearing Officer shall obtain the concurrence of the Director prior to issuing a subpoena.</P>
            <P>(i) A subpoena requiring the production of evidence may be requested and issued at any time while the case is pending before the Division.</P>
            <P>(ii) An appellant or an agency, acting through any appropriate official, may request the issuance of a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness by submitting such a request in writing at least 14 days before the scheduled date of a hearing. The Director or Hearing Officer shall issue a subpoena at least 7 days prior to the scheduled date of a hearing.</P>
            <P>(iii) A subpoena shall be issued only if the Director or a Hearing Officer determined that:</P>
            <P>(A) For a subpoena of documents, the appellant or the agency has established that production of documentary evidence is necessary and is reasonably calculated to lead to information which would affect the final determination or is necessary to fully present the case before the Division; or</P>
            <P>(B) For a subpoena of a witness, the appellant or the agency has established that either a representative of the Department or a private individual possesses information that is pertinent and necessary for disclosure of all relevant facts which could impact the final determination, that the information cannot be obtained except through testimony of the person, and that the testimony cannot be obtained absent issuance of a subpoena.</P>

            <P>(iv) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein may be made by registered or certified mail, or in person. Personal service shall be made by personal delivery of a copy of the subpoena to the person named therein by any person who is not a party and who is not less than 18 years of age. Proof of service shall be made by filing with the Hearing Officer or Director who issued the subpoena a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made the service in person or by return receipts for certified or registered mail.<PRTPAGE P="382"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) A party who requests that a subpoena be issued shall be responsible for the payment of any reasonable travel and subsistence costs incurred by the witness in connection with his or her appearance and any fees of a person who serves the subpoena in person. The Department shall pay the costs associated with the appearance of a Department employee whose role as a witness arises out of his or her performance of official duties, regardless of which party requested the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Hearing Officer or Director as sufficient ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has produced.</P>
            <P>(vi) If a person refuses to obey a subpoena, the Director, acting through the Office of the General Counsel of the Department and the Department of Justice, may apply to the United States District Court in the jurisdiction where that person resides to have the subpoena enforced as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.).</P>
            <P>(3) Testimony required by subpoena pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may, at the discretion of the Director or a Hearing Officer, be presented at the hearing either in person or telephonically.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Hearing procedures applicable to both record review and hearings.</E> (1) Upon the filing of an appeal under this part of an adverse decision by any agency, the agency promptly shall provide the Division with a copy of the agency record. If requested by the applicant prior to the hearing, a copy of such agency record shall be provided to the appellant by the agency within 10 days of receipt of the request by the agency.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director shall assign the appeal to a Hearing Officer and shall notify the appellant and agency of such assignment. The notice also shall advise the appellant and the agency of the documents required to be submitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and notify the appellant of the option of having a hearing by telephone.</P>
            <P>(3) The Hearing Officer will receive evidence into the hearing record without regard to whether the evidence was known to the agency officer, employee, or committee making the adverse decision at the time the adverse decision was made.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures applicable only to hearings.</E> (1) Upon a timely request for a hearing under § 11.6(b), an appellant has the right to have a hearing by the Division on any adverse decision within 45 days after the date of receipt of the request for the hearing by the Division.</P>
            <P>(2) The Hearing Officer shall set a reasonable deadline for submission of the following documents:</P>
            <P>(i) By the appellant;</P>
            <P>(A) A short statement of why the decision is wrong;</P>
            <P>(B) A copy of any document not in the agency record that the appellant anticipates introducing at the hearing; and</P>
            <P>(C) A list of anticipated witnesses and brief descriptions of the evidence such witnesses will offer.</P>
            <P>(ii) By the agency:</P>

            <P>(B) A written explanation of the agency's position, including the regulatory or statutory basis therefor;</P>
            <P>(C) A copy of any document not in the agency record that the agency anticipates introducing at the hearing; and</P>
            <P>(D) A list of anticipated witnesses and brief descriptions of the evidence such witnesses will offer.</P>
            <P>(3) Not less than 14 days prior to the hearing, the Division must provide the appellant, the authorized representative, and the agency a notice of hearing specifying the date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing will be held in the State of residence of the appellant, as determined by the Hearing Officer, or at a location that is otherwise convenient to the appellant, the agency, and the Division. The notice also shall notify all parties of the right to obtain an official record of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Pre-hearing conference.</E> Whenever appropriate, the Hearing Officer shall hold a pre-hearing conference in order to attempt to resolve the dispute or to narrow the issues involved. Such pre-hearing conference shall be held by telephone unless the Hearing Officer and all parties agree to hold such conference in person.<PRTPAGE P="383"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Conduct of the hearing.</E> (i) A hearing before a Hearing Officer will be in person unless the appellant agrees to a hearing by telephone.</P>
            <P>(ii) The hearing will be conducted by the Hearing Officer in the manner determined by the Division most likely to obtain the facts relevant to the matter or matters at issue. The Hearing Officer will allow the presentation of evidence at the hearing by any party without regard to whether the evidence was known to the officer, employee, or committee of the agency making the adverse decision at the time the adverse decision was made. The Hearing Officer may confine the presentation of facts and evidence to pertinent matters and exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, information, or questions. Any party shall have the opportunity to present oral and documentary evidence, oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments in support of the party's position; controvert evidence relied on by any other party; and question all witnesses. When appropriate, agency witnesses requested by the appellant will be made available at the hearing. Any evidence may be received by the Hearing Officer without regard to whether that evidence could be admitted in judicial proceedings.</P>
            <P>(iii) An official record shall be made of the proceedings of every hearing. This record will be made by an official tape recording by the Division. In addition, either party may request that a verbatim transcript be made of the hearing proceedings and that such transcript shall be made the official record of the hearing. The party requesting a verbatim transcript shall pay for the transcription service, shall provide a certified copy of the transcript to the Hearing Officer free of charge, and shall allow any other party desiring to purchase a copy of the transcript to order it from the transcription service.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Absence of parties.</E> (i) If at the time scheduled for the hearing either the appellant or the agency representative is absent, and no appearance is made on behalf of such absent party, or no arrangements have been made for rescheduling the hearing, the Hearing Officer has the option to cancel the hearing unless the absent party has good cause for the failure to appear. If the Hearing Officer elects to cancel the hearing, the Hearing Officer may:</P>
            <P>(A) Treat the appeal as a record review and issue a determination based on the agency record as submitted by the agency and the hearing record developed prior to the hearing date;</P>
            <P>(B) Accept evidence into the hearing record submitted by any party present at the hearing (subject to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section), and then issue a determination; or</P>
            <P>(C) Dismiss the appeal.</P>
            <P>(ii) When a hearing is cancelled due to the absence of a party, the Hearing Officer will add to the hearing record any additional evidence submitted by any party present, provide a copy of such evidence to the absent party or parties, and allow the absent party or parties 10 days to provide a response to such additional evidence for inclusion in the hearing record</P>
            <P>(iii) Where an absent party has demonstrated good cause for the failure to appear, the Hearing Officer shall reschedule the hearing unless all parties agree to proceed without a hearing.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Post-hearing procedure.</E> The Hearing Officer will leave the hearing record open after the hearing for 10 days, or for such other period of time as the Hearing Officer shall establish, to allow the submission of information by the appellant or the agency, to the extent necessary to respond to new facts, information, arguments, or evidence presented or raised at the hearing. Any such new information will be added by the Hearing Office to the hearing record and sent to the other party or parties by the submitter of the information. The Hearing Officer, in his or her discretion, may permit the other party or parties to respond to this post-hearing submission.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Interlocutory review.</E> Interlocutory review by the Director of rulings of a Hearing Officer are not permitted under the procedures of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Burden of proof.</E> The appellant has the burden of proving that the adverse decision of the agency was erroneous by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Timing of issuance of determination.</E> The Hearing Officer will issue a notice of the determination on the appeal to <PRTPAGE P="384"/>the named appellant, the authorized representative, and the agency not later than 30 days after a hearing or the closing date of the hearing record in cases in which the Hearing Officer receives additional evidence from the agency or appellant after a hearing. In the case of a record review, the Hearing Officer will issue a notice of determination within 45 days of receipt of the appellant's request for a record review. Upon the Hearing Officer's request, the Director may establish an earlier or later deadline. A notice of determination shall be accompanied by a copy of the procedures for filing a request for Director review under § 11.9. If the determination is not appealed to the Director for review under § 11.9, the notice provided by the Hearing Officer shall be considered to be a notice of a final determination under this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Director review of determinations of Hearing Officers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requests for Director review.</E> (1) Not later than 30 days after the date on which an appellant receives the determination of a Hearing Officer under § 11.8, the appellant must submit a written request, signed personally by the named appellant, to the Director to review the determination in order to be entitled to such review by the Director. Such request shall include specific reasons why the appellant believes the determination is wrong.</P>
            <P>(2) Not later than 15 business days after the date on which an agency receives the determination of a Hearing Officer under § 11.8, the head of the agency may make a written request that the Director review the determination. Such request shall include specific reasons why the agency believes the determination is wrong, including citations of statutes or regulations that the agency believes the determination violates. Any such request may be made by the head of an agency only, or by a person acting in such capacity, but not by any subordinate officer of such agency.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of Director.</E> (1) The Director will conduct a review of the determination of the Hearing Officer using the agency record, the hearing record, the request for review, any responses submitted under paragraph (c) of this section, and such other arguments or information as may be accepted by the Director, in order to determine whether the decision of the Hearing Officer is supported by substantial evidence. Based on such review, the Director will issue a final determination notice that upholds, reverses, or modifies the determination of the Hearing Officer. The Director's determination upon review of a Hearing Officer's decision shall be considered to be the final determination under this part and shall not be appealable. However, if the Director determines that the hearing record is inadequate or that new evidence has been submitted, the Director may remand all or a portion of the determination to the Hearing Officer for further proceedings to complete the hearing record or, at the option of the Director, to hold a new hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director will complete the review and either issue a final determination or remand the determination not later than—</P>
            <P>(i) 10 business days after receipt of the request for review, in the case of a request by the head of an agency; or</P>
            <P>(ii) 30 business days after receipt of the request for review, in the case of a request by an appellant.</P>

            <P>(3) In any case or any category of cases, the Director may delegate his or her authority to conduct a review under this section to any Deputy or Assistant Directors of the Division. In any case in which such review is conducted by a Deputy or Assistant Director under authority delegated by the <PRTPAGE P="385"/>Director, the Deputy or Assistant Director's determination shall be considered to be the determination of the Director under this part and shall be final and not appealable.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Equitable relief.</E> In reaching a decision on an appeal, the Director shall have the authority to grant equitable relief under this part in the same manner and to the same extent as such authority is provided an agency under applicable laws and regulations.</P>

The Director will not consider any request for reconsideration that does not contain a detailed statement of a material error of fact made in the determination, or a detailed explanation of how the determination is contrary to statute or regulation, which would justify reversal or modification of the determination.</P>
            <P>(b) The Director shall issue a notice to all parties as to whether a request for reconsideration meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. If the request for reconsideration meets such criteria, the Director shall include a copy of the request for reconsideration in the notice to the non-requesting parties to the appeal. The non-requesting parties shall have 5 days from receipt of such notice from the Director to file a response to the request for reconsideration with the Director.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 11.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Participation of third parties and interested parties in Division proceedings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In two situations, parties other than the appellant or the agency may be interested in participating in Division proceedings. In the first situation, a Division proceeding may in fact result in the adjudication of the rights of a third party, e.g., an appeal of a tenant involving a payment shared with a landlord, an appeal by one recipient of a portion of a payment shared by multiple parties, an appeal by one heir of an estate. In the second situation, a party may desire to receive notice of and perhaps participate in an appeal because of the derivative impact the appeal determination will have on that party, e.g., guaranteed lenders and reinsurance companies. The provisions in this section set forth rules for the participation of such third and interested parties.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Third parties.</E> When an appeal is filed, the Division shall notify any potential third party whose rights may be adjudicated of its right to participate as an appellant in the appeal. This includes the right to seek Director review of the Hearing Officer determination. Such third parties may be identified by the Division itself, by an agency, or by the original appellant. The Division shall issue one notice to the third party of its right to participate, and if such party declines to participate, the Division determination will be binding as to that third party as if it had participated. For purposes of this part, a third party includes any party for which a determination of the Division could lead to an agency action on implementation that would be adverse to the party thus giving such party a right to a Division appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Interested parties.</E> With respect to a participant who is a borrower under a guaranteed loan or an insured under a crop insurance program, the respective guaranteed lender or reinsurance company having an interest in a participant's appeal under this part may participate in the appeal as an interested party, but such participation does not confer the status of an appellant upon the guaranteed lender or reinsurance company such that it may request Director review of a final determination of the Division.</P>

Addresses are found in Appendix A of this subpart. In his or her petition, the requester may ask for a fee waiver if there is likely to be a charge for the requested information. The criteria for waiver of fees are found in section 6 of appendix A, subpart A of part 1 of this title. All requests for records shall be deemed to have been made pursuant to FOIA, regardless of whether FOIA is specifically mentioned. To facilitate processing of a request, the phrase “FOIA REQUEST” should be placed in capital letters on the front of the envelope.</P>
            <P>(b) A request must reasonably describe records to enable NAD personnel to locate them with reasonable effort. Where possible, a requester should supply specific information, such as dates, titles, appellant name or appeal number, that may help identify the records. If the request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the court and its location should be identified.</P>
            <P>(c) If NAD determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records, it shall inform the requester of this fact and extend the requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to confer promptly with knowledgeable NAD personnel to attempt to identify the records he or she is seeking. The “date of receipt” in such instances, for purposes of § 1.12(a) of this title, shall be the date of receipt of the amended or clarified request.</P>

            <P>(d) Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted to preclude NAD from honoring an oral request for information, but if the requester is dissatisfied with the response, the NAD official involved shall advise the requester to submit a written request in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The “date of receipt” of such a request for purposes of § 1.12(a) of this title shall be the date of receipt of the written request. For recordkeeping purposes, the <PRTPAGE P="388"/>NAD official responding to an oral request for information may ask the requester to also submit his or her request in writing.</P>
            <P>(e) If a request for records or a fee waiver under this subpart is denied, the person making the request shall have the right to appeal the denial. Requesters also may appeal NAD decisions regarding a requester's status for purposes of fee levels under section 5 of Appendix A, subpart A of part 1 of this title. All appeals must be in writing and addressed to the official designated in § 11.33. To facilitate processing of an appeal, the phrase “FOIA APPEAL” should be placed in capital letters on the front of the envelope.</P>
            <P>(f) NAD shall develop and maintain a record of all written and oral FOIA requests and FOIA appeals received by NAD, which shall include, in addition to any other information, the name of the requester, brief summary of the information requested, an indication of whether the request or appeal was denied or partially denied, the FOIA exemption(s) cited as the basis for any denials, and the amount of fees associated with the request or appeal.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Actions.</E> Except as provided in §§ 12.5 or 12.13, a person shall be ineligible for all or a portion of USDA program benefits listed in this section if:</P>
            <P>(1) The person produces an agricultural commodity on a field in which highly erodible land is predominant, or designates such a field for conservation use;</P>
            <P>(2) The person produces an agricultural commodity on a wetland that was converted after December 23, 1985; or</P>
            <P>(3) After November 28, 1990, the person converts a wetland by draining, dredging, filling, leveling, removing woody vegetation, or other means for the purpose, or to have the effect, of making the production of an agricultural commodity possible.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Highly erodible land.</E> A person determined to be ineligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be ineligible for all program benefits listed in (d) and (e) of this section.</P>

Except as provided in § 12.13, a person determined to be ineligible under paragraph (a)(3) of this section for the conversion of a wetland is ineligible for all or a portion of the USDA program benefits listed in paragraph (d) of this section for which the person otherwise would have been eligible during the crop year which is equal to the calendar year during which the violation occurred and each subsequent crop year until the converted wetland is restored or the loss of wetland values, acreage, and functions have been mitigated prior to the beginning of such calendar year in accordance with § 12.5(b)(4)(i) (A) and (C) through (F) of this part. Ineligibility under paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be reduced, in lieu of the loss of all benefits specified under paragraph (d) of this section for such crop year, based on the seriousness of the violation, as determined by the FSA Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs or designee upon recommendation by the FSA County Committee. Factors such as the information that was available to the affected person prior to the violation, previous land use patterns, the existence of previous wetland violations under this part or under other Federal, State, or local wetland provisions, the wetland values, acreage, and functions affected, the recovery time for full mitigation of the wetland values, acreage, and functions, and the impact that a reduction in payments would have on the person's ability to repay a USDA farm loan will be considered in making this determination.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Programs subject to either highly erodible land or wetland conservation.</E> USDA program benefits covered by a determination of ineligibility under this rule are:</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemptions regarding highly erodible land</E>—(1) <E T="03">Highly erodible cropland in production or in USDA programs during 1981 through 1985 crop years.</E> During the period beginning on December 23, 1985, and ending on the later of January 1, 1990, or the date that is two years after the date the cropland on which an agricultural commodity is produced was surveyed by NRCS to determine if such land is highly erodible, no person shall be determined to be ineligible for benefits as provided in § 12.4 as the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on any highly erodible land:</P>
            <P>(i) That was planted to an agricultural commodity in any year 1981 through 1985; or</P>
            <P>(ii) That was set aside, diverted, or otherwise not cultivated in any such crop years under a program administered by the Secretary for any such crops to reduce production of an agricultural commodity.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Compliance with a conservation plan or conservation system.</E> As further specified in this part, no person shall be ineligible for the program benefits described in § 12.4 as the result of production of an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or the designation of such land for conservation use if such production or designation is in compliance with a conservation plan or conservation system approved under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section. A person shall not be ineligible for program benefits under § 12.4 as the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or as the result of designation of such land as conservation use if the production or designation is:</P>
            <P>(i) In an area within a CD, under a conservation system that has been approved by the CD after the CD determines that the conservation system is in conformity with technical standards set forth in the NRCS field office technical guide for such district; or</P>
            <P>(ii) In an area not within a CD, under a conservation system that has been approved by NRCS to be adequate for the production of such agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or for the designation of such land as conservation use.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reliance upon NRCS determination for highly erodible land.</E> A person may be relieved from ineligibility for program benefits as the result of the production of an agricultural commodity which was produced on highly erodible land or for the designation of such land as conservation use in reliance on a determination by NRCS that such land was not highly erodible land, except <PRTPAGE P="396"/>that this paragraph shall not apply to any agricultural commodity that was planted on highly erodible land, or for the designation of highly erodible land as conservation use after NRCS determines that such land is highly erodible land, and the person is notified of such determinations.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Areas of 2 acres or less.</E> No person shall be determined to be ineligible under § 12.4 for noncommercial production of agricultural commodities on highly erodible land on an area of 2 acres or less if it is determined by FSA that such production is not intended to circumvent the conservation requirements otherwise applicable under this part.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Good faith.</E> (i) No person will become ineligible under § 12.4 as a result of the failure of such person to apply a conservation system on highly erodible land if all of the following apply:</P>
            <P>(A) FSA determines such person has acted in good faith and without the intent to violate the provisions of this part;</P>
            <P>(B) NRCS determines that the person complies with paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(C) The good faith determination of the FSA county or State committee has been reviewed and approved by the applicable State Executive Director, with the technical concurrence of the State Conservationist; or district director, with the technical concurrence of the area conservationist.</P>
            <P>(ii) A person who otherwise meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) and (a)(5)(i)(C) of this section will be allowed a reasonable period of time, as determined by NRCS, but not to exceed one year, during which to implement the measures and practices necessary to be considered actively applying the person's conservation plan, as determined by USDA. If a person does not take the required corrective actions, the person may be determined to be ineligible for the crop year during which such actions were to be taken, as well as any subsequent crop year.</P>
            <P>(iii) Notwithstanding the good-faith requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, if NRCS observes a possible compliance deficiency while providing on-site technical assistance, NRCS will provide to the responsible person, not later than 45 days after observing the possible violation, information regarding actions needed to comply with the plan and this subtitle. NRCS will provide this information in lieu of reporting the observation as a violation, if the responsible person attempts to correct the deficiencies as soon as practicable, as determined by NRCS, after receiving the information, but not later than one year after receiving the information. If a person does not take the required corrective actions, the person may be determined to be ineligible for the crop year during which the compliance deficiencies occurred, as well as any subsequent crop year.</P>
            <P>(iv) A person who meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section will, in lieu of the loss of all benefits specified under § 12.4(d) and (e) for such crop year, be subject to a reduction in benefits by an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, as determined by FSA. The dollar amount of the reduction will be determined by FSA and may be based on the number of acres and the degree of erosion hazard for the area in violation, as determined by NRCS, or upon such other factors as FSA determines appropriate.</P>
            <P>(v) Any person whose benefits are reduced in a crop year under paragraph (a)(5) of this section may be eligible for all of the benefits specified under § 12.4(d) and (e) for any subsequent crop year if, prior to the beginning of the subsequent crop year, NRCS determines that such person is actively applying a conservation plan according to the schedule specified in the plan on all highly erodible land planted to an agricultural commodity or designated as conservation use.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Allowable variances.</E> (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, no person shall be determined to be ineligible for benefits as a result of the failure of such person to apply a conservation system if NRCS determines that—</P>

            <P>(A) The failure is technical and minor in nature and that such violation has little effect on the erosion control purposes of the conservation plan applicable to the land on which the violation has occurred; or<PRTPAGE P="397"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) The failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the person; or</P>
            <P>(C) NRCS grants a temporary variance from the practices specified in the plan for the purpose of handling a specific problem, including weather, pest, and disease problems, which NRCS determines cannot reasonably be addressed except through such variance.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the person's request for a temporary variance involves the use of practices or measures to address weather, pest, or disease problems, NRCS shall make a decision on whether to grant the variance during the 30-day period beginning on the date of receipt of the request. If NRCS fails to render a decision during the period, the temporary variance shall be considered granted unless the person seeking the variance had reason to know that the variance would not be granted. In determining whether to grant a variance for natural disasters such as weather, pest, or disease problems, NRCS will consider such factors as:</P>
            <P>(A) The percent of a stand damaged or destroyed by the event;</P>
            <P>(B) The percent of expected crop production compared to normal production for that crop;</P>
            <P>(C) The documented invasion of non-native insects, weeds, or diseases for which no recognized treatment exists;</P>
            <P>(D) Whether an event is severe or unusual based on historical weather records; and</P>
            <P>(E) Other specific circumstances caused by a natural event that prevented the implementation of conservation practices or systems, installation of structures, or planting of cover crops.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Technical and minor violations.</E> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, a reduction in benefits in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, as determined by FSA, and consistent with paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section, will be applied if NRCS determines that a violation involving highly erodible land that would otherwise lead to a loss of benefits is both of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Technical and minor in nature; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Has a minimal effect on the erosion control purposes of the conservation plan applicable to the land on which the violation occurred.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemptions for wetlands and converted wetlands</E>—(1) <E T="03">General exemptions.</E> A person shall not be determined to be ineligible for program benefits under § 12.4 as the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on converted wetland or the conversion of wetland if:</P>
            <P>(i) The land is a prior-converted cropland and meets the definition of a prior-converted cropland as of the date of a wetland determination by NRCS;</P>
            <P>(ii) The land has been determined by NRCS to be a prior-converted cropland and such determination has been certified, and NRCS determines that the wetland characteristics returned after the date of the wetland certification as a result of—</P>
            <P>(A) The lack of maintenance of drainage, dikes, levees, or similar structures,</P>
            <P>(B) The lack of management of the lands containing the wetland, or</P>
            <P>(C) Circumstances beyond the control of the person;</P>
            <P>(iii) The land was determined by NRCS to be a farmed wetland or a farmed-wetland pasture and—</P>
            <P>(A) Such land meets wetland criteria through a voluntary restoration, enhancement, or creation action after that determination,</P>
            <P>(B) The technical determinations regarding the baseline site conditions and the restoration, enhancement, or creation action have been adequately documented by NRCS,</P>
            <P>(C) The proposed conversion action is documented by the NRCS prior to implementation, and</P>
            <P>(D) The extent of the proposed conversion is limited so that the conditions will be at least equivalent to the wetland values, acreage, and functions that existed at the time of implementation of the voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation action;</P>

            <P>(iv) NRCS has determined that the conversion if for a purpose that does not make the production of an agricultural commodity possible, such as conversions for fish production, trees, vineyards, shrubs, cranberries, agricultural waste management structures, <PRTPAGE P="398"/>livestock ponds, fire control, or building and road construction and no agricultural commodity is produced on such land;</P>
            <P>(v) NRCS has determined that the actions of the person with respect to the conversion of the wetland or the combined effect of the production of an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted by the person or by someone else, individually and in connection with all other similar actions authorized by NRCS in the area, would have only a minimal effect on the wetland functions and values of wetlands in the area;</P>
            <P>(vi)(A) After December 23, 1985, the Army Corps of Engineers issued an individual permit pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, authorizing such action and the permit required mitigation that adequately replaced the values, acreage, and functions of the wetlands converted, as determined by NRCS, or</P>
            <P>(B) After December 23, 1985, the action is encompassed under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, by an Army Corps of Engineers nationwide or regional general permit and the wetland values, acreage, and functions were adequately mitigated, as determined by NRCS; or</P>
            <P>(vii) The land is determined by NRCS to be—</P>
            <P>(A) An artificial wetland,</P>
            <P>(B) A wet area created by a water delivery system, irrigation, irrigation system, or application of water for irrigation,</P>
            <P>(C) A nontidal drainage or irrigation ditch excavated in non-wetland, or</P>
            <P>(D) A wetland converted by actions of persons other than the person applying for USDA program benefits or any of the person's predecessors in interest after December 23, 1985, if such conversion was not the result of a scheme or device to avoid compliance with this part. Further drainage improvement on such land is not permitted without loss of eligibility for USDA program benefits, unless NRCS determines under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section that further drainage activities applied to such land would have minimal effect on the wetland functions and values in the area. In applying this paragraph, a converted wetland shall be presumed to have been converted by the person applying for USDA program benefits unless the person can show that the conversion was caused by a third party with whom the person was not associated through a scheme or device as described under § 12.10 of this part. In this regard, activities of a water resource district, drainage district, or similar entity will be attributed to all persons within the jurisdiction of the district or other entity who are assessed for the activities of the district or entity. Accordingly, where a person's wetland is converted due to the actions of the district or entity, the person shall be considered to have caused or permitted the drainage. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentences and as determined by FSA to be consistent with the purposes of this part, the activities of a drainage district or other similar entity will not be attributed to a person to the extent that the activities of the district or entity were beyond the control of the person and the wetland converted is not used by the person for the production of an agricultural commodity or a forage crop for harvest by mechanical means or mitigation for the converted wetland occurs in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Commenced conversion wetlands.</E> (i) The purpose of a determination of a commenced conversion made under this paragraph is to implement the legislative intent that those persons who had actually started conversion of a wetland or obligated funds for conversion prior to December 23, 1985, would be allowed to complete the conversion so as to avoid unnecessary economic hardship.</P>
            <P>(ii) All persons who believed they had a wetland or converted wetland for which conversion began but was not completed prior to December 23, 1985, must have requested by September 19, 1988, FSA to make a determination of commencement in order to be considered exempt under this section.</P>

            <P>(iii) Any conversion activity considered by FSA to be commenced under this section lost its exempt status if such activity as not completed on or before January 1, 1995. For purposes of this part, land on which such conversion activities were completed by January 1, 1995, shall be evaluated by the <PRTPAGE P="399"/>same standards and qualify for the same exemptions as prior-converted croplands. For purposes of this part, land on which such conversion activities were not completed by January 1, 1995, shall be evaluated by the same standards and qualify for the same exemptions as wetlands or farmed wetlands, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(iv) Only those wetlands for which the construction had begun, or to which the contract or purchased supplies and materials related, qualified for a determination of commencement. However, in those circumstances where the conversion of wetland did not meet the specific requirements of this paragraph, the person could have requested a commencement of conversion determination from the FSA Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, upon a showing that undue economic hardship would have resulted because of substantial financial obligations incurred prior to December 23, 1985, for the primary and direct purpose of converting the wetland.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Wetlands farmed under natural conditions.</E> A person shall not be determined to be ineligible for program benefits under § 12.4 of this part as a result of the production of an agricultural commodity on a wetland on which the owner or operator of a farm or ranch uses normal cropping or ranching practices to produce agricultural commodities in a manner that is consistent for the area, where such production is possible as a result of natural conditions, such as drought, and is without action by the producer that alters the hydrology or removes woody vegetation.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Mitigation.</E> (i) No person shall be determined to be ineligible under § 12.4 for any action associated with the conversion of a wetland if the wetland values, acreage, and functions are adequately mitigated, as determined by NRCS, through the restoration of a converted wetland, the enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland, if the mitigation—</P>
            <P>(A) Is in accordance with a mitigation plan approved by NRCS;</P>
            <P>(B) Is in advance of, or concurrent with, the wetland conversion or the production of an agricultural commodity, as applicable;</P>
            <P>(C) Is not at the expense of the federal government in either supporting the direct or indirect costs of the restoration activity or costs associated with acquiring or securing mitigation sites, except if conducted under a mitigation banking program established by USDA;</P>
            <P>(D) Occurs on lands in the same general area of the local watershed as the converted wetlands, provided that for purposes of this paragraph, lands in the same general area of the local watershed may include regional mitigation banks;</P>
            <P>(E) Is on lands for which the owner has granted an easement to USDA or in the case of a mitigation bank operated under a USDA program, an entity approved by USDA, recorded the easement on public land records, and has agreed to the maintenance of the restored, created, or enhanced wetland for as long as the converted wetland for which the mitigation occurred remains in agricultural use or is not returned to its original wetland classification with equivalent values, acreage, and functions; and</P>
            <P>(F) Provides the equivalent values, acreage, and functions that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion.</P>
            <P>(ii) A mitigation plan is a record of decisions that document the actions necessary to compensate for the loss of wetland values, acreage, and functions that result from converting a wetland. The mitigation plan may be a component of a larger natural resources conservation plan.</P>

            <P>(iii) The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, may name certain types or classes of wetland not eligible for exemption under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section where the State Conservationist determines that mitigation will not achieve equivalent replacement of wetland values, acreage, and functions within a reasonable time frame or for other reasons identified by the State Conservationist. Any type or class of wetland that a State Conservationist identifies as not eligible for exemption under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for inclusion in this part.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Good faith violations.</E> (i) A person who is determined under § 12.4 of this <PRTPAGE P="400"/>part to be ineligible for benefits as the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted after December 23, 1985, or as the result of the conversion of a wetland after November 28, 1990, may regain eligibility for benefits if all of the following apply:</P>
            <P>(A) FSA determines that such person acted in good faith and without the intent to violate the wetland provisions of this part; and</P>
            <P>(B) NRCS determines that the person is implementing all practices in a mitigation plan within an agreed-to period, not to exceed one year; and</P>
            <P>(C) The good faith determination of the FSA county or State committee has been reviewed and approved by the applicable State Executive Director, with the technical concurrence of the State Conservationist; or district director, with the technical concurrence of the area conservationist.</P>
            <P>(ii) In determining whether a person acted in good faith under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the FSA shall consider such factors as whether—</P>
            <P>(A) The characteristics of the site were such that the person should have been aware that a wetland existed on the subject land,</P>
            <P>(B) NRCS had informed the person about the existence of a wetland on the subject land,</P>
            <P>(C) The person did not convert the wetland, but planted an agricultural commodity on converted wetland when the person should have known that a wetland previously existed on the subject land,</P>
            <P>(D) The person has a record of violating the wetland provisions of this part or other Federal, State, or local wetland provisions, or</P>
            <P>(E) There exists other information that demonstrates that the person acted with the intent to violate the wetland provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(iii) After the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section are met, USDA may waive applying the ineligibility provisions of § 12.4.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Reliance upon NRCS wetland determination.</E> (i) A person shall not be ineligible for program benefits as a result of taking an action in reliance on a previous certified wetland determination by NRCS.</P>
            <P>(ii) A person who may be ineligible for program benefits as the result of the production of an agricultural commodity on converted wetland or for the conversion of a wetland may seek relief under § 12.11 of this part if such action was taken in reliance on an incorrect technical determination by NRCS as to the status of such land. If the error caused the person to make a substantial financial investment, as determined by the NRCS, for the conversion of a wetland, the person may be relieved of ineligibility for actions related to that portion of the converted wetland for which the substantial financial investment was expended in conversion activities. The relief available under this paragraph shall not apply to situations in which the person knew or reasonably should have known that the determination was in error because the characteristics of the site were such that the person should have been aware that a wetland existed on the subject land, or for other reasons.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Responsibility to provide evidence.</E> It is the responsibility of the person seeking an exemption related to converted wetlands under this section to provide evidence, such as receipts, crop-history data, drawings, plans or similar information, for purposes of determining whether the conversion or other action is exempt in accordance with this section.</P>

            <P>(C) The percentage reduction will be applied to all policies and plans of insurance of the landlord in the reinsurance year subsequent to the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>
            <P>(D) If the landlord and tenant or sharecropper are insured under the same policy, the landlord will be ineligible for premium subsidy on that policy in lieu of a percentage reduction on that policy.</P>
            <P>(2) If the production of an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land or converted wetland by the landlord's tenant or sharecropper is required under the terms and conditions of the agreement between the landlord and such tenant or sharecropper and such agreement was entered into after December 23, 1985, or if the landlord has acquiesced in such activities by the tenant or sharecropper:</P>

            <P>(ii) A landlord will be ineligible for premium subsidy on all policies and plans of insurance in the reinsurance year subsequent to the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>

            <P>(ii) In lieu of ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for all policies or plans of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), the premium subsidy on all policies and plans of insurance of the ineligible tenant or sharecropper will be reduced.</P>
            <P>(A) The percentage reduction will be determined by comparing the total number of cropland acres on the farm on which the violation occurred to the total number of cropland acres on all farms in which tenant or sharecropper has an interest, as determined by FSA.</P>
            <P>(B) The farms and cropland acres used to determine the premium subsidy reduction percentage will be the farms and cropland acres of the tenant or sharecropper for the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>
            <P>(C) The percentage reduction will be applied to all policies and plans of insurance of the tenant or sharecropper in the reinsurance year subsequent to the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special Federal crop insurance premium subsidy provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The provisions and exemptions in this section are only applicable to Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524). The exemptions in this section are in addition to any that apply under § 12.5. Any conflict between this section and another will be resolved by applying this section, but only for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies. Any exemptions or relief under this section apply to Federal crop insurance premium subsidies and do not apply to other benefits even for the same person for the same crop year or reinsurance year. Unless otherwise specified in this section, the provisions in this section apply to both highly erodible land and wetlands.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Ineligibility for failing to certify compliance.</E> Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, failing to certify compliance as specified in § 12.7 will result in ineligibility as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) A Form AD-1026, or successor form, for the person must be filed with FSA for the reinsurance year in order for the person to be eligible for any Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for the reinsurance year. Persons will be ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy on their crop insurance policy if form AD-1026, or successor form, has not been filed with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date for their Federally-reinsured crop insurance policy.</P>

            <P>(2) A person that has not filed an AD-1026 for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date may be eligible for premium subsidy for the reinsurance year if they provide information <PRTPAGE P="407"/>necessary for the person's filing of a Form AD-1026 if the person:</P>
            <P>(i) Is unable to file a Form AD-1026 due to circumstances beyond the person's control, as determined by FSA; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Files a Form AD-1026 in good faith and FSA subsequently determines that additional information is needed, but the person is unable to comply due to circumstances beyond the control of the person.</P>
            <P>(3) A person who does not have Form AD-1026, or successor form, on file with FSA for the reinsurance year may be eligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy for the initial reinsurance year if the person can demonstrate they meet RMA's conditions for new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new entity, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ineligibility for violations.</E> If a person is ineligible due to a violation of the provisions of this part, the timing and results will be as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Unless an exemption in this section or § 12.5 applies, ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) due to a violation of the provisions of this part will:</P>
            <P>(i) Not apply to the reinsurance year in which the violation occurred or any reinsurance year prior to the date of the final determination of a violation, including all administrative appeals of the determination, as determined by NRCS or FSA as applicable; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Only apply to reinsurance years subsequent to the date of a final determination of a violation, including all administrative appeals of the determination, as determined by NRCS or FSA as applicable. A person who is in violation of the provisions of this part, as determined by FSA or NRCS, in a reinsurance year, will, unless otherwise exempted, be ineligible for any Federal crop insurance premium subsidy beginning with the subsequent reinsurance year. For example, a person who is determined to be in violation of the provisions of this part and has exhausted all administrative appeals on June 1, 2015, (2015 reinsurance year) will, unless otherwise exempted, be ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy effective July 1, 2015, the start of the 2016 reinsurance year, and will not be eligible for any Federal crop insurance premium subsidy for any policy or plan of insurance during the 2016 reinsurance year. Even if the person becomes compliant during the 2016 reinsurance year, the person will not be eligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy until the 2017 reinsurance year starting on July 1, 2016.</P>
            <P>(2) Eligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidy for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) due to a violation of the provisions of this part will be based on FSA and NRCS final determinations, including all administrative appeals, regarding compliance with the provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) The amount of premium subsidy for an insured person will be reduced when any person with a substantial beneficial interest in the insured person is ineligible for premium subsidy under this part. The amount of reduction will be commensurate with the ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the insured person. The ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the insured person will be determined according to the policy provisions of the insured person.</P>
            <P>(4) Administrative appeals include appeals made in accordance with § 12.12 and part 11 of this title, but do not include any judicial review or appeal, or any other legal action.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption to develop and comply with an approved HEL conservation plan.</E> The following exemptions provide a delay in the requirement to develop and comply with an NRCS approved HEL conservation plan for certain persons.</P>

            <P>(1) Persons subject to the provisions of this part regarding highly erodible land, specifically those related to section 1211(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, for the first time solely due to amendments to that section by section 2611(a) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (16 U.S.C. 3811(a)(1)), will have 5 reinsurance years after the date the person is determined to have HEL and has exhausted all administrative appeals, if applicable, to develop and comply with a conservation plan <PRTPAGE P="408"/>approved by NRCS before being ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies. The additional time to develop and comply with a conservation plan approved by NRCS applies only to persons who have not previously been subject to the highly erodible land conservation provisions of this part. The additional time provided in this paragraph does not apply to any person who had any interest in any land or crop, including an affiliated person, that was subject to the provisions of this part before February 7, 2014. The 5 reinsurance years to develop and comply with a conservation plan approved by NRCS starts:</P>
            <P>(i) For persons who have no land with an NRCS HEL determination, the 5 reinsurance years begins the start of the reinsurance year (July 1) following the date NRCS makes a HEL determination and the person exhausts all their administrative appeals; or</P>
            <P>(ii) For persons who have any land for which an NRCS HEL determination has been made and all administrative appeals have been exhausted, the 5 reinsurance years begins the start of the reinsurance year (July 1) following the date the person certifies compliance with FSA to be eligible for USDA benefits subject to the conservation compliance provisions.</P>
            <P>(2) Persons who meet all the following criteria will have 2 reinsurance years from the start of the reinsurance year (July 1) following the date the person certifies compliance with FSA to be eligible for USDA benefits subject to the conservation compliance provisions to develop and comply with a conservation plan approved by NRCS before being ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies:</P>
            <P>(i) Were subject to the provisions of this part regarding highly erodible land, specifically those related to section 1211(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3811(a)(1)), as amended, any time before February 7, 2014;</P>
            <P>(ii) Before February 7, 2014, stopped participating in all USDA programs subject to the provisions of this part regarding highly erodible land;</P>
            <P>(iii) Would have been in violation of the provisions of this part regarding highly erodible land had they continued to participate in those programs after February 7, 2014; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Are currently in violation of the provisions of this part regarding highly erodible land.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemption for prior wetland conversions completed prior to February 7, 2014.</E> No person will be ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) for:</P>
            <P>(1) Converting a wetland if the wetland conversion was completed, as determined by NRCS, before February 7, 2014; or</P>
            <P>(2) Planting or producing an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland if the wetland conversion was completed, as determined by NRCS, before February 7, 2014.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemption for wetland conversion that impacts less than 5 acres.</E> The following exemption is for wetland conversion that impacts less than 5 acres of an entire farm:</P>
            <P>(1) In lieu of ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) due to a wetland conversion violation or concurrent with a planned wetland conversion occurring after February 7, 2014, a person may, if approved by NRCS, pay a contribution to NRCS in an amount equal to 150 percent of the cost of mitigating the converted wetland, as determined by NRCS.</P>
            <P>(2) A person is limited to only one exemption, as determined by NRCS, described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section per farm.</P>
            <P>(3) NRCS will not refund this payment even if the person later conducts actions which will mitigate the earlier conversion.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Exemption for wetland conversion when a policy or plan of insurance is available to a person for the first time.</E> The following exemption is for wetland conversion when a policy or plan of insurance is available to the person for the first time.</P>

            <P>(1) When a policy or plan of insurance that provides coverage for an agricultural commodity is available to the person, including as a person who is a substantial beneficial interest holder, <PRTPAGE P="409"/>for the first time after February 7, 2014, as determined by RMA, ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for such policy or plan of insurance due to a wetland conversion violation will only apply to wetland conversions that are completed, as determined by NRCS, after the date the policy or plan of insurance first becomes available to the person.</P>
            <P>(2) The exemption described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Applies only to the policy or plan of insurance that becomes available to the person for the first time after February 7, 2014, as determined by RMA;</P>
            <P>(ii) Does not exempt or otherwise negate the person's ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies on any other policy or plan of insurance; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Applies only if the person takes steps necessary, as determined by NRCS, to mitigate all wetlands converted after February 7, 2014, in a timely manner, as determined by NRCS, but not to exceed 2 reinsurance years.</P>
            <P>(3) For the purposes of the paragraph (g)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) A policy or plan of insurance is considered to have been available to the person after February 7, 2014, if, after February 7, 2014, in any county in which the person had any interest in any acreage, including as a person who is a substantial beneficial interest holder:</P>
            <P>(A) There was a policy or plan of insurance available on the county actuarial documents that provided coverage for the agricultural commodity; or</P>
            <P>(B) The person obtained a written agreement to insure the agricultural commodity in any county; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Changing, adding, or removing options, endorsements, or coverage to an existing policy or plan of insurance will not be considered as a policy or plan of insurance being available for the first time to a person.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Wetland conversion mitigation exemption.</E> Unless another exemption applies, the following exemption provides additional time to mitigate wetland conversions.</P>
            <P>(1) A person determined to be in violation of the provisions of this part due to a wetland conversion occurring after February 7, 2014, will have 1 reinsurance year after the final determination of violation, including all administrative appeals, as determined by NRCS, to initiate a mitigation plan to remedy the violation, as determined by NRCS, before becoming ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524.). For example, if in May 2017, after NRCS has determined that a person is in violation for converting a wetland and the person has exhausted all administrative appeals, the person will have until June 30, 2018, to initiate a mitigation plan to remedy the violation before becoming ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies starting with the 2019 reinsurance year.</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this section, if a person determined to be in violation of the provisions of this part due to a wetland conversion occurring after February 7, 2014, as determined by NRCS, and is subject to the provisions of this part for the first time solely due to section 2611(b) of the Agricultural Act of 2014, such person will have 2 reinsurance years after the final determination of violation, including all administrative appeals, as determined by NRCS, to be implementing all practices in a mitigation plan to remedy the violation, as determined by NRCS, before becoming ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524).</P>
            <P>(3) Administrative appeals include appeals made in accordance with § 12.12 and part 11 of this title, but do not include any judicial review or appeal, or any other legal action.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Good faith exemption.</E> The following is a good faith exemption for wetland conservation:</P>

            <P>(1) A person determined by FSA or NRCS to be in violation, including all administrative appeals, of the provisions of this part due to converting a wetland after February 7, 2014, or producing an agricultural commodity on a wetland that was converted after February 7, 2014, may regain eligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act <PRTPAGE P="410"/>(7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(i) FSA determines that such person acted in good faith and without the intent to violate the wetland conservation provisions of this part;</P>
            <P>(ii) NRCS determines that the person is implementing all practices in a mitigation plan to remedy or mitigate the violation within an agreed-to period, not to exceed 2 reinsurance years; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The good faith determination of the FSA county or State committee has been reviewed and approved by the applicable State Executive Director, with the technical concurrence of the State Conservationist; or District Director, with the technical concurrence of the area conservationist.</P>
            <P>(2) In determining whether a person acted in good faith under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, FSA will consider such factors as whether:</P>
            <P>(i) The characteristics of the site were such that the person should have been aware that a wetland existed on the subject land;</P>
            <P>(ii) NRCS had informed the person about the existence of a wetland on the subject land;</P>

            <P>(iv) There exists other information that demonstrates the person acted with the intent to violate the wetland conservation provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) After the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section are met, FSA may waive applying the ineligibility provisions of this section to allow the person to implement the mitigation plan approved by NRCS. The waiver will apply for up to two reinsurance years.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Landlord and Tenant wetland violations relief.</E> The following provides landlord and tenant relief for wetland violations:</P>
            <P>(1) Except as provided in (j)(2) of this section, the ineligibility of a tenant or sharecropper for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) will, in lieu of ineligibility for premium subsidy, result in a reduction in the amount of premium subsidy paid by FCIC on all policies and plans of insurance for the landlord.</P>
            <P>(i) The percentage reduction will be determined by comparing the total number of cropland acres on the farm on which the violation occurred to the total number of cropland acres on all farms in which landlord has an interest, as determined by FSA.</P>
            <P>(ii) The farms and cropland acres used to determine the premium subsidy reduction percentage will be the farms and cropland acres of the landlord for the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>
            <P>(iii) The percentage reduction will be applied to all policies and plans of insurance of the landlord in the reinsurance year subsequent to the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the landlord and tenant or sharecropper are insured under the same policy, the landlord will be ineligible for premium subsidy on that policy in lieu of a percentage reduction on that policy.</P>
            <P>(2) A landlord will be ineligible for the premium subsidy on all policies and plans of insurance in the reinsurance year subsequent to the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible if the production of an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland by the landlord's tenant or sharecropper is required under the terms and conditions of the agreement between the landlord and such tenant or sharecropper and such agreement was entered into after February 7, 2014, or if the landlord has acquiesced in such activities by the tenant or sharecropper.</P>
            <P>(3) If all the requirements in paragraph (j)(4) of this section are met, in lieu of ineligibility for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for all policies or plans of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) for producing or planting an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted after February 7, 2014, the premium subsidy on all policies and plans of insurance of the ineligible tenant or sharecropper will be reduced.</P>

            <P>(i) The percentage reduction will be determined by comparing the total number of cropland acres on the farm <PRTPAGE P="411"/>on which the violation occurred to the total number of cropland acres on all farms in which tenant or sharecropper has an interest, as determined by FSA.</P>
            <P>(ii) The farms and cropland acres used to determine the premium subsidy reduction percentage will be the farms and cropland acres of the tenant or sharecropper for the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>
            <P>(iii) The percentage reduction will be applied to all policies and plans of insurance of the tenant or sharecropper in the reinsurance year subsequent to the reinsurance year in which the tenant or sharecropper is determined ineligible.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the landlord and tenant or sharecropper are insured under the same policy, the tenant or sharecropper will be ineligible for premium subsidy on that policy in lieu of a percentage reduction on that policy.</P>
            <P>(4) The provisions of paragraph (j)(3) of this section will not apply unless all the following are met:</P>
            <P>(i) The tenant or sharecropper shows that a good-faith effort was made to comply by developing a plan, approved by NRCS, for the restoration or mitigation of the converted wetland in a timely manner and prior to any violation;</P>
            <P>(ii) The owner of such farm refuses to apply such a plan and prevents the tenant or sharecropper from implementing the approved plan;</P>
            <P>(iii) FSA determines the lack of compliance is not a part of a scheme or device as described in § 12.10; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The tenant or sharecropper actively applies the practices and measures of the approved plan that are within their control.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Evaluation of certification.</E> NRCS will evaluate the certification in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>(1) A person who properly completes, signs, and files Form AD-1026, or successor form, with FSA certifying compliance with the provisions of this part will be eligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) during the period of time such certification is being evaluated by NRCS, if an evaluation is required.</P>
            <P>(2) A person will not be ineligible for Federal crop insurance premium subsidies for a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) if:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Identification of highly erodible lands criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for identification as highly erodible.</E> Soil map units and an erodibility index will be used as the basis for identifying highly erodible land. The erodibility index for a soil is determined by dividing the potential average annual rate of erosion for each soil by its predetermined soil loss tolerance (T) value. The T value represents the maximum annual rate of soil erosion that could occur without causing a decline in long-term productivity. The equation for measuring erosion is described below.</P>
            <P>(1) The potential average annual rate of sheet and rill erosion is estimated by multiplying the following factors of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE):</P>
            <P>(i) Rainfall and runoff (R);</P>
            <P>(ii) The degree to which the soil resists water erosion (K); and</P>
            <P>(iii) The function (LS), which includes the effects of slope length (L) and steepness (S).</P>
            <P>(2) The potential average annual rate of wind erosion is estimated by multiplying the following factors of the Wind Erosion Equation (WEQ): Climatic characterization of windspeed and surface soil moisture (C) and the degree to which soil resists wind erosion (I).</P>
            <P>(3) The USLE is explained in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook 537, “Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses.” The WEQ is explained in the paper by Woodruff, N.P., and F. H. Siddaway, 1965, “A Wind Erosion Equation,” Soil Science Society of America Proceedings, Vol. 29. No. 5, pages 602-608. Values for all the factors used in these equations are contained in the NRCS field office technical guide and the references which are a part of the guide. The Universal Soil Loss Equation, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, and the Wind Erosion Equation and the rules under which NRCS uses the equations are published at §§ 610.11 through 610.15 of this title.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Highly erodible.</E> A soil map unit shall be determined to be highly erodible if either the RKLS/T or the CI/T value for the map unit equals or exceeds 8.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Potentially highly erodible.</E> Whenever a soil map unit description contains a range of a slope length and steepness characteristics that produce a range of LS values that result in RKLS/T quotients both above and below 8, the soil map unit will be entered on the list of highly erodible soil map units as “potentially highly erodible.” The final determination of erodibility for an individual field containing these soil map unit delineations will be made by an on-site investigation, or by use of Light Detection and Ranging or other elevation data of an adequate resolution to make slope length and steepness measurements. In any case where a person disagrees with <PRTPAGE P="413"/>an off-site determination on potentially highly erodible soils, a determination will be made on-site.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Highly erodible field determination criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Predominance.</E> Highly erodible land shall be considered to be predominant on a field if either:</P>
            <P>(1) 33.33 percent or more of the total field acreage is identified as soil map units which are highly erodible; or</P>
            <P>(2) 50 or more acres in such field are identified as soil map units which are highly erodible.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Modification of field boundaries.</E> A person may request the modification of field boundaries for the purpose of excluding highly erodible land from a field. Such a request must be submitted to, and is subject to the approval of, FSA. FSA shall use the technical determination of NRCS in approving this request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Impact of changing field boundaries.</E> When field boundaries are changed to include areas of land that were included in a field that was previously determined to be predominately highly erodible according to paragraph (a) of this section, such areas shall continue to be subject to the requirements for predominately highly erodible fields, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Small area of noncropland.</E> Small areas of noncropland within or adjacent to the boundaries of existing highly erodible crop fields such as abandoned farmsteads, areas around filled or capped wells, rock piles, trees, or brush which are converted to cropland are considered to meet the requirement of § 12.5(a)(2) if they are included in an approved conservation plan for the entire highly erodible field.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Conservation plans and conservation systems.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of field office technical guide.</E> A conservation plan or conservation system developed for the purposes of § 12.5(a) must be based on, and to the extent practicable conform with, the NRCS field office technical guide in use at the time the plan is developed or revised. For highly erodible croplands which were used to produce agricultural commodities prior to December 23, 1985, the applicable conservation systems in the field office technical guide are designed to achieve substantial reductions in soil erosion. Conservation systems shall be technically and economically feasible; based on local resource conditions and available conservation technology; cost-effective; and shall not cause undue economic hardship on the person applying the conservation system. Any conservation plans or systems that were approved prior to July 3, 1996, are deemed to be in compliance with this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Substantial reduction in soil erosion.</E> For the purpose of determining whether there is a substantial reduction in soil erosion on a field containing highly erodible cropland which was used to produce an agricultural commodity prior to December 23, 1985, the measurement of erosion reduction achieved by applying a conservation plan or system shall be based on a comparison of the estimated annual level of erosion that is expected to occur on that portion of the field for which a conservation plan or system was developed and is being applied, to the estimated annual level of erosion that existed on that same portion of the field before the application of a conservation plan or system. On a field that is converted from native vegetation after July 3, 1996, and where any crop production will result in increased erosion, in no case will the required conservation plan or system permit a substantial increase in erosion.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Field trials.</E> NRCS may allow a person to include in the person's conservation plan or a conservation system under the plan, on a field-trial basis, practices that are not currently approved but that NRCS considers have a reasonable likelihood of success. These trials must have prior approval by NRCS, and must be documented in the person's conservation plan specifying the limited time period during which the field trial is in effect. If, at the end of the conservation field trial period, NRCS finds that the practice does not meet conservation compliance <PRTPAGE P="414"/>requirements, the person will not be ineligible for USDA program benefits during the period of the field trial.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Highly erodible land previously under a Conservation Reserve Program contract.</E> Any person who owns or operates highly erodible land that was under a Conservation Reserve Program contract as authorized by section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, shall have 2 years after the expiration of termination of the contract to fully apply a conservation system if the conservation plan for such land requires the installation of structural measures for the production of an agricultural commodity. NRCS officials may extend this period one additional year for circumstances beyond the control of the person. The person shall not be required to meet a higher conservation standard than the standard applied to other highly erodible cropland located within the area served by the field office technical guide for the area in which the field is located.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Information regarding conservation options.</E> NRCS, in providing assistance to a person for the preparation or revision of a conservation plan under this part, will provide such person with information concerning cost-effective and applicable erosion control alternatives, crop flexibility, or other conservation assistance options that may be available.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Timely request for assistance.</E> Persons who require NRCS assistance for the development of a conservation plan or the installation of a conservation system are encouraged to request this assistance well in advance of deadline dates for compliance; otherwise the person may not be able to comply with these provisions and maintain eligibility for USDA program benefits.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Action by conservation districts.</E> Conservation districts approve or disapprove conservation plans or conservation systems after NRCS determines that the plans or systems conform to the NRCS field office technical guide. If a conservation district fails, without due cause, to act on a request for conservation plan or conservation system approval within 45 days, or if no conservation district exists, NRCS will approve or disapprove, as appropriate, the conservation plan or system in question.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Application of a conservation plan or system.</E> A person is considered to be applying a conservation plan for purposes of § 12.5(a) if the conservation system or plan being applied achieves or exceeds the substantial reduction in soil erosion as described in paragraph (b) which the conservation system or plan was designed to achieve. It is the responsibility of the person to:</P>
            <P>(1) Certify that the conservation plan or system is being applied; and</P>
            <P>(2) Arrange for a revision of the conservation plan with NRCS, if changes are made in land use, crop rotation or management, conservation practices, or in the original schedule of practice installation that would affect the achievement of substantial reduction in soil erosion in a given crop year.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal to FSA.</E> Persons who are adversely affected by the determinations made under this subpart and believe that the requirements of this subpart were improperly applied may appeal the decision to FSA under § 12.12.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Undue economic hardship.</E> After a technical determination has been made, the FSA county committee shall, if a person asserts that the application of the person's conservation system would impose an undue economic hardship on the person, make a recommendation to the State FSA Committee as to whether or not the application of the conservation system would impose an undue economic hardship. The State FSA Committee may provide the person with a variance on the basis of the hardship. Under this variance, and any conditions that may be required in the variance, the person will be considered to be in compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. The State FSA Committee will consider relevant factors, such as the cost of installation of required conservation practices and benefits earned through programs subject to compliance with this part, and the person's general economic situation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>NRCS responsibilities regarding wetlands.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Technical and coordination responsibilities.</E> In carrying out the provisions of this part, NRCS shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Oversee the development and application of criteria to identify hydric soils in consultation with the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils and make available to the public an approved county list of hydric soil map units, which is based upon the National List of Hydric Soils;</P>
            <P>(2) Coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and others in updating the National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands;</P>
            <P>(3) Make or approve wetland determinations, delineations and certifications, functional assessments, mitigation plans, categorical minimal effects, and other technical determinations relative to the implementation of the wetland conservation provisions of this part;</P>
            <P>(4) Develop and utilize off-site and on-site wetland identification procedures;</P>
            <P>(5) Assure quality of service and determinations through procedures developed by NRCS in consultation with other Federal agencies that have wetland responsibilities;</P>
            <P>(6) Investigate complaints and make technical determinations regarding potential violations;</P>
            <P>(7) Develop a process at the state level, in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to ensure that these provisions are carried out in a technically defensible and timely manner, seek assistance as appropriate, and annually review the progress being made on implementation; and</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical assistance from others</E> In carrying out the provisions of this part, NRCS may request technical assistance from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, State or local agencies, conservation districts, or qualified private entities when NRCS determines that additional staff resources or technical expertise are needed to address adequately the requirements of this part or to enhance the quality of implementation of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification of wetland determinations and wetland delineations.</E> (1) Certification of a wetland determination means that the wetland determination is of sufficient quality to make a determination of ineligibility for program benefits under § 12.4. In order for a map to be of sufficient quality to determine ineligibility for program benefits, the map document must be legible to the extent that areas that are determined wetland can be discerned in relation to other ground features. NRCS may certify a wetland determination without making a field investigation. NRCS will notify the person affected by the certification and provide an opportunity to appeal the certification prior to the certification becoming final. All wetland determinations made after July 3, 1996, will be done on a field or sub-field basis and will be considered certified wetland determinations. Determinations made after November 28, 1990, and before July 3, 1996, are considered certified if the determination was issued on the June 1991 version of form NRCS-CPA-026 or SCS-CPA-026, the person was notified that the determination had been certified, and the map document was of sufficient quality to determine ineligibility for program benefits. If issued on a different version of the form, a determination will be considered certified if there is other documentation that the person was notified of the certification, provided appeal rights, and the map document was of sufficient quality to make the determination.</P>
            <P>(2) The wetland determination and wetland delineation shall be certified as final by the NRCS official 30 days after providing the person notice of certification or, if an appeal is filed with USDA, after the administrative appeal procedures are exhausted.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of an appeal, NRCS will review and certify the accuracy of the determination of all lands subject to the appeal to ensure that the subject lands have been accurately delineated. Prior to a decision being rendered on the appeal, NRCS will conduct an on-site investigation of the subject land.</P>

            <P>(4) Before any benefits are withheld, an on-site investigation of a potential wetland violation will be made by <PRTPAGE P="416"/>NRCS. The affected person will be provided an opportunity to appeal the on-site determination to USDA if the on-site determination differs from the original determination. Such action by NRCS shall be considered a review of the prior determination and certification of the delineation. If the prior determination was a certified wetland determination, an appeal of the NRCS on-site determination shall be limited to the determination that the wetland was converted in violation of this part.</P>
            <P>(5) A copy of the information from the final certified wetland determination and the wetland delineation shall be recorded on official USDA aerial photography, digital imagery, or other graphic representation of the area.</P>
            <P>(6) As long as the affected person is in compliance with the wetland conservation provision of this part, and as long as the area is devoted to the use and management of the land for production of food, fiber, or horticultural crops, a certification made under this section will remain valid and in effect until such time as the person affected by the certification requests review of the certification by NRCS. A person may request review of a certification only if a natural event alters the topography or hydrology of the subject land to the extent that the final certification is no longer a reliable indication of site conditions, or if NRCS concurs with an affected person that an error exists in the current wetland determination.</P>
            <P>(7) The wetland determination process for wetland conservation compliance includes three distinct steps. In Step 1, wetland identification, it is determined if the area of interest supports a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation, a predominance of hydric soils, and wetland hydrology under normal circumstances. In Step 2, determination of wetland type, it is determined if any exemptions apply from § 12.5(b). The findings are reflected in the assignment of an appropriate wetland conservation compliance label. In Step 3, sizing of the wetland, the boundary of each wetland type determined in Step 2 is delineated on the certified wetland determination map.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Hydric soils.</E> (1) NRCS shall identify hydric soils through the use of published soil maps which reflect soil surveys completed by NRCS or through the use of on-site reviews. If a published soil map is unavailable for a given area, NRCS may use unpublished soil maps which were made according to the specifications of the National Cooperative Soil Survey or may conduct an on-site evaluation of the land.</P>
            <P>(2) NRCS shall determine whether an area of a field or other parcel of land has a predominance of hydric soils that are inundated or saturated as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) If a soil map unit has hydric soil as all or part of its name, that soil map unit or portion of the map unit related to the hydric soil shall be determined to have a predominance of hydric soils;</P>
            <P>(ii) If a soil map unit is named for a miscellaneous area that meets the criteria for hydric soils (i.e., riverwash, playas, beaches, or water) the soil map unit shall be determined to have a predominance of hydric soils; or</P>
            <P>(iii) If a soil map unit contains inclusions of hydric soils, that portion of the soil map unit identified as hydric soil shall be determined to have a predominance of hydric soils.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">List of hydric soils.</E> (i) Hydric soils are those soils which meet criteria set forth in the publication “Hydric Soils of the United States 1985” which was developed by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils and which is incorporated by reference. This publication may be obtained upon request by writing NRCS at U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013, and is available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

The materials are incorporated as they exist on the date of the approval and a notice of any change in these materials will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) An official list of hydric soil map units shall be maintained at the local NRCS office and shall include—</P>
            <P>(A) All soils from the National List of Hydric Soils that can be found in that field office area, and</P>
            <P>(B) Any soil map units or areas which the state conservationist determines to meet such hydric soil criteria.</P>
            <P>(iii) Any deletions of a hydric soil unit from the hydric soil map unit list must be made according to the established procedure contained in the publication “Hydric Soils of the United States 1985” for adding or deleting soils from the National List of Hydric Soils.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Hydrophytic vegetation.</E> Hydrophytic vegetation consists of plants growing in water or in a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen during a growing season as a result of excessive water content.</P>

            <P>(1) A plant shall be considered to be a plant species that occurs in wetland if such plant is listed in the National Wetland Plant List, or (as determined by NRCS) successor publication. The publication may be accessed at: <E T="03">http://rsgisias.crrel.usace.army.mil/NWPL/.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) For the purposes of the definition of “wetland” in § 12.2 of this part, land shall be determined to have a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation if:</P>
            <P>(i) NRCS determines through the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section that under normal circumstances such land supports a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation. The term “normal circumstances” refers to the soil and hydrologic conditions that are normally present, without regard to whether the vegetation has been removed; or</P>
            <P>(ii) In the event the vegetation on such land has been altered or removed, NRCS will determine if a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically exists in the local area on the same hydric soil map unit under non-altered hydrologic conditions.</P>
            <P>(3) The determination of prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation will be made in accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation methodology in use by NRCS at the time of the determination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Wetland Hydrology.</E> (1) Wetland Hydrology consists of inundation or saturation by surface or groundwater during a growing season at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation.</P>
            <P>(2) When a wetland is affected by drainage manipulations that occurred prior to December 23, 1985, wetland hydrology shall be identified on the basis of the best-drained condition resulting from such drainage manipulations.</P>
            <P>(3) The determination of wetland hydrology will be made in accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation methodology in use by NRCS at the time of the determination.</P>
            <P>(4) When making a decision on wetland hydrology, NRCS will utilize a fixed precipitation date range of 1971-2000 for determining normal climatic conditions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Mitigation wetlands.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, wetlands which are created in order to mitigate the loss of other wetlands as a result of irrigation, recreation, municipal water, flood control, or other similar projects shall not be considered to be artificial wetland for the purposes of § 12.5(b)(1)(vii)(A) of this part.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) <E T="03">Minimal effect determination.</E> For the purposes of § 12.5(b)(1)(v), NRCS shall determine whether the effect of any action of a person associated with the conversion of a wetland, the conversion of wetland and the production of an agricultural commodity on converted wetland, or the combined effect of the production of an agricultural commodity on a wetland converted by someone else has a minimal effect on the functions and values of wetlands in the area. Such determination shall be based upon a functional assessment of functions and values of the subject wetland and other related wetlands in the area. The assessment of functions and values of the subject wetland will be made through an on-site evaluation. Such an assessment of related wetlands in the area may be made based on a <PRTPAGE P="418"/>general knowledge of wetland conditions in the area. A request for such determination will be made prior to the beginning of activities that would convert the wetland. If a person has converted a wetland and then seeks a determination that the effect of such conversion on wetland was minimal, the burden will be upon the person to demonstrate to the satisfaction of NRCS that the effect was minimal.

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Scope of minimal-effect determination.</E> The production of an agricultural commodity on any portion of a converted wetland in conformance with a minimal-effect determination by NRCS is exempt under § 12.5(b)(1)(v). However, any additional action of a person that will change the functions and values of a wetland for which a minimal-effect determination has been made shall be reported to NRCS for a determination of whether the effect continues to be minimal. The loss of a minimal-effect determination will cause a person who produces an agricultural commodity on the converted wetland after such change in status to be ineligible, under § 12.4, for certain program benefits. In situations where the wetland values, acreage, and functions are replaced by the restoration, enhancement, or creation of a wetland in accordance with a mitigation plan approved by NRCS, the exemption provided by the determination will be effective after NRCS determines that all practices in a mitigation plan are being implemented.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Categorical Minimal Effect Exemptions.</E> (1) The state conservationist, in consultation with the state technical committee established under 16 U.S.C. 3861, shall identify any categories of conversion activities and conditions which are routinely determined by NRCS to have minimal effect on wetland functions and values, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and recommend to the Chief, NRCS, or a designee, inclusion on a list of categorical minimal effect exemptions.</P>
            <P>(2) The Chief, or designee, shall evaluate the conversion practices recommended by the state conservationists in the region to ensure consistency across State and regional lines, and to determine whether any categories of conversion activities identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if such activities were exempt from the ineligibility provisions of § 12.4, would only have a minimal effect on wetland functions and values in a wetland system within the region.</P>

            <P>(3) Any categories of conversion activities which meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(2) of this section will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for inclusion in this part and shall be exempt under § 12.5(b)(1)(v) of this part.</P>
            <P>(4) The NRCS local field office shall maintain a list of any activities and conditions which are determined by the Chief, or designee, exempt pursuant to this section and will provide the list to a person upon request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Converted wetland identification criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Converted wetland shall be identified by determining whether the wetland was altered so as to meet the definition of converted wetland. In making this determination, the following factors are to be considered:</P>
            <P>(1) Where hydric soils have been used for production of an agricultural commodity and the effect of the drainage or other altering activity is not clearly discernible, NRCS will compare the site with other sites containing the same hydric soils in a natural condition to determine if the hydric soils can or cannot be used to produce an agricultural commodity under natural conditions. If the soil on the comparison site could not produce an agricultural commodity under natural conditions, the subject wetland will be considered to be converted wetland.</P>
            <P>(2) Where woody hydrophytic vegetation has been removed from hydric soils for the purpose of or permitting the production of an agricultural commodity, the area will be considered to be converted wetland.</P>
            <P>(b) A wetland shall not be considered to be converted if:</P>

            <P>(1) Production of an agricultural commodity on such land is possible as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and it is determined that the actions of the person producing such <PRTPAGE P="419"/>agricultural commodity does not permanently alter or destroy natural wetland characteristics. Destruction of herbaceous hydrophytic vegetation (i.e., plants other than woody shrubs or trees) as a result of the production of an agricultural commodity shall not be considered as altering or destroying natural wetland characteristic if such vegetation could return following cessation of the natural condition which made production of the agricultural commodity possible; or</P>
            <P>(2) Such land is correctly identified as farmed wetland or farmed-wetland pasture.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 12.33</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Use of wetland and converted wetland.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The provisions of § 12.32(b)(2) are intended to protect remaining values, acreage, and functions of the wetlands described therein. Persons may continue to farm such wetlands under natural conditions or as they did prior to December 23, 1985. However, no action can be taken to increase effects on the water regime beyond that which existed on such lands on or before December 23, 1985, unless NRCS determines the effect on losing remaining wetland values would be minimal under § 12.5(b)(1)(v). If, after December 23, 1985, changes due to human activity occurred in the watershed and resulted in an increase in the water regime on a person's land, the person may be allowed to adjust the existing drainage system to accommodate the increased water regime on the condition that the person affected by this additional water provides NRCS with appropriate documentation of the increased water regime, the causes thereof, and the planned changes in the existing drainage system. In order to maintain program eligibility, a person must provide sufficient documentation and receive approval from NRCS prior to making any changes that will have the effect of increasing the capacity of the existing drainage systems.</P>
            <P>(b) Unless otherwise provided in this part, the production of an agricultural commodity on land determined by NRCS to be prior-converted cropland is exempted by law from these regulations for the area which was converted. Maintenance or improvement of drainage systems on prior-converted croplands are not subject to this rule so long as the prior-converted croplands are used for the production of food, forage, or fiber and as long as such actions do not alter the hydrology of nearby wetlands or do not make possible the production of an agricultural commodity on these other wetlands. Other wetlands under this section means any natural wetland, farmed wetland, farmed-wetland pasture, or any converted wetland that is not exempt under § 12.5 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Abandonment is the cessation for five consecutive years of management or maintenance operations related to the use of a farmed wetland or a farmed-wetland pasture. Unless the criteria for receiving an exemption under § 12.5(b)(1)(iii) are met, such land is considered to be abandoned when the land meets the wetland criteria of § 12.31. In order for documentation of site conditions to be considered adequate under § 12.5(b)(1)(iii), the affected person must provide to NRCS available information concerning the extent of hydrological manipulation, the extent of woody vegetation, and the history of use. In accordance with § 12.5(b)(1)(iii), participation in a USDA approved wetland restoration, set-aside, diverted acres, or similar programs shall not be deemed to constitute abandonment.</P>
            <P>(d) The maintenance of the drainage capacity or any alteration or manipulation, including the maintenance of a natural waterway operated and maintained as a drainage outlet, that affects the circulation and flow of water made to a farmed wetland or farmed-wetland pasture would not cause a person to be determined to be ineligible under this part, provided that the maintenance does not exceed the scope and effect of the original alteration or manipulation, as determined by NRCS, and provided that the area is not abandoned. Any resultant conversion of wetlands is to be at the minimum extent practicable, as determined by NRCS.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>

          <P>Federal tax, conservation, natural resource, and environmental policies <PRTPAGE P="421"/>should complement rather than conflict with one another. Therefore, the Federal income tax liability on applicable payments should be reduced or eliminated to the extent that the payments yield conservation, environmental, forestry improvement, or wildlife benefits to the general public beyond the benefits that accrue to those who receive the payments.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 14.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The portion of an applicable payment that may be excluded from gross income under part 14 shall be that portion or all, as appropriate, that—</P>
          <P>(1) Is determined to be made primarily for the purpose of conserving soil and water resources, protecting or restoring the environment, improving forests, or providing wildlife habitat; and</P>
          <P>(2) Is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as not increasing substantially the annual income derived from the property associated with the payment.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Primary purpose</E> means the principal, fundamental, predominant, or independent objective for which a payment is made. The following shall be considered in determining the primary purpose of a payment:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Single-purpose</E> payments shall be considered as having that purpose as their primary purpose.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Multiple-purpose payments.</E> If a payment is made for several purposes, it may be considered as having soil and water conservation, environmental protection or restoration, forestry improvement, or providing wildlife habitat as its primary purpose to the extent of the portion of the payment that is made for one or more of such purposes.</P>
          <P>(3) Where a purpose of a payment, or portion thereof, is in doubt, the following sources should be considered—</P>
          <P>(i) Authorizing legislation, legislative history, administrative regulation, administrative history, interpretive case law, and the administrative policies and procedures under which the applicable program operates and the payment is made; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Agreements or other documentation accompanying the transfer of the payment;</P>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for determining the primary purpose of payments with respect to potential exclusion from gross income.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Soil conservation.</E> (1) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of soil conservation if they are intended to finance activities, measures, or practices to reduce soil deterioration.</P>
          <P>(2) Soil deterioration refers to impairments of the physical or chemical properties of soil that are largely irreversible and that can be expected to result in a long-term or permanent reduction in the productive capacity of the resource regardless of the level of technology available or applied. Erosion by water and wind and the associated changes that result in permanent or long-term reductions in the productive capacity of the soil are forms of soil deterioration.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Water conservation.</E> (1) Water conservation includes actions that, for a given level of water supply, reduce the demand for or use of water by—</P>
          <P>(i) Improving efficiency in use;</P>
          <P>(ii) Reducing loss and waste;</P>
          <P>(iii) Increasing the recycling or reuse of water, thereby making existing supplies available for other current or future uses; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Improving land management practices for the purpose of reducing water use, loss, waste, increasing the efficiency of water use, or increasing the recycling or reuse of water.</P>
          <P>(2) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of water conservation if they are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices that can be expected to result in water conservation as defined in paragraph b(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Protecting the environment.</E> (1) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment if they are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices undertaken to prevent man-caused or man-induced reductions or degradations in the quantity or quality of the natural external or extrinsic conditions directly or indirectly affecting people.<PRTPAGE P="422"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) External or extrinsic conditions refer to the complex of natural conditions or circumstances, including but not limited to those affecting public health and safety, in which people reside or otherwise carry out their lives.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Restoring the environment.</E> (1) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of restoring the environment if they are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices undertaken to reestablish, return, or enhance the quantity or quality of the natural external or extrinsic conditions directly or indirectly affecting people that existed before the man-caused or man-induced degradation.</P>
          <P>(2) External or extrinsic conditions have the same meaning with respect to restoring the environment as they do for protecting the environment.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Improving forests.</E> (1) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of improving forests if they are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices undertaken for the direct or indirect conservation or enhancement of the quantity or quality of timber resources.</P>
          <P>(2) Improving forests includes the generation and regeneration of timber stands as well as the silvicultural improvement of such timber stands but excludes harvest cuttings not undertaken primarily for silvicultural improvement.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Providing habitat for wildlife.</E> (1) Payments shall be considered to be made primarily for the purpose of providing habitat for wildlife if they are intended to finance actions, measures, or practices leading directly to the establishment of those physical and biological conditions or resources that can be expected to support primarily noncultivated and nondomesticated animal and plant life. The animal and plant life must be of value to the public in their natural state apart from any value that may be realized from them as private economic gain.</P>
          <P>(2) Wildlife includes but is not limited to species of terrestrial or aquatic animals and plants.</P>
          <P>(3) Habitat includes, but is not limited to, the food supply, water supply, and nesting and escape cover necessary to support populations of wildlife species. Included in the definition of wildlife habitat are domestic crops raised for the primary purpose of providing food supply or cover for specific wildlife species.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Payments received through non-Federal programs under which payments are made primarily for the purpose of conserving soil and water resources, protecting or restoring the environment, improving forests, or providing a habitat for wildlife may be considered for exclusion from gross income under part 14.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the primary purpose of non-Federal payments.</E> The determination of the primary purpose for which non-Federal payments are made with respect to their potential for exclusion from gross income shall be made by using the criteria set forth in part 14 for determining the primary purpose of Federal payments.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure for determining the primary purpose of payments made under non-Federal programs.</E> (1) To initiate the process of determining the applicability of this part to payments received through non-Federal programs and the primary purpose of the payments for potential exclusion from gross income, the non-Federal official responsible for the program through which the payments are made should provide six copies of the following materials relating to the program to the Secretary of Agriculture—</P>
          <P>(i) Authorizing legislation;</P>
          <P>(ii) Rules or regulations;</P>
          <P>(iii) Current policies and procedures under which payments are made and used;</P>
          <P>(iv) A description of all practices or measures for which payments are made and used; and</P>

          <P>(v) Any other information that may be helpful in determining the purpose for which payments, or portions thereof, are made and used.<PRTPAGE P="423"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Any changes in the supporting documentation listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section, should be reported to the Secretary within 30 days of the date they become final.</P>

            <P>(a) The purpose of the regulations in this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of an applicant or recipient receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Agriculture or any Agency thereof.</P>

            <P>(b) The regulations in this part apply to any program or activity of an applicant or recipient for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department including, but not limited to, the Federal financial assistance listed in the appendix to this part. They apply to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to an applicant or recipient for its program or activity after the effective date of these regulations pursuant to an application approved or statutory or other provision made therefor prior to such effective date. The regulations in this part do not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part, (3) any assistance to an applicant or recipient who is an ultimate beneficiary, or (4) except as provided in § 15.3(c), any employment practice of any employer, employment agency or labor organization. The fact that a specific kind of Federal financial assistance is not listed in the appendix, shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such Federal financial assistance is not covered. Other Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice approved and issued by the Secretary and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Discrimination prohibited.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient to which these regulations apply. These regulations apply, but are not restricted, to unequal treatment in priority, quality, quantity, methods or charges for service, use, occupancy or benefit, participation in the service or benefit available, or in the use, occupancy or benefit of any structure, facility, or improvement.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient under any program to which the regulations in this part apply may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements on the ground of race, color, or national origin:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>

            <P>(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit, to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different <PRTPAGE P="426"/>manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>
            <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
            <P>(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege, enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
            <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provisions of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
            <P>(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.</P>
            <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any of its programs or activities to which the regulations in this part apply, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefit provided under a program or activity of an applicant or recipient receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any and all services, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided or improved in whole or part with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in these regulations does not limit the applicability of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</P>
            <P>(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color or national origin.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which the regulations in this part apply is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under the program including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities. This paragraph applies to programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (1) to reduce <PRTPAGE P="427"/>unemployment, (2) to assist individuals in meeting expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (3) to provide work experience which contributes to education or training. Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulations in this part, tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient to which these regulations apply, the foregoing provisions of this § 15.3(c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to these regulations, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any program or activity of the applicant or recipient shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples.</E> In order that all parties may have a clear understanding of the applicability of the regulations in this part to their activities, there are listed in this section types of Federal financial assistance together with illustrations, by way of example only, of types of activity covered by the regulations in this part. These illustrations and examples, however, are not intended to be all inclusive. The fact that a particular type of Federal financial assistance is not listed does not, of course, indicate that a program is not covered by the regulations in this part. Moreover, the examples set forth with respect to any particular listed type of Federal financial assistance are not limited to that program alone and the prohibited actions described may also be prohibited in other programs or activities whether or not listed below.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Cooperative Agricultural Extension Program.</E> (i) Discrimination in making available or in the manner of making available instructions, demonstrations, information, and publications offered by or through the Cooperative Extension Service;</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rural Electrification and Rural Telephone Programs.</E> (i) Refusal or failure by a borrower to accept applications for membership or applications to purchase shares of stock, or discrimination by a borrower in the terms and conditions of membership or stock ownership, where such membership or stock ownership is a condition prerequisite to the furnishing of electric or telephone service by the borrower, or to the receipt of any benefits or advantages related to such service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Refusal or failure by a borrower to extend, or discrimination by a borrower in the extension of, electric or telephone service to unserved persons;</P>
            <P>(iii) Denial by a borrower to any person of the benefits of improvement, expansion or upgrading, or discrimination by a borrower among consumers or subscribers in improving, expanding or upgrading, of electric or telephone service;</P>
            <P>(iv) Discrimination by a borrower in respect of rates, or terms or conditions of, service among consumers or subscribers;</P>
            <P>(v) Exclusion by a borrower of any member or stockholder, if the borrower is a cooperative or mutual type of corporation, from participation in any meeting of members or stockholders of the borrower, discrimination among its members or stockholders in respect of the exercise of any of their rights as members or stockholders, or in the manner of the exercise of such rights; or</P>

            <P>(vi) Exclusion by a borrower of any consumer or subscriber from, denial by a borrower to any consumer or subscriber of the use of, or discrimination by a borrower against any consumer or <PRTPAGE P="428"/>subscriber in his use of, any of the borrower's facilities.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which these regulations apply, except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility, shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the applicant's program or activity will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to the Act and the regulations in this part. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein, or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for <PRTPAGE P="430"/>the purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The Agency shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors, and subcontractors, successors in interest and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which was acquired through Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved through Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Agency to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the Agency concerned, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the purposes of the Federal financial assistance under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Agency may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Recipients other than applicants.</E> Each recipient not required to submit an application for Federal financial assistance, shall furnish, as a condition to the extension of any such assistance, an assurance or statement as is required of applicants under paragraphs (a), (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Elementary and secondary schools.</E> The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), or (d) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the said responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part within the earliest practical time. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.</P>

Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 15.4.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 15.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the requirements imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part.</P>

The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record.

An elementary or secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with § 15.4 (a), (b), or (d) shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it complies with the requirements of a § 15.4(e) and is otherwise in compliance with the Act and the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the Secretary to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Secretary determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Secretary denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes the denial to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure set forth in subpart C of this part. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing, that it has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

Thereafter, the proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with subpart A of this part and the rules of this subpart.

However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.

            <P>(2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.</P>

            <P>(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security <PRTPAGE P="470"/>for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, agree to forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

            <P>(b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>

A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.</P>

            <P>(b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 15b.8(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 15b.8(b), or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That (1) the recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary affirmative action efforts; and (2) the recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>

            <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient for conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That (1) all entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap; and (2) the results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded the same confidentiality as medical records except that:</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Accessibility.</E> A recipient shall operate each assisted program or activity so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Method.</E> A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of exiting facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 15b.19, or any other method that results in making its program or activity accessible to qualified handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve qualified handicapped persons in the most intergrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Small providers.</E> If a recipient with fewer than fifteen employees finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than by making a significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the handicapped person to other providers of those services that are accessible at no additional cost to handicapped persons.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Application for modification of requirements.</E> Recipients that determine after a self-evaluation conducted according to the requirements of § 15b.8(c), that accessibility can only be accomplished through substantial modifications which would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity, may apply to the Secretary for a modification of the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Historic Preservation Programs; Application for waiver of program accessibility requirements.</E> (1) A recipient shall operate each assisted program or activity involving Historic Preservation Programs so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing historic properties or every part of an historic property accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Methods of achieving accessibility include:</P>
            <P>(i) Making physical alterations which enable handicapped persons to have access to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;</P>
            <P>(ii) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;</P>
            <P>(iii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties;</P>
            <P>(iv) Adopting other innovative methods to achieve accessibility. Because the primary benefit of an Historic Preservation Program is the experience of the historic property itself, in taking steps to achieve accessibility, recipients shall give priority to those means which make the historic property, or portions thereof physicially accessible to handicapped individuals.</P>
            <P>(2) Where accessibility cannot be achieved without causing a substantial impairment of significant historic features, the Secretary may grant a waiver of the accessibility requirement. In determining whether accessibility can be achieved without causing a substantial impairment, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Scale of property, reflecting its ability to absorb alterations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private purpose;</P>
            <P>(iii) Importance of the historic features of the property to the conduct of the program or activity; and,</P>

            <P>(iv) Cost of alterations in comparison to the increase in accessibility.
              <PRTPAGE P="475"/>
            </P>
            <FP>The Secretary shall periodically review any waiver granted under this section and may withdraw it if technological advances or other changes so warrant.</FP>
            <P>(3) Where the property is federally owned or where Federal funds may be used for alterations, the comments of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation shall be obtained when required by section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), and 36 CFR part 800, prior to effectuation of structural alterations.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Time period.</E> A recipient shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part and as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within one year of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Identify the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's handicap.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appropriate education.</E> (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of §§ 15b.23, 15b.24, and ;15b.25.</P>
            <P>(2) Implementation of an Individualized Education Program developed in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) A recipient may place a handicapped person or refer such person for aid, benefits, or services other than those that it operates or provides as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subpart are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Free education</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> For the purpose of this section, the provision of a free education is the provision of educational and related services without cost to handicapped persons or their parents or guardians, except for those fees that are imposed on nonhandicapped persons or their parents or guardians. It may consist either of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a handicapped person in or refers such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, payment for the costs of the aid, benefits, or services. Funds available from any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Transportation.</E> If a recipient places a handicapped person or refers such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from aid, benefits, or services is provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the <PRTPAGE P="477"/>person or his or her parents or guardian if the person were placed in the program operated by the recipient.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Residential placement.</E> If a public or private residential placement is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person because of their handicap, the placement, including nonmedical care and room and board, shall be provided at no cost to the person or his or her parents or guardian.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Placement of handicapped persons by parents.</E> If a recipient has made available in conformance with the requirements of this section and § 15b.23, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person and the person's parents or guardian choose to place the person in a private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made a free appropriate education available or otherwise regarding the question of financial responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of § 15b.25.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> A recipient may not exclude any qualified handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after the effective date of this regulation.

A recipient shall place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment operated by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient that the education of the person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.

            <P>(1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their producer;</P>

            <P>(2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess <PRTPAGE P="478"/>specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and</P>
            <P>(3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Placement procedures.</E> In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement decisions, a recipient shall (1) draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical conditions, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to ensure that information obtained from all such sources is documented and carefully considered, (3) ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options, and (4) ensure that the placement decision is made in conformity with § 15b.23.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Reevaluation.</E> A recipient to which this section applies shall establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.</P>

            <P>(2) Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may include counseling services, physical education and athletics, food services, transportation, health services, recreational activities, special interest groups or clubs sponsored by the recipient, referrals to agencies which provide assistance to handicapped persons, and assistance in obtaining outside employment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Counseling services.</E> A recipient to which this subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Physical education and athletics.</E> (1) In providing physical education courses and athletics and similar aid, benefits, and services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates or sponsors interscholastic, club, or intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation.<PRTPAGE P="479"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A recipient may offer handicapped students physical education and athletic activities that are separate or different from those offered to nonhandicapped students only if separation or differentiation is consistent with requirements of § 15b.23, and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Food services.</E> In providing food services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. (1) Recipients shall serve special meals, at no extra charge, to students whose handicap restricts their diet. Recipients may require students to provide medical certification that special meals are needed because of their handicap.</P>

These methods may include meetings in accessible locations, home visits, written or telephonic communications, and other equally effective alternatives.</P>
            <P>(2) For aid, benefits, or services delivered at other publicly-owned facilities, recipients shall select accessible facilities wherever possible. If accessible facilities cannot be selected because they are unavailable or infeasible due to the nature of the activity, recipients shall use other methods to deliver aid, benefits, or services to qualified handicapped persons. These methods may include the redesign of activities or some sessions of activities, the provision of aides, home visits, or other equally effective alternatives.</P>
            <P>(3) For aid, benefits, or services delivered at privately-owned facilities, such as homes and farm buildings, recipients shall use accessible facilities whenever qualified handicapped persons requiring such accessibility are participating, have expressed an interest in participating, or are likely to participate. If accessible facilities cannot be selected because they are unavailable or infeasible due to the nature of the activity, recipients shall use other methods to deliver aid, benefits, or services to qualified handicapped persons. These methods may include the redesign of activities or some sessions of activities, the provision of aides, home visits, or other equally effective alternatives.</P>
            <P>(4) Recipients shall make camping activities accessible to qualified handicapped persons. Recipients are not required to make every existing camp, all existing camp facilities, or all camp sessions accessible, but recipients who operate more than one camp or session may not limit qualified handicapped persons to one camp or session.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Compliance reviews.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) USDA may conduct compliance reviews or use other similar procedures to review the activities of recipients to determine whether they are complying with the Age Act and this regulation and to investigate and address violations of the Age Act. USDA may conduct these reviews, at any time, even in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. The reviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violation of the Age Act or this regulation has occurred.</P>
          <P>(b) If a compliance review indicates a violation of the Age Act or this regulation, USDA shall attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with the Age Act. USDA shall monitor and evaluate a recipient's efforts to remedy a violation to ensure compliance consistent with applicable civil rights requirements until compliance has been achieved. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, USDA shall undertake enforcement of the Age Act and this regulation.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of complaints.</E> Any person who believes he/she or any specific class of individuals has been subject to discrimination by a recipient or believes that the recipient is otherwise in noncompliance with the provisions of the Age Act or this regulation may file a complaint with OASCR. The USDA Program Discrimination Complaint Form may be used to file a complaint.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of filing.</E> All age discrimination complaints alleging discrimination or noncompliance must be filed within 180 days of the last discriminatory act, to be timely.

          <P>(ii) Thirty days have elapsed after the head of the agency involved has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved.</P>
          <P>(3) An agency may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when termination proceedings under this paragraph (a) are initiated.</P>
          <P>(b) When an agency withholds funds from a recipient under this regulation, the Agency Head may disburse the withheld funds directly to any public or non-profit private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision of the State. These alternate recipients must demonstrate the ability to comply with this regulation and to achieve the goals of the Federal statute authorizing the Federal financial assistance.</P>

          <P>(c) No action shall be brought if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States. A complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint.</P>

          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 15e.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 15e.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods <PRTPAGE P="506"/>that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 15e.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by January 24, 1994, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by November 26, 1996, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by May 26, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Communications.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>

          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.<PRTPAGE P="507"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 15e.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do I request that USDA consider my complaint under these procedures?</SUBJECT>
            <P>In order for USDA to consider your complaint under these procedures, a Section 741 Complaint Request must be docketed with the Docketing Clerk in the USDA OCR.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Do I have to file a “Section 741 Complaint Request” if USDA is already working on my complaint? Do I have to file again?</E> If USDA OCR already reviewed or is working on your complaint, you will receive a notice by March 1, 1999, indicating that your complaint automatically has been docketed as a Section 741 Complaint Request for consideration under these procedures. The notice will provide you with the docket number assigned your Request and will give you further instructions with respect to what options you have or what actions you must take.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">What if USDA is not working on my complaint? If I think USDA has reviewed or is working on my complaint, but do not receive a letter by March 1, 1999, what should I do?</E> If USDA is not already working on your complaint, or you do not receive a letter from USDA by March 1, 1999, or within 30 days thereafter, you should file a Section 741 Complaint Request with the Docketing Clerk at USDA OCR.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">How long do I have to file my Section 741 Complaint Request?</E> You have until October 21, 2000 to file your Section 741 Complaint Request. If you did not receive a notice form USDA by October 21, 2000, that your Section 741 Complaint Request had been docketed automatically under paragraph (a) of this section, and you did not file a Section 741 Complaint Request prior to October 21, 2000, under paragraph (b) of this section, then any Section 741 Complaint Request received by USDA after October 21, 2000, will not be accepted.</P>

            <P>(b) If you are filing your Section 741 Complaint Request with USDA, and if you are represented by an attorney, your Section 741 Complaint Request should also include an authorization signed by you indicating that the attorney is entitled to represent you on your behalf.

            <P>The Director will review each Section 741 Complaint Request. If the Director finds that your complaint is an eligible complaint, the Director will: review all documents and evidence submitted by you; review all agency or CR files, if any exist, regarding the circumstances surrounding the alleged discrimination; review any damage claims; and seek any further clarification, if necessary, from either you or the agency. CR also may refer your eligible complaint for a formal investigation by the CR Program Investigation Division or by an outside contractor. Based on his or her review, the Director will either undertake negotiations with you to resolve the complaint; or inform you that CR will not settle the complaint and explain to you your options, including your right to request formal proceedings before an ALJ under subpart D of this part within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Director that CR will not settle the complaint. If the complaint is successfully resolved or settled, the Director will issue a final determination disposing of the matter. If you have received a notice that the Director will not settle the complaint prior to February 14, 2003, you have until 90 days after February 14, 2003 to request formal proceedings under subpart D of this part. Any request for formal proceedings received by USDA after the deadlines set forth in this section will not be accepted.</P>

However, if at any time the ALJ determines that your complaint is not an eligible complaint, he or she may dismiss your complaint with a final determination and USDA review of your complaint will then have been completed. You also are not entitled to a hearing if there are no material issues of fact in dispute between you and USDA.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">What are the powers of the ALJ?</E> The ALJ is responsible for conducting a hearing at your request on your Section 741 Complaint Request. He or she will have all powers prescribed in these rules and will make a proposed determination on your complaint. The proposed determination then will become the final determination after 35 days, unless the ASCR reviews the proposed determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">What is an ex parte communication?</E> An <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication is a communication by one party to a proceeding with the ALJ outside of the presence of, or without notice to, the other parties to a proceeding. <E T="03">Ex parte</E> communications in the proceedings on your complaint are prohibited and will be handled as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The ALJ will not engage in <E T="03">ex parte</E> communications regarding the merits of a complaint with any party or with any person having any interest in the proceedings on the complaint, including OCR and any person in an advocacy or investigative capacity, at any time between the assignment of a hearing to him or her and the issuance of a proposed determination. This prohibition does not apply to:</P>
            <P>(i) Discussions of procedural matters related to the complaint; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Discussions of the merits of the complaint where all parties to the proceeding on the complaint have been given notice and an opportunity to participate.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a communication described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a memorandum of any such discussion shall be included in the hearing record.</P>

            <P>(3) No party to the proceeding or other interested person shall make or knowingly cause to be made to the ALJ an <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication relevant to the merits of the complaint.</P>
            <P>(4) If the ALJ receives an <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication in violation of this section, the ALJ will place in the written record:</P>
            <P>(i) All such written communications;</P>
            <P>(ii) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and</P>
            <P>(iii) All written responses to such communications, and memoranda stating the substance of any oral responses to such communications.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party in violation of this section the ALJ may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy underlying these proceedings, require the party or other interested person making the communication to show cause why such party's claim or interest in the complaint should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.</P>

OCR also will file a report with the ALJ stating its position with respect to whether or not your complaint is an eligible complaint, with reasons for its position, as well as stating its position with respect to the merits of your complaint. OCR must turn over its file and make its report on its position on your complaint within 35 days. OCR must provide a copy to you of anything it provides to the ALJ.</P>

            <P>(a) At any time after the parties have been notified of your hearing request, you may file a request with the ALJ to make a determination based on the written record. With your request, you should file any other arguments or evidence that you wish the ALJ to consider. The agency and OCR will have 35 days after you file your request to file any additional information, arguments, or evidence for the consideration of the ALJ. The ALJ may recommend dismissal of your complaint on the basis of a finding that it is not an eligible complaint; recommend denial of your eligible complaint on the merits; or make a proposed finding of discrimination on your eligible complaint and recommend to award you such relief as would be afforded under the applicable statute or regulation under which the eligible complaint was filed. The ALJ will make a proposed determination on your complaint based on the original complaint, the Section 741 Complaint Request, the OCR report, and any other evidence or written documents filed by the parties. The proposed determination will become the final determination 35 days after it is filed unless you request review of the proposed determination by the ASCR. The ASCR also may review the proposed determination on his or her own initiative. If the ASCR reviews the decision, he or she will allow the parties a reasonable opportunity to file briefs in support of or opposition to the proposed determination, and afterwards will issue a final determination within 35 days after you request review of the proposed determination.</P>
            <P>(b) To the maximum extent practicable, a final determination will be made within 180 days of your filing of the Section 741 Complaint Request.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Will there be a pre-hearing conference?</E> The ALJ may hold a pre-hearing conference. If such a conference is to be held, the notice of the pre-hearing conference also will contain a notice to the parties of a time and date for the pre-hearing conference. Pre-hearing conferences normally will be held by telephone. Issues that may be addressed at the pre-hearing conference may include: simplification of the issues; the possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the authenticity of documents; limitation of the number of witnesses; exchange of copies of hearing exhibits; negotiation, compromise or settlement of issues; identification of documents of which official notice will be requested; a schedule for completion of the actions decided upon at the conference; and any other matters that may aid and expedite the conclusion of the proceeding.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">What else may the ALJ ask for before the hearing?</E> Prior to the hearing, the ALJ may require each of the parties to furnish any or all of the following: an outline of a party's position with respect to the complaint, the facts upon which the party intends to rely, the legal theories upon which the party intends to rely, copies of or a list of the documents and exhibits which the party anticipates on introducing at the hearing, and a list of anticipated witnesses.</P>

            <P>(b) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions will be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing agreement, by order of the ALJ.</P>
            <P>(c) No testimony taken by depositions will be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at the hearing, and ordinarily it will not be received into evidence if the deponent is present and can testify at the hearing. However, when the deponent is present and can testify, the deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given at the hearing. Where you have requested a final determination by the ALJ based on the written record without a hearing, the ALJ, in his or her discretion, may receive depositions to supplement the record.</P>

However, if there are circumstances in which additional parties have an interest in the proceeding, such as a bank which participated in a case involving a guaranteed loan, such other interested parties may be permitted to participate in the proceeding at the discretion of the ALJ.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Who may appear at the hearing?</E> You may appear at the hearing in person or through your attorney. OCR or the agency will appear through a designated representative, which may include a USDA attorney. Any person who appears as counsel must conform to the standards of ethical conduct required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">What happens if I fail to show up?</E> If, after having received notice of the hearing under § 15f.14, you fail to appear at the hearing without good cause, you will have waived your right to a hearing in the proceeding and the ALJ may proceed to issue a final determination based on the written record as provided for under § 15f.16.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Which party presents its case first at the hearing?</E> You, as the complainant, will proceed first at the proceeding, unless otherwise determined by the ALJ.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">What kind of evidence will be admitted and how will it be handled?</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The hearing will be conducted by the ALJ in the manner he or she determines most likely to obtain the facts relevant to the matter or matters at issue. The ALJ may confine the presentation of facts and evidence to pertinent matters and exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, information, or questions. Each party will have the opportunity to present oral and documentary evidence, oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments in support of the party's position; controvert evidence relied on by any other party; and question all witnesses. The testimony of witnesses at a hearing will be on oath or affirmation and will be subject to cross-examination. Any evidence may be received by the ALJ without regard to whether that evidence could be admitted in judicial proceedings. Upon a finding of good cause, the ALJ may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> (i) If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination or to any other ruling of the ALJ, the party <PRTPAGE P="515"/>must state briefly the grounds of such objection.</P>
            <P>(ii) Only objections made before the ALJ may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Depositions.</E> The deposition of any witness will be admitted in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of § 15f.18(c) of these rules.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Unless the ALJ finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, two copies of each exhibit must be filed with the ALJ. A party submitting an exhibit must provide every other party (except interested parties) a copy of the exhibit one week before the hearing. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Official records or documents.</E> An official government record or document or entry therein, if admissible for any purpose, will be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same, and will be <E T="03">prima facie</E> evidence of the relevant facts stated therein. Such record or document must be evidenced by an official publication thereof or a copy certified by a person having legal authority to make such certification.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice will be taken of such matters as are judicially noted by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character if the parties are given adequate notice of matters so noticed, and the parties will be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded by the ALJ, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which must be included in the transcript. The offer of proof should consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it must be included in the transcript in its entirety. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it must be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Interlocutory review.</E> Interlocutory review of rulings by the ALJ will not be permitted.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Transcript or recording.</E> (i) Hearings to be conducted by telephone will be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or by the personal attendance of parties and witnesses must be transcribed, unless the ALJ finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the ALJ orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The ALJ must certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(ii) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the ALJ determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the ALJ shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.</P>
            <P>(iii) The costs of transcription or verbatim recordings will be paid for by USDA and charged to the agency whose action gave rise to the complaint at issue. Copies of recordings or transcripts of hearings will be made available to any party at the actual cost of duplication.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When and in what form will a final determination be made on my complaint by USDA?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The ALJ will make a proposed determination orally at the close of a hearing, or in writing within 35 days. The ALJ may recommend dismissal of your complaint on the basis of a finding that it is not an eligible complaint; recommend denial of your eligible complaint on the merits; or make a proposed finding of discrimination on your eligible complaint and recommend to award you such relief as would be afforded under the applicable statute or regulation under which the eligible complaint was filed. The proposed determination will become the final determination 35 days after it is made, unless you request review of the proposed determination by the ASCR. The ASCR also may review the proposed determination on his or her own initiative. If the ASCR reviews the proposed determination, he or she will allow the parties a reasonable opportunity to file briefs in support or opposition to the proposed determination, and afterwards file a final determination within 35 days after you request review of the proposed determination.</P>
            <P>(b) To the maximum extent practicable, a final determination will be filed within 180 days after you filed your Section 741 Complaint Request.</P>

            <P>If you prevail on your eligible complaint, either in whole or in part, after a proceeding before an ALJ under the procedures in this subpart, you may be eligible for an award of attorneys fees as a prevailing party under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 5 U.S.C. 504. To get an EAJA award, you must file an application for such fees with the ALJ within 30 days after the final determination is made. Instructions for filing an EAJA application and obtaining an EAJA award are contained in 7 CFR part 1, subpart J. The ALJ must follow those rules, and not these Section 741 Complaint Request rules, in making any EAJA award.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and applicability.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to set forth USDA policy regarding equal opportunity for religious organizations to participate in USDA assistance programs for which other private organizations are eligible.</P>
          <P>(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this part, the policy outlined in this part applies to all recipients and subrecipients of USDA assistance to which 2 CFR part 400 applies, and to recipients and subrecipients of Commodity Credit Corporation assistance that is administered by agencies of USDA.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 16.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in this part:</P>

          <P>(a) USDA direct assistance is Federal financial assistance provided by USDA and means that the Federal Government or an intermediary (under this part) selects the provider and either purchases services from that provider (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via a contract) or awards funds to that provider to carry out a service (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via grant or cooperative agreement). In general, USDA assistance shall be treated as direct, unless it meets the definition of “USDA indirect assistance.”</P>
          <P>(b)(1) USDA indirect assistance is Federal financial assistance provided indirectly by USDA and means that the choice of the service provider is placed in the hands of the beneficiary, and the cost of that service is paid through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment. Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is considered “indirect” within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when</P>
          <P>(i) The government program through which the beneficiary receives the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment is neutral toward religion;</P>
          <P>(ii) The organization receives the assistance as a result of a decision of the beneficiary, not a decision of the government; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The beneficiary has at least one adequate secular option for the use of the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government-funded payment.</P>

          <P>(2) The recipients of sub-grants that receive Federal financial assistance through State-administered programs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> flow-through programs such as the National School Lunch Program authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. 1751 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) are not considered recipients of “USDA indirect assistance,” as those terms are used in Executive Order 13559. These recipients of sub-awards are considered recipients of USDA direct assistance.</P>

          <P>(c) Intermediary means an entity, including a non-governmental organization, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State or local government that accepts USDA direct assistance and distributes that assistance to other organizations that, in turn, provide government-funded services. If an intermediary, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State or local government that is administering a program supported by <PRTPAGE P="518"/>Federal financial assistance, is given the authority under the contract, grant, or agreement to select non-governmental organizations to provide services funded by the Federal Government, the intermediary must ensure compliance with the provisions of Executive Order 13559 and any implementing rules or guidance by the recipient of a contract, grant, or agreement. If the intermediary is a non-governmental organization, it retains all other rights of a non-governmental organization under the program's statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 16.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Rights of religious organizations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A religious organization is eligible, on the same basis as any other eligible private organization, to access and participate in USDA assistance programs. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving USDA assistance shall, in the selection of service providers, discriminate for or against a religious organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation. Additionally, decisions about awards of USDA direct assistance or USDA indirect assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of the religious affiliation of a recipient organization or lack thereof.</P>
          <P>(b) A religious organization that participates in USDA assistance programs will retain its independence and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use USDA direct assistance to support any explicitly religious activities, including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, a religious organization may:</P>
          <P>(1) Use space in its facilities to provide services and programs without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols,</P>
          <P>(2) Retain religious terms in its organization's name,</P>
          <P>(3) Select its board members and otherwise govern itself on a religious basis, and</P>
          <P>(4) Include religious references in its organizations' mission statements and other governing documents.</P>
          <P>(c) In addition, a religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, is not forfeited when an organization receives USDA assistance.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 16.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of participating organizations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any organization that participates in a program funded by USDA financial assistance shall not, in providing services, discriminate against a current or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.</P>
          <P>(b) Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance under any USDA program may not engage in explicitly religious activities, including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the programs or services supported with USDA direct assistance. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services supported with USDA direct assistance, and participation must be voluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or services supported with such USDA direct assistance.</P>

          <P>(c) Nothing in paragraphs (a) or (b) shall be construed to prevent religious organizations that receive USDA assistance under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. 1751 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1771 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> or USDA <PRTPAGE P="519"/>international school feeding programs from considering religion in their admissions practices or from imposing religious attendance or curricular requirements at their schools.</P>
          <P>(d)(1) USDA direct assistance may be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting USDA programs and activities and only to the extent authorized by the applicable program statutes and regulations. USDA direct assistance may not be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those structures are used by the USDA funding recipients for explicitly religious activities. Where a structure is used for both eligible and explicitly religious activities, USDA direct assistance may not exceed the cost of those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to USDA funds. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that an organization receiving direct assistance from USDA uses as its principal place of worship, however, are ineligible for USDA-funded improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the grant or any change in use of the property during the term of the grant is subject to government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (see 2 CFR part 400).</P>
          <P>(2) Any use of USDA direct assistance funds for equipment, supplies, labor, indirect costs, and the like shall be prorated between the USDA program or activity and any use for other purposes by the religious organization in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance.</P>
          <P>(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the residents of housing who are receiving USDA direct assistance funds from engaging in religious exercise within such housing.</P>
          <P>(e) USDA direct assistance under any USDA program may not be used for explicitly religious activities, speech, and materials generated or controlled by the administrators, instructors, or officials of the organization receiving USDA direct assistance.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Beneficiary protections: Written notice.</E> (1) Faith-based organizations that receive USDA direct assistance under any domestic USDA program must give written notice in a manner prescribed by USDA to all beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of their right to be referred to an alternate provider when available. The written notice must be given in a manner prescribed by USDA, and state that:</P>
          <P>(i) The organization may not discriminate against beneficiaries on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;</P>
          <P>(ii) The organization may not require beneficiaries to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;</P>
          <P>(iii) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;</P>
          <P>(iv) If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternate provider to which the prospective beneficiary has no objection; the organization may not be able to guarantee, however, that in every instance, an alternate provider will be available; and</P>
          <P>(v) Beneficiaries may report violations of these protections (including denials of services or benefits) by an organization to, USDA (or, the intermediary, if applicable).</P>
          <P>(2) This written notice must be given to beneficiaries prior to the time they enroll in the program or receive services from such programs. When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, service providers must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Beneficiary protections: Referral requirements.</E> If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of a domestic social services program supported by USDA <PRTPAGE P="520"/>objects to the religious character of an organization that provides services under the program, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternate provider, within reasonable geographic proximity to the provider, if available, to which the prospective beneficiary has no objection. In making the referral, the organization shall comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.</P>
          <P>(1) A referral may be made to another faith-based organization, if the beneficiary has no objection to that provider. But if the beneficiary requests a secular provider, and a secular provider is available, then a referral must be made to that provider.</P>
          <P>(2) Except for services provided by telephone, Internet, or similar means, the referral must be to an alternate provider that is in reasonable geographic proximity to the organization making the referral and that offers services that are similar in substance and quality to those offered by the organization, if one is available. The alternate provider also should have the capacity to accept additional clients, if one with capacity to accept additional clients is available.</P>
          <P>(3) If the organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternate provider, the organization shall promptly notify the awarding entity, and the awarding entity shall determine whether there is any other suitable alternate provider to which the beneficiary may be referred. An intermediary that receives a request for assistance in identifying an alternate provider may request assistance from USDA or a State or local government receiving USDA direct assistance.</P>
          <P>(4) In some cases, USDA may require that the awarding entity provide the organization with information regarding alternate providers. Such information regarding alternative providers should include providers (including secular organizations) within a reasonable geographic proximity that offer services that are similar in substance and quality and that would reasonably be expected to have the capacity to accept additional clients, provided any such organizations exist. An organization which relies on such information provided by the awarding entity shall be considered to have undertaken reasonable efforts to identify an alternate provider under this subpart.</P>
          <P>(h) The requirements in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section do not apply where USDA funds or benefits are provided to religious organizations as a result of a genuine and independent private choice of a beneficiary or through other indirect funding mechanisms, provided the religious organizations otherwise satisfy the requirements of the program.</P>

If the funds are comingled, the provisions of this part shall apply to all of the comingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to the USDA direct assistance.</P>

          <P>(3) If, in the shipping of commodities made available under title I, Pub. L. 480, a participant or importer uses an agent whose nomination has not been accepted in writing by the Deputy Administrator, Export Credits, FAS, USDA may withhold vessel approval or may deduct from the ocean freight differential to be paid, the amount of any commission to the agent in connection with the shipment.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">No competitive advantage.</E> A shipping agent may not take any action which would give a competitive advantage to any supplier of commodities or ocean transportation.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Commodity suppliers and selling agents.</E> (1) Commodity suppliers must be determined to be eligible under the Pub. L. 480, title I program in order for their contracts to be eligible for CCC financing. A prospective commodity supplier must be engaged in the business of selling agricultural commodities for export from the United States. The commodity supplier must maintain a bona fide business office in the United States, and must have a person, principal or agent on whom service of judicial process may be had in the United States.</P>
          <P>(2) Persons who wish to participate as commodity suppliers shall submit the following information to the Foreign Agricultural Service, Stop 1033, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250-1033:</P>
          <P>(i) A current financial statement of the prospective supplier, preferably an audited statement, as evidence of financial responsibility. Submission of a letter of reference from a bank is also encouraged.</P>
          <P>(ii) A statement containing general background information about the firm, including the names and titles of the chief executive officers and a description of the firm's experience as an exporter of U.S. agricultural commodities. Copies of bills of lading supporting this statement are also requested.</P>
          <P>(iii) Any other information requested relating to whether the prospective supplier is responsible and is able to perform its obligations under this part and the purchase authorization.</P>
          <P>(3) If, at the time the commodity supplier reports the sale it is determined that an agent employed or engaged by a commodity supplier to obtain a contract is not a selling agent as defined in § 17.2, the sale will not be eligible for financing.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility for financing.</E> To be eligible for financing, commodity contracts must comply with the following requirements unless otherwise specified in the purchase authorization.</P>
          <P>(1) Commodity contracts between suppliers and importers are considered to be conditioned on the approval by USDA of the contract price; conformance of the sale to the provisions of the purchase authorization; responsiveness of the offer to IFB terms; and compliance by the supplier and the selling agent, if any, with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

          <P>(2) Importers and suppliers must enter into contracts within the contracting period specified in the purchase authorization. The contracts must provide for deliveries to the importer in accordance with the delivery terms and during the delivery period specified in the purchase authorization, or any amendment or modification thereto.<PRTPAGE P="528"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Contracts for a commodity, under a purchase authorization which limits delivery terms to f.o.b. or f.a.s., must be separate and apart from the contracts for ocean transportation of the commodity.</P>
          <P>(4) The supplier's sales price may not exceed the prevailing range of export market prices as applied to the terms of sale at the time of sale, as determined by USDA. The “time of sale” is the date and time specified in the IFB for receipt of offers; or the date of the contract amendment if the amendment affects the sale price, as determined by USDA. The contract price may not be on a cost plus a percentage-of-cost basis.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Purchasing—general.</E> (i) Importers must purchase commodities on the basis of IFB's.</P>
          <P>(ii) The participant shall maintain a record of all offers received from suppliers until the expiration of three years after final payment under contracts awarded under the purchase authorization. The GSM may examine these records or request specific information in connection with the offers.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Invitations for bids.</E> The following conditions shall apply on all purchases of commodities on the basis of IFB's:</P>
          <P>(i) The General Sales Manager must approve the terms of the IFB before it is issued by the importer.</P>
          <P>(ii) The importer shall issue the IFB in the United States and shall open all offers in public in the United States at the time and place specified in the IFB.</P>
          <P>(iii) The IFB must permit submission of offers from all suppliers who meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
          <P>(iv) The IFB may not preclude offers for shipment from any United States port(s) unless the purchase authorization provides for exportation only from certain ports.</P>
          <P>(v) The IFB may not establish minimum quantities to be offered or which will be considered.</P>
          <P>(vi) The IFB must stipulate the responsibility for each party for payment of any costs not eligible for financing by CCC.</P>
          <P>(vii) The IFB must be in compliance with this part, the purchase authorization, and sound commercial standards.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Contract awards.</E> (i) The importer shall consider only offers which are responsive to the IFB and shall make awards either on the basis of the lowest commodity price(s) offered or on the basis of lowest landed cost. However, when vessels offered under the flag of the participant, the importing country or the destination country; or vessels controlled by the participant, the importing country or the destination country are to be used, the participant must purchase commodities for shipment on such vessels only on the basis of the lowest commodity price(s) offered. This limitation may, however, be waived by the GSM:</P>
          <P>(A) When the lowest commodity price(s) offered are in locations where vessels cannot reasonably be made available without a substantial increase in freight costs to the participant;</P>
          <P>(B) For small quantities offered at additional loading points (in aggregate not more than 15 percent of the total tonnage offered by a vessel); or</P>
          <P>(C) Where this limitation would conflict with the purposes of the program.</P>
          <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, “lowest commodity price(s)” means the lowest commodity price(s) offered for loading onto the type of vessel (dry bulk carrier, tanker, etc.) to be utilized to carry the commodity purchased.</P>
          <P>(iii) For purposes of this section, “lowest landed cost” means the combination of commodity price and ocean freight rate resulting in the lowest total cost to deliver the commodity to the importing country, considering the quantity which must be shipped on privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels, as determined by the Director. Lowest landed cost may be defined on either a foreign flag or U.S. flag basis. Awards may not be made on the lowest landed cost basis unless IFB's are issued for commodity and ocean freight so that all commodity and ocean freight offers are reviewed simultaneously.</P>

          <P>(iv) Participants are encouraged to purchase commodities on the basis of lowest landed cost when U.S. flag vessels are to be used. If such commodity purchases are not made on the basis of lowest landed cost (U.S. flag), ocean freight differential payments will <PRTPAGE P="529"/>nonetheless be calculated on the rates of U.S. flag vessels which would represent the lowest landed cost.</P>
          <P>(v) Announcement of awards shall be made in the United States. The importer shall promptly submit to the Director copies of all offers received with a copy of the IFB which was issued. No sale can be approved for financing until this information has been received by FAS. The decision of the GSM shall be final regarding the responsiveness of offers to IFB terms in the awarding of contracts.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Contract quantity eligible for financing.</E> The quantity eligible for financing in the contract between the supplier and the importer may not exceed that quantity approved by the Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS, including any approved contract tolerance.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Contract disputes.</E> Contracts between suppliers and importers should stipulate the responsibility of each party for payment of any costs not eligible for financing by CCC. Questions as to payment of ineligible costs should be resolved between the contracting parties.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Contract provisions.</E> Each contract entered into for financing under this part is deemed to include all terms and conditions required by the regulations in this part.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Export Trade Act</E> (<E T="03">Webb-Pomerene Law</E>). A supplier who is a member of a Webb-Pomerene association and who enters into contracts with importers as a member of such an association shall so indicate in a statement on, or attached to, the copy of the supplier's detailed invoice referred to in § 17.9(c)(2).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 17.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Discounts, fees, commissions and payments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>For purposes of this section, the term “payment” means a commission, fee or other compensation of any kind. The term “other compensation of any kind” includes anything given in return for any consideration, services, or benefits received or to be received.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Discounts.</E> If a contract provides for one or more discounts (including but not limited to trade or quantity discounts and discounts for prompt payment) whether expressed as such or as “commissions” to the importer, CCC will only pay the invoice amount after the discount (supplier's contracted price less all discounts).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Selling agents.</E> (1) A supplier may not make a payment to a selling agent employed or engaged by the supplier to obtain a contract. This prohibition applies to any payment to a person who has acted as a selling agent to obtain a contract even though the payment may be for services performed that are not themselves services to obtain a contract.</P>
          <P>(2) A person is deemed to act “to obtain a contract” if the person acts on behalf of a commodity supplier to:</P>
          <P>(i) Influence a buyer to award a contract to the supplier;</P>
          <P>(ii) Give the supplier a competitive advantage in relation to other potential suppliers; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Influence CCC to approve a contract for financing under this part.</P>
          <P>(3) CCC will not consider acts which are purely ministerial in nature and do not require the exercise of personal influence, judgment, or discretion (such as attending bid openings or presenting offers at bid openings), or services to implement a contract after it has been entered into by the parties (such as handling documentation problems or contract disputes), as acts to obtain a contract.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Other prohibitions.</E> (1) Suppliers of commodities or ocean transportation may not:</P>
          <P>(i) Pay a commission to the participant or importer; to any agency, including an agency of the government of the importing country or the destination country; or to a corporation owned or controlled by the participant or the government of the importing country or the destination country.</P>
          <P>(ii) Pay a commission to any affiliate of the participant, if the participant is a private entity;</P>
          <P>(iii) Make any payment to an agent of the participant or importer, in the person's capacity as such agent, other than ocean transportation brokerage commissions.</P>
          <P>(iv) Pay an address commission or payment.</P>
          <P>(2) For ocean transportation, in addition to this paragraph, see also § 17.8(j).</P>

          <P>(3) When any portion of the ocean freight is financed by CCC, total ocean <PRTPAGE P="530"/>transportation brokerage commissions earned on U.S. and non-U.S.-flag bookings by all parties arranging vessel fixtures shall not exceed 2<FR>1/2</FR> percent of the total freight costs.</P>
          <P>(4) If a payment is made in violation of this section, CCC may demand dollar refund of the entire amount financed by CCC under the contract.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 17.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Notice of sale procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Telephonic notice of sale.</E> The supplier shall, immediately upon making a firm sale, telephone a notice of sale to Pub L. 480 Operations Division, FAS. A sale is considered firm when the supplier has been notified by the importer of an award, even though the contract is conditioned on approval by FAS (see § 17.5(b)(1).) If the supplier fails to furnish a notice of sale within 3 working days after the date of sale, CCC has the right to refuse to finance the sale.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Sale approval.</E> (1) Pub. L. 480 Operations Division will notify the supplier by telephone of approval of the notice of sale.</P>
          <P>(2) The supplier will prepare Form FAS-359, “Declaration of Sale,” and submit it to Pub. L. 480 Operations Division promptly as soon as FAS has provided the CCC Registration Number to the supplier. The supplier or the supplier's authorized representative must sign the form.</P>
          <P>(3) Each Form FAS-359 shall cover only a single sale contract. If a sale is made under two or more purchase authorizations, the supplier will prepare separate forms for each purchase authorization.</P>
          <P>(4) If any correction is needed to the Form FAS-359, the supplier must immediately notify FAS. If a contract is amended, the supplier should present the original Form FAS-359 for payment along with a copy of the written USDA approval of the contract amendment.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Sale disapproval.</E> (1) Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS, will notify the supplier by telephone when a sale is disapproved for financing. The related contract between the supplier and importer shall, for purposes of financing, be considered null and void.</P>
          <P>(2) On receipt of a notice of disapproval, the supplier shall promptly notify the importer.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Contract delivery period.</E> Price approval is limited to exports made during the delivery period stated in the notice of sale or any contract amendment approved by the Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS. If the supplier cannot complete delivery by the terminal delivery date of the contract delivery period, the supplier and the participant or importer shall submit a notice of contract amendment as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If the supplier fails to comply, § 17.10(d) shall apply.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Contract amendments.</E> (1) The supplier and the participant or importer shall each submit a written notice of each contract amendment to the Director immediately after the amendment to the contract is made. This includes not only any change in the contract delivery period or any other terms and conditions of the contract as provided in the information given in the original notice of sale or any amendment thereto, but also any change in any other terms and conditions of the contract.</P>
          <P>(2) The notice of contract amendment must contain the following:</P>
          <P>(i) A request that USDA approve an amendment to the specifically identified sale contract between (the participant or importer) and (the commodity supplier).</P>
          <P>(ii) A statement of what the amendment consists of (as, extension of delivery period through (date)) and a detailed explanation of the reasons for the amendment.</P>
          <P>(iii) A statement that the contract amendment has been agreed to by both buyer and seller.</P>
          <P>(3) Pub. Law 480 Operations Division, FAS, will notify the supplier as to whether the amendment is approved or disapproved.</P>
          <P>(4) The supplier shall furnish a copy of the USDA approval of the amendment with other documentation submitted to obtain payment.</P>

          <P>(5) If the supplier fails to furnish notice of a contract amendment to Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS, within 3 working days after the date of such amendment, CCC has the right to refuse to finance the sale or any portion of the sale.<PRTPAGE P="531"/>
          </P>
          <P>(6) Any amendment must be consistent with the provisions of the purchase authorization and this part and must otherwise be acceptable to Pub. L. 480 Operations Division, FAS.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 17.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Ocean transportation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This section applies to the financing of ocean freight or ocean freight differential. Ocean freight will be financed by CCC only to the extent specifically provided for in the purchase authorization. The purchase authorization may provide requirements in addition to or in lieu of those specified in this section.</P>
          <P>(2) The supplier of ocean transportation must be engaged in the business of furnishing ocean transportation from the United States and must have a person, principal or agent, on whom service of judicial process may be had in the United States.</P>
          <P>(3) The quantity of the commodity which must be shipped on privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels will be determined by the Director.</P>
          <P>(4) The supplier of ocean transportation shall release copies of the ocean bills of lading to the supplier of the commodity promptly upon completion of loading of the vessel.</P>
          <P>(5) When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight or the ocean freight differential, the participant must open an operable irrevocable letter of credit for the portion of the ocean freight not financed by CCC. All banking institution charges, such as commissions, expenses, etc., are for the account of the participant. The amount of the letter of credit shall be computed using the information provided in the Form CCC-106. The letter of credit shall provide for sight payment or acceptance of a draft, payable in U.S. dollars, on the basis of the quantities specified in the applicable ocean freight contract. If the supplier of ocean transportation accepts the commodity before receipt of an acceptable letter of credit from a bank, the supplier takes such action at its own risk. This action in itself does not affect eligibility for CCC financing.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Contracting procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Invitations for Bids</E> (<E T="03">IFB's</E>). (i) Public freight “Invitations for Bids” are required in the solicitation of freight offers from all U.S. and non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is financing any portion of the ocean freight.</P>
          <P>(ii) For non-U.S. flag vessels when CCC is not financing any portion of the ocean freight, public freight IFB's are also required unless otherwise authorized by the Director, or unless the participant requires the use of vessels under its flag, the flag of the destination country, or other non-U.S. flag vessels under its control. Vessels considered to be under the control of the participant or the destination country include vessels under time charters, bare boat charters, consecutive voyage charters, or other contractual arrangements for the carriage of commodities which provide guaranteed access to vessels.</P>
          <P>(iii) Prior to release to the trade, all freight IFB's must be submitted to the Director for approval. Freight IFB's must be issued by means of Bridge News, New York, plus at least one other means of communication.</P>
          <P>(iv) All freight IFB's must:</P>
          <P>(A) Specify a closing time for the receipt of offers and state that late offers will not be considered;</P>
          <P>(B) Provide that offers are required to have a canceling date no later than the last contract layday specified in the IFB;</P>
          <P>(C) Provide the same deadline for receipt of offers from both U.S. flag vessels and non-U.S. flag vessels;</P>
          <P>(D) Stipulate the responsibility for each party for payment of any costs not eligible for financing by CCC (in the IFB or the pro forma charter party).</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Competitive bidding.</E> When CCC is financing any portion of the freight, all offers shall be opened in public in the United States at the time and place specified in the IFB. Offers shall be opened prior to receipt of offers for the sale of commodities as the Director determines appropriate. Only offers which are responsive to the IFB may be considered, and no negotiation shall be permitted.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Records of offers.</E> Copies of all offers received must be promptly furnished to the Director, who may require the participant, or its shipping agent, to submit a written certification to the GSM that all offers received (with the times of receipt designated <PRTPAGE P="532"/>thereon) were transmitted to the Department. For purposes of this paragraph “time of receipt” shall be the time a hand-carried offer or a mailed offer was received at the designated location for presentation or, if transmitted electronically, the time the offer was received, as supported by evidence satisfactory to the Director.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Re-tenders.</E> The Director may permit or require a participant to refuse any and all bids, and in such case a participant may conduct a re-tender with the approval of the Director. The Director shall not approve or require freight re-tenders unless they will increase the likelihood of meeting U.S. flag cargo preference requirements, will permit the desired quantity to be shipped, will likely result in reduced CCC expenditures, or are otherwise determined to be in the best interest of the program.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for vessel approval.</E> The pertinent terms of all proposed charters and all proposed liner bookings, regardless of whether any portion of ocean freight is financed by CCC, must be submitted to the Director for review and approval before fixture of the vessel. Tentative advance vessel approvals may be obtained by telephone provided Form CCC-105, “Ocean Shipment Data—Pub. L. 480 (Request for Vessel Approval)”, is furnished promptly confirming the information supplied by telephone. The Form CCC-105 shall be submitted in duplicate to the Director.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Advice of vessel approval.</E> (1) USDA will give written approval of charters and liner bookings on Form CCC-106, “Advice of Vessel Approval.” The Form CCC-106 will state whether CCC will finance any part of the ocean freight. For f.a.s. or f.o.b. shipments, CCC will issue a signed original of Form CCC-106 to the ocean carrier when CCC finances any part of the ocean freight. For c.&amp; f. or c.i.f. shipments, CCC will issue Form CCC-106 to the supplier of commodity.</P>
          <P>(2) If CCC agrees to finance any portion of the ocean freight, the participant or its agent shall forward a copy of the ocean freight contract immediately after execution to the Director for review and approval prior to issuance of Form CCC-106.</P>
          <P>(3) CCC may also require the supplier of ocean transportation to submit copies of lightening, stevedoring, or bagging contracts for any voyage for which CCC finances ocean freight or ocean freight differential.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Special charter party provisions required when any part of ocean freight is financed by CCC.</E> This paragraph applies when CCC finances any part of the ocean freight for commodities booked on charter terms. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the regulations in this part and the charter party or ocean bills of lading issued pursuant thereto, the provisions of the regulations in this part shall prevail. The charter party shall contain or, for the purpose of financing pursuant to the regulations in this part, be deemed to contain the following provisions:</P>
          <P>(1) That if there is any failure on the part of the supplier of ocean transportation to perform the charter party after the vessel has tendered at the loading port, the charterer shall be entitled to incur all expenses which in the judgment of the General Sales Manager are required to enable the vessel to carry out her obligations under the charter party including, but not limited to, expenses for lifting any liens asserted against the vessel.</P>
          <P>(2) That, notwithstanding any prior assignments of freight made by the owner or operator, the expenses authorized in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be deducted from the freight earned under the charter party.</P>
          <P>(3) That ocean freight is earned and that 100% thereof is payable by the charterers when the vessel and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, subject to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and to the further condition that if a force majeure as described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section results in the loss of part of the vessel's cargo, 100% of the ocean freight is payable on the part so lost. This provision does not relieve the carrier of the obligation to carry to other points of discharge if so required by the charter party.</P>

          <P>(4) That if a force majeure as described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section prevents the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge, the freight shall be payable by the charterer at the time the General Sales Manager determines that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival.<PRTPAGE P="533"/>
          </P>
          <P>(5) That laydays are non-reversible.</P>
          <P>(6) That in a dispute involving any rights and obligations of CCC, including rights and obligations as successor or assignee, which cannot be settled by agreement, the dispute shall not be subject to arbitration.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Special charter party information required when any part of ocean freight is financed by CCC.</E> When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight for commodities booked on charter terms, the charter party shall contain the following information:</P>
          <P>(1) The name of each party participating in the ocean freight brokerage commission, if any, and the percentage thereof payable to each party;</P>
          <P>(2) The name of the vessel and the name of the substitute vessel, if any.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of arrival.</E> Each Form CCC-106 will indicate whether a notice of arrival is required. A notice of arrival, when required, must be furnished promptly by the participant or its designated agent or other source acceptable to CCC (excluding the carrier or its agent) and must include the name of the vessel, the purchase authorization number, the first port of discharge, and the date of arrival. The notice of arrival of the vessel also constitutes prima facie evidence of arrival of the cargo.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Foreign flag vessels.</E> The cost of ocean transportation will be financed by CCC on non-U.S. flag vessels only when, and to the extent, specifically provided in the applicable purchase authorization.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">U.S.-flag vessels.</E> When a commodity is required to be shipped on a privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessel, Form CCC-106 will set forth:</P>
          <P>(1) The rate of the ocean freight differential, if any, which the Director determines to exist between the prevailing foreign-flag vessel rate and the U.S.-flag vessel rate; and</P>
          <P>(2) The approximate tonnage for which CCC will authorize reimbursement of ocean freight or ocean freight differential, as appropriate.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Items not eligible for financing by CCC.</E> The following costs will not be financed by CCC, either separately or as part of the commodity contract price:</P>
          <P>(1) Loading, trimming, and other related shipping expenses unless included in the ocean freight rate;</P>
          <P>(2) Discharge costs unless included in the ocean freight rate;</P>
          <P>(3) The cost of “dead freight”;</P>
          <P>(4) Cargo dues and taxes assessed by the importing or recipient country;</P>
          <P>(5) Surcharges assessed by steamship conferences or carriers, unless specifically authorized by the Director;</P>
          <P>(6) General average contributions;</P>
          <P>(7) Stevedoring overtime and vessel crew overtime;</P>
          <P>(8) Ship's disbursements;</P>
          <P>(9) Any payments prohibited in § 17.6 (b) and (c); and</P>
          <P>(10) Detention.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">General financing provisions.</E> When any part of ocean freight will be financed either separately or as part of the commodity contract price, the following shall apply:</P>
          <P>(1) Ocean freight contracts must show the ocean freight rate from one loading port to one discharge port, and may provide for an increase in rate for an additional port of loading or discharge, or other option. CCC, however, will finance initially the lowest such rate or OFD, as appropriate. Increased amounts due because of the exercise of such option will be financed only after receipt of an ocean bill of lading or other evidence showing that the option was exercised.</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of transshipment to a foreign flag vessel, CCC will finance the ocean freight or OFD, as appropriate, only to the point of transshipment, at a rate determined by the GSM, and CCC will not finance any part of the ocean freight beyond the point of transshipment unless specifically approved by the GSM. If the commodity was transported from a U.S. port and was transshipped at another U.S. port, CCC will not finance, without prior approval of the GSM, any part of the ocean freight incurred before transshipment.</P>

          <P>(3) The ocean freight rate eligible for CCC financing and the rate used for the U.S.-flag vessel in calculating ocean freight differential shall not exceed the following rates for the category of the vessel concerned:<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) For commodities covered by published tariff rates—the published conference contract rate;</P>
          <P>(ii) For other commodities—the market rate prevailing at the time of request for approval as determined by the Director, but in any event not in excess of rates charged other shippers (irrespective of booking dates) for like commodities on the voyage concerned.</P>
          <P>(4) Payment will be made for ocean freight or OFD, as appropriate, from loading points to discharge points at rates approved by the Director on Form CCC-106 in conformity with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) Freight for a vessel designated on Form CCC-106 as a U.S. flag vessel shall not be eligible for financing unless such vessel complies with the provisions of Pub. L. 87-266.</P>
          <P>(6) Ocean freight contracts must specify that the participant shall be liable for detention of the vessel for loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the supplier of ocean transportation not to commence loading because of the failure of the participant to establish an ocean freight letter of credit in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. However, ocean freight contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean transportation supplier shall be entitled to reimbursement for detention costs for all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the designated loading port within the laydays specified in the ocean freight contract, and upon notification of the vessel's readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the applicable ocean freight contract. The period of such delay shall end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit have been established for the applicable ocean freight or the time the vessel begins loading, whichever is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.</P>
          <P>(l) <E T="03">Force majeure.</E> (1) The GSM will waive the requirement for the notice of arrival required by Form CCC-106 by a written notice to the supplier of ocean transportation on the receipt of evidence satisfactory to the General Sales Manager that the vessel is lost or unable to proceed to destination after completion of loading as a result of one or more of the following causes: Damage caused by perils of the sea or other waters; collisions; wrecks; stranding without the fault of the carrier; jettison; fire from any cause; Act of God; public enemies or pirates; arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or peoples without the fault of the supplier of ocean transportation; wars; public disorders; captures; or detention by public authority in the interest of public safety. The supplier may substitute such waiver for the notice of arrival.</P>
          <P>(2) The determination of a force majeure by the GSM shall not relieve the participant from its obligation under the Agricultural Commodities Agreement to pay CCC, when due, the dollar amount of ocean freight, plus interest (exclusive of ocean freight differential), financed by CCC.</P>
          <P>(m) <E T="03">Demurrage/despatch.</E> CCC will not finance demurrage and CCC will not share in despatch earnings. Owners and commodity suppliers will settle laytime accounts at load port(s) and owners and charterers will settle laytime accounts at discharge port(s). Under no circumstances shall CCC be responsible for resolving disputes involving calculation of laytime or the payment of demurrage or despatch.</P>
          <P>(n) <E T="03">Ocean freight included in the commodity contract price.</E> For cost and freight or c.i.f. contracts the ocean freight, or the ocean freight differential, as appropriate, will be financed only to the extent specifically provided in the applicable purchase authorization.</P>
          <P>(o) <E T="03">Separate freight contracts.</E> Contracts for ocean transportation, under a purchase authorization which limits delivery terms to f.o.b. or f.a.s., must be separate and apart from the contracts for the commodity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in these regulations and in all instructions, forms, and documents pertaining hereto, the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning assigned to them as follows:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrator.</E> The Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Buy-back contract.</E> A transaction under which a reporting exporter having sold a commodity for export to a foreign buyer liquidates the export sale contract by making an offsetting purchase of the same kind of commodity from the same foreign buyer.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Commodity.</E> Wheat and wheat flour, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, rice, cattle hides and skins, beef and pork, and any products thereof, and any other agricultural commodity the Secretary may designate. “Commodity” shall also mean a commodity having identifying characteristics as described in any announcement issued pursuant to § 20.5 such as class(es) of wheat and rice, or staple length(s) of cotton. Mixed wheat shall be considered to be the predominant wheat class of the blend. This definition excludes commodities to be used for seed which have been treated in such a manner that their use is limited to seed for planting purposes or on which a certificate has been issued by a recognized seed testing laboratory setting forth variety, germination and purity.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Country of destination.</E> (1) Any country outside the United States or (2) any territory or possession of the United States. Country of destination shall be the ultimate destination of the export, and shall not be deemed to be the country through which any transshipment takes place.<PRTPAGE P="542"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Export.</E> A shipment of a commodity from the United States destined to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The commodity shall be deemed to have been exported on the date of the applicable export carrier onboard bill of lading or the date the commodity is received for shipment, as specified on the bill of lading, in the case of a commodity received for shipment in a lash barge or containerized van if a through on-board bill of lading is issued for shipment to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Export carrier.</E> The vessel on which a commodity is exported from the United States to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section, or if export is by railcar, truck, or airplane, “export carrier” means such railcar, truck, or airplane.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Exports for exporter's own account.</E> A transaction involving shipments made by the reporting exporter which are unsold at the time of export, shipments on consignment to selling agents of the reporting exporter for subsequent sale for the account of the reporting exporter, shipments by the reporting exporter that have not been allocated to any outstanding export sale, and shipments from the United States to any foreign country in bond for subsequent shipment to a third country.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Export sale.</E> A transaction entered into between a reporting exporter and a foreign buyer. The transaction must be represented by a written document evidencing that (1) the exporter agrees to export the commodity, (2) the foreign buyer agrees to receive the commodity, (3) a fixed price or an agreed upon mechanism by which such a price can be determined is established, and (4) payment will be made to or for the account of the reporting exporter by or on the behalf of the foreign buyer for delivery of the commodity. The quantity of “outstanding export sale” means the quantity not yet exported under an export sale. The terms of delivery specified in the written agreement, such as FAS vessel, FOB vessel, C&amp;F, CIF, etc., do not determine whether a transaction is an export sale which must be reported. A transaction which otherwise meets this definition and is subject to the posting of an exporter performance bond or letter of credit from the foreign buyer is included in this definition and such a transaction shall be reported under these regulations. However, a transaction which becomes operative only upon the imposition of export controls is excluded from this definition of “export sale” and such a transaction shall not be reported under these regulations.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Foreign buyer and foreign seller.</E> A person whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is outside the United States. Foreign buyer or foreign seller includes a person who maintains a place of doing business outside the United States even though the transaction is concluded in the United States by his agent who has a place of business in the United States or by his employee who does not maintain a place of doing business in the United States. (If such employee maintains a place of doing business in the United States with respect to the transaction, the resulting contract is construed to be a domestic sale.) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all foreign governments, agencies and instrumentalities are considered foreign buyers or foreign sellers even though transactions are concluded by their employees in the United States or they maintain a place of business with respect to the transaction in the United States.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Marketing year.</E> The reporting period specified for a commodity in appendix A to this part.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Optional origin contracts.</E> A transaction involving an export sale contract between a reporting exporter and a foreign buyer under which the reporting exporter has the option of exporting the commodity from the United States or from one or more other exporting countries or an export sale contract under which no origin is specified.</P>
          <P>(l) <E T="03">Person.</E> An individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity.</P>
          <P>(m) <E T="03">Purchases from foreign sellers.</E> A transaction involving the purchase of a commodity from a seller whose place of business with respect to the transaction is outside the United States.<PRTPAGE P="543"/>
          </P>
          <P>(n) <E T="03">Quantity.</E> The actual contract quantity (exclusive of any upward or downward tolerance) specified in the agreement between the reporting exporter and foreign buyer or seller.</P>
          <P>(o) <E T="03">Reporting exporter.</E> A person who enters into a transaction referred to in this section whose place of doing business with respect to such transaction is in the United States. A reporting exporter shall include any person who sells a commodity to a foreign buyer irrespective of whether or not such person may appear as the shipper on the export documentation or whether or not such person is required to file a Shipper's Export Declaration. A reporting exporter would not normally include agents of either the reporting exporter or foreign buyer, brokers, or freight forwarders unless such agents, brokers or freight forwarders are acting in the capacity of a principal. (See examples § 20.6(c).)</P>

Information for each applicable item on the respective form shall be reported. If the reporting exporter determines that the report forms cannot be received in the office specified in “20.10 by the time specified in paragraph (k) of this section, the exporter shall transmit the information contained in the report forms by the use of FAX, telephone, or electronic submission. The required form must be subsequently submitted in accordance with § 20.6(k)(2). Exporters have the option to submit the weekly reports using an electronic reporting system (forms 97e, 98e, and 100e) which may be accessed via a secured Internet website. Reporting exporters should contact the Export Sales Reporting staff to obtain passwords and access to the Internet reporting site. Exporters also have the option of satisfying the requirements of Forms FAS-97, FAS-98, and FAS-100 by submitting ASCII comma delimited files via e-mail to the ESR mailbox at <E T="03">esr@fas.usda.gov.</E>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Monthly reports.</E> The information described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be reported monthly when specified by an announcement issued pursuant to § 20.5. The forms specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be utilized to furnish the information required to be reported monthly and such information shall be filed in the manner and at the time required by § 20.6(k).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Exporters who are required to report.</E> The reporting exporter has the sole responsibility of reporting any and all information required by these regulations. The following are examples of who shall be considered the reporting exporter for the purpose of these regulations. (Firm A in each example is a firm whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, and the commodity to be delivered under the purchase contract is subject to these regulations. See § 20.4(i) for definition of a foreign buyer and foreign seller.)</P>
          <P>(1) Firm A makes an export sale to Firm B whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is also in the United States. Firm B has made or will make an export sale to a foreign buyer. In this case Firm A cannot report the sale to Firm B since Firm B's place of doing business with respect to the transaction is located in the United States. In this example, Firm B is required to report the sale to the foreign buyer.</P>
          <P>(2) Firm A makes an export sale to a foreign buyer through the foreign buyer's agent and the agent's place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States. In this example Firm A is required to report the export sale since the resulting contract is between Firm A and the foreign buyer.</P>

          <P>(3) Firm A consigns an export to his agent (other than an employee of Firm A). When the agent makes a sale to a foreign buyer, Firm A is required to report the sale. If the agent makes the sale to a firm whose place of doing <PRTPAGE P="545"/>business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, Firm A will not report the sale.</P>
          <P>(4) Firm A makes a purchase from a foreign seller. In this example, Firm A is required to report the purchase.</P>
          <P>(5) Firm A makes a purchase from an agent of a foreign seller and the agent's place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States. In this example, Firm A is required to report the purchase. The agent is not a principal party in interest in the contract and cannot report the sale to Firm A. The foreign seller is not a reporting exporter and is not required to make a report of the sale.</P>
          <P>(6) Firm A, the agent of the foreign buyer, whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, purchases commodities domestically at interior warehouses and arranges for exportation to its principal, the foreign buyer. In this example, Firm A is required to report the sale and export.</P>
          <P>(7) If a reporting exporter has a transaction not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this paragraph (c) and is in doubt whether a transaction should be reported, the exporter should request a decision from the office specified in § 20.10.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Contract terms.</E> Reports of contract terms shall be filed when requested in accordance with § 20.11. The report showing contract terms shall be filed on FAS-99, “Contract Terms Supporting Export Sales and Foreign Purchases,” and shall include the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Reporting exporter's contract number.</P>
          <P>(2) Date of export sale or purchase.</P>
          <P>(3) Name of foreign buyer or foreign seller.</P>
          <P>(4) Delivery period specified in the export sale or purchase.</P>
          <P>(5) Delivery terms specified in the export sale or purchase (F.O.B., C. &amp; F., etc.).</P>
          <P>(6) Actual quantity of the export sale or purchase.</P>
          <P>(7) Quantity not exported against the sale or foreign purchase (do not include any tolerance).</P>
          <P>(8) Country of destination.</P>
          <P>(9) On purchases from foreign sellers, show separately from export sales all items of this paragraph (d).</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting of destination.</E> The reporting exporters shall report the country of destination specified in the export sale contract or otherwise declared in writing by the foreign buyer. (Where a government, or agency of such government, is the sole importer of the commodity in a country, the exporter shall report that country as the country of destination only if the exporter or foreign buyer has made a direct sale to that foreign government or agency.) If the country of destination is not so specified or declared, the exporter shall report the destination as “unknown.” If by the time of exportation the exporter has not so ascertained the country of destination, the name of the country reported to the Bureau of Customs of the Shipper's Export Declaration for such export shipment should be reported, even though it may be an intermediate destination. The reporting exporter is not expected to report destination changes made after reporting the export on FAS-98, “Report of Export Sales and Exports.”</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Optional class or kind of commodity.</E> If the export sale provides for an option as to the class or kind of commodity to be delivered under the export sale, the reporting exporter should report the particular class or kind of commodity expected to be exported.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Range in contract quantity.</E> If the export sale provides for a range in quantity (e.g. 10,000 metric tons to 12,000 metric tons with or without a loading tolerance) with the reporting exporter or buyer having the option to declare a firm quantity at a later date, the reporting exporter shall report the maximum export sale quantity (exclusive of any loading tolerance). If an option is exercised for a lesser quantity at a later date, the reporting exporter shall report the reduction as an amendment to an export sale previously reported.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Transfer of unexported balances</E> from one marketing year to the next marketing year. If exports against an export sale are not complete by the end of the marketing year in which the <PRTPAGE P="546"/>commodity is being reported for export, the reporting exporter shall transfer the quantity not exported against the export sale to the next marketing year on the first report submitted after the beginning of the new marketing year.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Errors on previous reports.</E> Whenever an exporter discovers an error or is advised by the office specified in § 20.10 of an error on a prior report, the error shall be corrected in the current weekly report to reflect the proper outstanding export sales and exports. The exporter shall also furnish a complete written explanation of such reporting error.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">When reports are required.</E> (1) A reporting exporter shall submit reports for those commodities for which there are new export sales, outstanding export sales, exports for exporter's own account for which an offsetting export sale has not been made and reported, or purchases from foreign sellers.</P>
          <P>(2) A reporting exporter may discontinue reporting for a commodity only when actual exports and other required reporting of changes have reduced to zero all export sales, exports for exporter's own account and purchases from foreign sellers. The reporting exporter shall report a zero balance prior to discontinuing reporting for the commodity involved.</P>
          <P>(3) If a reporting exporter discontinues making reports because a zero balance has been reached for a particular commodity, the exporter shall be responsible to commence reporting again once a new export sale, a new export for exporter's own account, or a new purchase from a foreign seller for that commodity is made.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Manner and time of reporting</E>—(1) Manner. An original of all report forms, other than electronic forms and ASCII comma delimited files, must be filed with the office specified in § 20.10. Each report form shall contain the full business name, address and telephone number of the reporting exporter and the name and original signature of the person submitting the report form on behalf of the reporting exporter. Computer generated printouts may be used in lieu of standard reporting forms when approved by the office specified in § 20.10.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Time of filing reports.</E> Information required to be reported weekly (either via fax, telephone, or electronically) must be received in the office specified in § 20.10 no later than 11:59 p.m. eastern time, on each Monday or such other time as may be approved in advance by that office. Such weekly report must set forth the required information as to export sales transactions made during the seven day period ending the preceding Thursday, midnight. If Friday or Monday is a national holiday, the due date shall be Tuesday. If information is transmitted by other than use of forms specified in § 20.6(a) (such as by use of telephone or electronic transmission) the required forms containing such information shall be transmitted by first class mail the next business day. It is the responsibility of the reporting exporter to arrange the most efficient and expeditious manner for the office specified in § 20.10 to receive the reported information. Information required to be reported monthly must be received in the office specified in § 20.10 no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, the fourth business day following the end of the reporting month, or such other time as may be approved in advance by that office, setting forth the required information as to export sales transactions made during the reporting month ending midnight the last day of such month.</P>

            <P>The Rural Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419), herein called the Act consists of six titles designed to facilitate the development of rural communities through a series of authorizations including grants, loans, and administrative provisions. This Act adds new statutory rural development coordination responsibilities to certain Federal departments and agencies to be carried out under the leadership of the Secretary of Agriculture.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Summary of authorities.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The purpose of this section is to give notice that certain authorities have been delegated by the Secretary of USDA agencies for implementation. New Secretarial delegations covering the Rural Development Act were effective May 31, 1973, and were published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> June 7, 1973 (38 FR 14944-14953). These are as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) Title I (38 FR 14948). Responsibility delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Rural Development. The responsibility for administering loan and grant authorities is redelegated to the Farmers Home Administration, except the responsibility for administering loan authorities with respect to rural electrification and telephone facilities and service which has been redelegated to the Rural Electrification Administration.</P>

            <P>(b) Titles II (38 FR 14945-14948), III (38 FR 14945-14948), and V (38 FR 14945-14948. Responsibility delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and Education and redelegated as follows:<PRTPAGE P="550"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Titles II (38 FR 14951-14952) and III (38 FR 14951-14952) to the Administrator, Soil Conservation Service.</P>
            <P>(2) Title V (38 FR 14949-14950) to the Administrators, Cooperative State Research Service and the Extension Service respectively.</P>
            <P>(c) Title IV (38 FR 14945-14948). Responsibility delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and Education and redelegated (38 FR 14950-14951) to the Chief of the Forest Service.</P>
            <P>(d) Title VI, section 603 (38 FR 14948). Responsibility delegated to Assistant Secretary for Rural Development and redelegated (38 FR 14953) to the Administrator, Rural Development Service.</P>
            <FP>The Rural Development Act recognizes that many Federal departments and agencies of the executive branch of government administer programs and provide services which are applicable to the needs of rural communities. Section 603 of the Rural Development Act charges the Secretary of Agriculture with providing governmentwide leadership for, and with coordinating a nationwide rural development program. In such coordination, the Secretary shall seek measures that will achieve effective integration of relevant Federal services in rural areas as provided by Agriculture agencies and other Departments and agencies. This section also requires that the Secretary shall establish goals and report to the Congress on progress in complying with specified purposes of the Act. The Federal Regional Council will play a major role in coordination at the field level. An organic Act of the Department (7 U.S.C. 2201) has been amended to require the Secretary to add Rural Development to those purposes for which he is authorized to acquire and diffuse useful information.</FP>

            <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Federal implementation of the Act will be consistent with the President's policy of decentralized decisionmaking and administrative responsibility which gives fullest possible consideration to State and local rural development goals and priorities. As a result of section 817(4) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-86) which prohibits prior approval by any State officials of any loan or grant under any program authorized by title I of the Rural Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419), it has been necessary to substantially modify the planned administration of programs under section 603 of the Rural Development Act.</P>

            <P>(a) Title I grant funds and approved loan funding levels will be allocated <PRTPAGE P="553"/>among States by a formula designed to ensure equitable treatment. This applies to amounts made available for business and industrial loans, water, sewer and other community facilities except electrical and telephone facilities provided by or through the Rural Electrification Administration.</P>
            <P>(b) During the second half of the fiscal year, the Secretary of Agriculture shall review State and multicounty jurisdictional rural development programs and projects so that unused allocations may be shifted from one State to another so as to enable the obligation of all available funds prior to the end of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(c) The formula used for fund allocation will ensure that a minimum loan and grant level is established so that no State receives an amount too small to serve the purposes of the Act. A percentage of total loan and grant authority will be withheld from initial allocation to allow subsequent appropriate technical adjustments in amounts allocated to individual States.</P>
            <P>(d) Title V funds shall be distributed by the Secretary under the formula specified in the Act. Title V activities will be consistent with the principle that States and multicounty jurisdictions have responsibility for the rural development planning and priority setting functions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Strategic plan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Principles of strategic plan.</E> The strategic plan included in the application must be developed in accordance with the following four key principles:</P>

            <P>(1) Strategic vision for change, which identifies what the community will become and a strategic map for revitalization. The vision should build on assets and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for <PRTPAGE P="567"/>evaluating and adjusting the revitalization plan.</P>
            <P>(2) Community-based partnerships, involving the participation of all segments of the community, including the political and governmental leadership, community groups, local public health and social service departments and nonprofit groups providing similar services, environmental groups, local transportation planning entities, public and private schools, religious organizations, the private and nonprofit sectors, centers of learning, and other community institutions and individual citizens.</P>
            <P>(3) Economic opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, entrepreneurial initiatives, small business expansion, job training and other important services such as affordable childcare and transportation services that may enable residents to be employed in jobs that offer upward mobility.</P>
            <P>(4) Sustainable community development, to advance the creation of livable and vibrant communities through comprehensive approaches that coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community, and human development. These approaches should preserve the environment and historic landmarks—they may include “brownfields” clean-up and redevelopment, and promote transportation, education, and public safety.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimum requirements.</E> The strategic plan must:</P>
            <P>(1) Describe the coordinated economic, human, community, and physical development plan and related activities proposed for the nominated area;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe the process by which the affected community is a full partner in the process of developing and implementing the plan and the extent to which local institutions and organizations have contributed to the planning process;</P>
            <P>(3) Identify the amount of State, local, and private resources that will be available in the nominated area and the private and public partnerships to be used, which may include participation by, and cooperation with, universities, medical centers, and other private and public entities;</P>
            <P>(4) Identify the funding requested under any Federal program in support of the proposed economic, human, community, and physical development and related activities, including details about proposed uses of EZ/EC SSBG funds that may be available from HHS;</P>
            <P>(5) Identify the baselines, methods, and benchmarks for measuring the success of carrying out the strategic plan, including the extent to which poor persons and families will be empowered to become economically self-sufficient;</P>
            <P>(6) Must not include any action to assist any establishment in relocating from one area outside the nominated area to the nominated area, except that assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is permitted if:</P>
            <P>(i) The establishment of the new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in a decrease in employment in the area of original location or in any other area where the existing business entity conducts business operations; and</P>
            <P>(ii) There is no reason to believe that the new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its original location or in any other area where the existing business entity conducts business operation; and</P>
            <P>(7) Include such other information as required by USDA in the notice inviting applications or other applicable notice.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Implementation of strategic plan.</E> The strategic plan may be implemented by State governments, tribal governments, local governments, regional planning agencies, non-profit organizations, community-based organizations, or other nongovernmental entities. Activities included in the strategic plan may be funded from any source, Federal, State, local, or private, which agrees to provide assistance to the nominated area.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Public access to materials and proceedings.</E> The applicant or the lead managing entity, as applicable, must make available to the public copies of <PRTPAGE P="568"/>the strategic plan and supporting documentation and must conduct its meetings in accordance with the applicable open meetings acts.</P>

            <P>The strategic plan will be evaluated for effectiveness as part of the designation process for nominated rural areas described in subpart D of this part. On the basis of this evaluation, USDA may request additional information pertaining to the plan and the proposed area and may, as part of that request, suggest modifications to the plan, proposed area, or term that would enhance its effectiveness. The effectiveness of the strategic plan will be determined in accordance with the four key principles contained in § 25.202(a). USDA will review each plan submitted in terms of the four equally weighted principal objectives, and of such other elements of these principal objectives as are appropriate to address the opportunities and problems of each nominated area, which may include:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Strategic vision for change</E>—(1) <E T="03">Goals and coordinated strategy.</E> The extent to which the strategic plan reflects a projection for the community's revitalization which links economic, human, physical, community development and other activities in a mutually reinforcing, synergistic way to achieve ultimate goals;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Creativity and innovation.</E> The extent to which the activities proposed in the plan are creative, innovative and promising and will promote the civic spirit necessary to revitalize the nominated area;</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Benchmarks and learning.</E> The extent to which the plan includes performance benchmarks for measuring progress in its implementation, including an on-going process for adjustments, corrections and building on what works.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Community-based partnerships</E>—(1) <E T="03">Community partners.</E> The extent to which residents of the community participated in developing the strategic plan and their commitment to implementing it, the extent to which community-based organizations in the nominated area have participated in the development of the nominated area, and their record of success measured by their achievements and support for undertakings within the nominated area;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Private and nonprofit organizations as partners.</E> The extent to which partnership arrangements include commitments from private and nonprofit organizations, including corporations, utilities, banks and other financial institutions, human services organizations, health care providers, and educational institutions supporting implementation of the strategic plan;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">State and local government partners.</E> The extent to which States and local governments are committed to providing support to the strategic plan, including their commitment to “reinventing” their roles and coordinating programs to implement the strategic plan; and</P>
