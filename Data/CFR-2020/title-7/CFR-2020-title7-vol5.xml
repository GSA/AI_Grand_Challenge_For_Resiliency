      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a State or political subdivision of a State may not impose prohibitions or restrictions upon the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a regulation or order to prevent the dissemination of the biological control organism, plant pest, or noxious weed within the United States. The only exceptions to this are:</P>
              <P>(1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or political subdivision of a State are consistent with and do not exceed the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, or</P>
              <P>(2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data or a thorough risk assessment.</P>
              <P>(b) The regulations in this subpart provide for the submission and consideration of special need requests when a State or a political subdivision of a State seeks to impose prohibitions or restrictions on the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or noxious weeds that are in addition to the prohibitions or restrictions imposed by this part or by a Federal Order.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for special need requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A special need request, as described in § 301.1, may be generated by a State or a political subdivision of a State. If the request is generated by a political subdivision of a State, the request must be submitted to APHIS through the State. States may also collaborate with other States to submit multi-State special need requests. However, if submitted, the multi-State special need request must include information in sufficient detail to allow APHIS to analyze the impacts on each State on an individual basis. All special need requests must be signed by the executive official or officials or by a plant protection official or officials of the State(s) making the request and must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Data drawn from a scientifically sound detection survey, showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern does not exist in the State or political subdivision or, if already present in the State or political subdivision, the distribution of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern;</P>
              <P>(2) If the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest is not present in the State or political subdivision, a risk analysis or other scientific data showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest could enter the State or political subdivision and become established;</P>
              <P>(3) Specific information showing that, if introduced into or allowed to spread within the State or political subdivision, the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest would harm or injure the environment or agricultural resources in the State or political subdivision. The request should contain detailed information, including quantitative estimates, if available, about what harm or injury would result from the introduction or dissemination of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision;</P>
              <P>(4) Specific information showing that the State or political subdivision has characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest, such as unique plants, diversity of flora, historical concerns, or any other special basis for the request for additional restrictions or prohibitions; and</P>
              <P>(5) Information detailing the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions and scientific data demonstrating that the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions are necessary and adequate, and that there is no less drastic action that is feasible and that would be adequate, to prevent the introduction or spread of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision.</P>
              <P>(b) All special need requests must be submitted to the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, Jamie L. Whitten Federal Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Room 301-E, Washington, DC 20250.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 301.1-3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Action on special need requests.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Upon receipt of a complete special need request submitted in accordance with § 301.1-2, APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to inform the public of the special need request and to make the request and its supporting information available for review and comment for at least 60 days.</P>

              <P>(b) Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either grant or deny the special need request. The Administrator's determination will be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted by the State or political subdivision of a State in support of its request and would take into account any comments received.<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator grants the special need request, the State or political subdivision of a State will be authorized to impose only the specific prohibitions or restrictions identified in the request and approved by APHIS. APHIS will coordinate with the State, or with the State on behalf of the political subdivision of the State, to ensure that the additional prohibitions or restrictions are in accord with the special need exception granted by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator denies the special need request, the State or political subdivision of a State will be notified in writing of the reason for the denial and may submit any additional information the State or political subdivision of a State may have in order to request a reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(c) If granted, a special need exception will be applicable for 2 years, at the end of which the State or political subdivision of a State must submit a request for renewal of the exception. A special need renewal request must address the same criteria as the initial request submitted under § 301.1-2 and must show that a special need still exists that warrants the continuation of the special need exception. The renewal must be submitted no sooner than 6 months and no later than 3 months prior to the end of the 2-year applicability period for the initial exception. Once a special need renewal request has been received, APHIS will follow the same notice and comment process outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If, by the end of the 2-year applicability period, the State or political subdivision of a State does not submit a special need renewal request, the State's or political subdivision's special need exception will lapse and the State or political subdivision of a State will have to reapply for the special need exception.</P>

              <P>(d) If the Administrator determines that there is a need for the withdrawal of a special need exception before the renewal date of the special need exception, the reasons for the withdrawal would be communicated to the State or to the political subdivision of the State and APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to inform the public of the withdrawal of the special need exception and to make the information supporting the withdrawal available for review and comment for at least 60 days. Reasons for withdrawal of approval of a special need exception may include, but are not limited to, the availability of new scientific data or changes in APHIS regulations. Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either withdraw or uphold the special need exception. The Administrator's determination will be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted in support of the withdrawal and would take into account any comments received.</P>

These treatments must take place at 6- to 10-day intervals, starting a sufficient time before harvest (but not less than 30 days before harvest) to allow for development of fruit fly egg and larvae. Determination of the time period must be based on the day degrees model for the specific fruit fly. Once treatment has begun, it must continue through the harvest period. The malathion bait spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 2.4 oz of technical grade malathion and 9.6 oz of protein hydrolysate per acre. The spinosad bait spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 0.01 oz of a USDA-approved spinosad formulation and 48 oz of protein hydrolysate per acre.

If in all 12 tests, the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of infection after 7 days and the test plants do not, USDA will declare the test plant variety rust-resistant. The tests must be performed on new growth, just as the leaves are unfolding.</P>

In addition, the State must employ personnel with responsibility for the issuance and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with § 301.38-5, and maintain and enforce an inspection program under which every plant nursery within the State is inspected at least once each year to ensure that they are free of rust-susceptible plants. During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera <E T="03">Berberis, Mahoberberis,</E> and <E T="03">Mahonia,</E> and that the plants are true to type.

The distance between the inspectors may vary within this range, depending upon the visibility of the plant growth. In areas with low brush and flat terrain, the inspectors may be the maximum distance of 20 feet apart if they can observe all plants growing within 10 feet of them. In areas of high plant growth or hilly terrain, the inspectors must be closer together due to limited or obstructed visibility. Inspectors must observe all plants growing between themselves and the mid-point of the distance between themselves and the next inspector. This process must be repeated so that the entire band, measured from the border of the property to the circumference of an imaginary circle having the property as its mid-point, is visually inspected in this manner.</P>

              <P>(a) Generally infested areas. The Administrator shall list as generally infested areas in § 301.45-3 each State or each portion thereof in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an inspector, or each portion of a State which the Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities; Except that, an area shall not be listed as a generally infested area if the Administrator has determined that:</P>
              <P>(1) The area is subject to a gypsy moth eradication program conducted by the Federal government or a State government in accordance with the Eradication, Suppression, and Slow the Spread alternative of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Gypsy Moth Suppression and Eradication Projects that was filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency on January 16, 1996; and,</P>
              <P>(2) State or Federal delimiting trapping surveys conducted in accordance with Section II, “Survey Procedures—Gypsy Moth” of the Gypsy Moth Treatment Manual show that the average number of gypsy moths caught per trap is less than 10 and that the trapping surveys show that the eradication program is effectively diminishing the gypsy moth population of the area.</P>
              <P>(b) Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally infested area only if the Administrator has determined that:</P>
              <P>(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and,</P>
              <P>(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a generally infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of infestations of the gypsy moth.</P>
              <P>(c) Temporary designation of areas as generally infested areas. The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any area in any State as a generally infested area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. An inspector will give written notice of the designation to the owner or person in possession of the area and thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from such areas is subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, each generally infested area will be added to the list in § 301.45-3 or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an authorized inspector, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the areas.</P>
              <P>(d) Termination of designation as a generally infested area. The Administrator shall terminate the designation of any area as a generally infested area whenever the Administrator determines that the area no longer requires designation under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) Regulated articles and outdoor household articles from generally infested areas. (1) A regulated article, except for an article moved in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, shall not be moved interstate from any generally infested area into or through any area that is not generally infested unless a certificate or permit has been issued and attached to such regulated article in accordance with §§ 301.45-5 and 301.45-8. <SU>3</SU>

              <P>(2) An outdoor household article shall not be moved interstate from any generally infested area into or through any area that is not generally infested unless a certificate or OHA document has been issued and attached to such outdoor household article in accordance with §§ 301.45-5 and 301.45-8.</P>
              <P>(b) A regulated article originating outside of any generally infested area may be moved interstate directly through any generally infested area without a certificate or permit if the point of origin of the article is clearly indicated by shipping documents, its identity has been maintained, and it has been safeguarded against infestation while in any generally infested area during the months of April through August.</P>
              <P>(c) A regulated article originating in a generally infested area may be moved interstate from a generally infested area without a certificate if it complies with (1) or (2) of this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) The article is moved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes, and:</P>
              <P>(i) Is moved pursuant to a permit issued for each article by the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is moved in accordance with conditions specified on the permit and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the dissemination of the gypsy moth, i.e., conditions of treatment, processing, shipment, and disposal; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Is moved with a tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the article or securely attached to the article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a permit number corresponding to the number of the permit issued for such article.</P>
              <P>(2) The article is logs, pulpwood, or bark and bark products, and the person moving the article has attached a signed accurate statement to the waybill or other shipping documents accompanying the article stating that he or she has inspected the article in accordance with the Gypsy Moth Program Manual no more than 5 days prior to the date of movement and has found no life stages of gypsy moth on the article.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Issuance and cancellation of certificates, limited permits, and outdoor household article documents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A certificate may be issued by an inspector for the movement of a regulated article or an outdoor household article (OHA) if the inspector determines that it is eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such article and:</P>
              <P>(1) It has originated in noninfested premises in a generally infested area and has not been exposed to the gypsy moth while within the generally infested area; or</P>

              <P>(2) The inspector inspects the article no more than 5 days prior to the date of movement during the months of April through August (14 days prior to the date of movement from September <PRTPAGE P="40"/>through March) and finds it to be free of the gypsy moth; or</P>
              <P>(3) It has been treated under the direction of an inspector to destroy the gypsy moth in accordance with the treatment manual and part 305 of this chapter; or</P>
              <P>(4) It has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby as determined by an inspector.</P>
              <P>(b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of any regulated article under this subpart to specified destinations for specified handling, utilization, processing, or treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when, upon evaluation of all of the circumstances involved in each case, the Administrator determines that such movement will not result in the spread of the gypsy moth because life stages of the moths will be destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, processing or treatment, or the pest will not survive in areas to which shipped, and the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.</P>
              <P>(c) Certificate and limited permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use for subsequent shipments of regulated articles provided the person is operating under a compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may reproduce the forms as needed to attach them to regulated articles moved under a compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may execute and issue the certificate forms or reproduction of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement, if the person has treated such regulated articles as specified in the compliance agreement, and if the regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when an inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) A certificate may be issued by a qualified certified applicator for the interstate movement of any outdoor household article or mobile home if such qualified certified applicator determines the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That the article has been inspected by the qualified certified applicator and found to be free of any life stage of the gypsy moth; or</P>
              <P>(2) That the article has been treated by, or treated under the direct supervision of, the qualified certified applicator to destroy any life stage of the gypsy moth in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed in section III of the Gypsy Moth Program Manual.</P>
              <P>(e) An OHA document may be issued by the owner of an outdoor household article for the interstate movement of the article if such person has inspected the outdoor household article and has found it to be free of any life stage of gypsy moth.</P>
              <P>(f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector if he determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document. The reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for his decision as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.</P>

Qualified certified applicators must enter into compliance agreements, in accordance with the definition of qualified certified applicator in § 301.45-1. A compliance agreement shall specify safeguards necessary to prevent spread of the gypsy moth, such as disinfestation practices or application of chemical materials in accordance with the treatment manual and part 305 of this chapter. Compliance agreement forms may be obtained from the Administrator or an inspector.</P>
              <P>(b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the inspector finds that such person has failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons therefore shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation.

                <P>(a) An inspector, upon visual inspection of the airport and/or the aircraft, determines that the regulated article does not present a threat to spread the Japanese beetle because adult beetle populations are not present; or</P>
                <P>(b) The aircraft is opened and loaded only while it is enclosed inside a hangar that an inspector has determined to be free of and safeguarded against Japanese beetle; or</P>
                <P>(c) The aircraft is loaded during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. only or lands and departs during those hours and, in either situation, is kept completely closed while on the ground during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.; or</P>
                <P>(d) If opened and loaded between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., the aircraft is inspected, treated, and safeguarded. Inspection, treatment, and safeguarding must be done either under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.48-8 or under the direct supervision of an inspector. On a case-by-case basis, inspectors will determine which of the following conditions, and any supplemental conditions deemed necessary by the Administrator to prevent the spread of Japanese beetle, are required:</P>
                <P>(1) All openings of the aircraft must be closed or safeguarded during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. by exclusionary devices or by other means approved by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(2) All cargo containers that have not been safeguarded in a protected area must be inspected immediately prior to and during the loading process. All personnel must check their clothing immediately prior to entering the aircraft. All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed.</P>
                <P>(3) All areas around doors and hatches or other openings in the aircraft must be inspected prior to removing the exclusionary devices. All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed. All doors and hatches must be closed immediately after the exclusionary devices are moved away from the aircraft.</P>
                <P>(4) Aircraft must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter no more than 1 hour before loading. Particular attention should be paid to the ball mat area and the holes around the main entrance. The aircraft must then be aerated under safeguard conditions as required by part 305 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(5) Aircraft treatment records must be maintained by the applicator completing or supervising the treatment for a period of 2 years. These records must be provided upon request for review by an inspector. Treatment records shall include the pesticide used, the date of application, the location where the pesticide was applied (airport and aircraft), the amount of pesticide applied, and the name of the applicator.</P>

                <P>(6) When a designated aircraft is replaced with an alternate one just prior to departure (the procedure known as “tail swapping”), the alternate aircraft must be inspected and all Japanese beetles must be removed. The aircraft must be safeguarded by closing all openings and hatches or by equipping the aircraft with exclusionary devices <PRTPAGE P="45"/>until the aircraft is ready for use. During loading, all treatment and safeguard requirements applicable to regularly scheduled aircraft must be implemented.</P>
                <P>(7) Aircraft may be retreated in the noninfested State if live Japanese beetles are found.</P>
                <P>(8) Notification of unscheduled commercial flights and of all military flights must be given at least 1 hour before departure to the appropriate person in the destination airport of any of the States listed in § 301.48(b). Notification of arriving military flights should also be given to base commanders to facilitate the entrance of Federal and/or State inspectors onto the base if necessary.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area, in paragraph (c) of this section, each State, or each portion of a State, in which the pine shoot beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the pine shoot beetle is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the pine shoot beetle has been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine and regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of these articles; and</P>
              <P>(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the pine shoot beetle.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written notice of this temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section, or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(c) The areas described below are designated as quarantined areas:</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of this section, each State or each portion of a State in which the Asian longhorned beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the Asian longhorned beetle is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities where Asian longhorned beetle has been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and</P>
              <P>(2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the Asian longhorned beetle.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.</P>

              <P>(B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping, or has been stored, packed, or handled at locations approved by an inspector as not posing a risk of infestation by Asian longhorned beetle; and</P>
              <P>(C) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity.</P>
              <P>(b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the regulated article. Articles found to be infected by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.</P>

Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been cancelled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Quarantined areas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of this section each State or each portion of a State in which the emerald ash borer has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the emerald ash borer is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities where emerald ash borer has been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and</P>
              <P>(2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the emerald ash borer.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(c) The following areas are designated as quarantined areas:</P>

              <P>(ii) The regulated article, if moved through the quarantined area during the period of May 1 through August 31 or when the ambient air temperature is 40 °F or higher, is moved in an enclosed vehicle or is completely covered to prevent access by the EAB; and</P>

              <P>(iii) The regulated article is moved directly through the quarantined area without stopping (except for refueling or for traffic conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs), or has been stored, packed, or handled at locations approved by an inspector as not posing a risk of infestation by emerald ash borer; and<PRTPAGE P="67"/>

                <FTREF/> or person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article:</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are listed in the local telephone directories. Information concerning such local offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(1)(i) Is apparently free of EAB, based on inspection; or the article or</P>
              <P>(ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in a manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, prevents the regulated article from presenting a risk of spreading EAB; and</P>
              <P>(2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) <SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> in order to prevent the artificial spread of emerald ash borer; and</P>

                  <SU>2</SU> An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 423 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated articles.</P>
              <P>(b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the regulated article:</P>
              <P>(1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of emerald ash borer because emerald ash borer will be destroyed by the specific processing, handling, or utilization; and</P>
              <P>(2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of emerald ash borer; and</P>
              <P>(3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.</P>
              <P>(c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.53-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in <PRTPAGE P="68"/>writing, stating the reasons for the decision.</P>

The Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with written notice of the temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area will be subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, the area will be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.</P>

If the trees were not destroyed by the date specified on the emergency action notification, the compensation payment will be reduced by 10 percent and by any tree removal costs incurred by the State or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The maximum USDA compensation rate is 85 percent of the loss in value, adjusted for any State-provided compensation to ensure total compensation from all sources does not exceed 100 percent of the loss in value.</P>

                <P>(2) The plants are started, are grown, and have been maintained solely at the nursery from which they will be moved interstate.</P>
                <P>(3) If the plants are not grown from seed, then the cuttings used for propagation of the plants are taken from plants located on the same nursery premises or from another nursery that is eligible to produce kumquat plants for interstate movement under the requirements of this paragraph (b). Cuttings may not be obtained from properties where citrus canker is present.</P>
                <P>(4) All citrus plants at the nursery premises have undergone State inspection and have been found to be free of citrus canker no less than three times. The inspections must be at intervals of 30 to 45 days, with the most recent inspection being within 30 days of the date on which the plants are removed and packed for shipment.</P>

                <P>(5) All vehicles, equipment, and other articles used in providing inspection, maintenance, or related services in the nursery must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter before entering the nursery to prevent the introduction of citrus canker.

The Administrator will publish a description of all areas quarantined for citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid on the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Web site: (<E T="03">http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/citrus_greening/index.shtml</E>). The description of each quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of any changes that have been made to the quarantined area. Lists of all quarantined areas may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the Internet at (<E T="03">http://www.aphis.usda.gov/services/report_pest_disease/report_pest_disease.shtml</E>). After a change is made to the description of quarantined areas, we will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined areas.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area.</E> Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area for citrus greening or the Asian citrus psyllid only if the Administrator determines that:</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.</E> The Deputy Administrator shall designate as regulated areas, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.80-2a, each quarantined State, or each portion thereof in which witchweed has been found or in which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may designate any regulated area or portion thereof, as a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in § 301.80-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:</P>
                <P>(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of witchweed.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.</E> The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof <PRTPAGE P="100"/>on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list in § 301.80-2a if a basis then exists for their designation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area.</E> The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.</E> The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.80-2b, list regulated articles or movements of regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve such requirements.</P>

                <P>This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is designed to keep nurseries free of the imported fire ant and provides a basis to certify containerized nursery stock for interstate movement. Participating regulated establishments must be operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.81-6. Such compliance agreements shall state the specific requirements that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in accordance with the requirements of the program. Certificates and a nursery identification number may be issued to the nursery for use on shipments of regulated articles.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Detection.</E> (1) Nursery owners are required to visually survey their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.</P>
                <P>(2) Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to eliminate the colonies.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Control.</E> Nursery plants that are shipped under this program must originate in a nursery that meets the requirements of this section. Nursery owners must implement a treatment program with registered bait and contact insecticides. The premises, including growing and holding areas, must be maintained free of the imported fire ant. As part of this treatment program, all exposed soil surfaces (including sod and mulched areas) on property where plants are grown, potted, stored, handled, loaded, unloaded, or sold must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at least once every 6 months. The first application must be performed early in the spring. Followup treatments with a contact insecticide in accordance with part 305 of this chapter must be applied to eliminate all remaining colonies.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusion.</E> (1) For plants grown on the premises, treatment of soil or potting media in accordance with part 305 of this chapter prior to planting is required.</P>
                <P>(2) For plants received from outside sources, to prevent the spread into a nursery free of the imported fire ant by newly introduced, infested nursery plants, all plants must be:</P>
                <P>(i) Obtained from nurseries that comply with the requirements of this section and that operate under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.81-6; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Treated upon delivery in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, and within the specified number of days be either:</P>
                <P>(A) Repotted in treated potting soil media;</P>
                <P>(B) Retreated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at the specified interval; or</P>
                <P>(C) Shipped.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> (1) The nursery owner must maintain records of the nursery's surveys and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records <PRTPAGE P="117"/>must be made available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.</P>
                <P>(2) If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an inspection by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates for movement will be suspended until necessary treatments are applied and the plants and nursery premises are determined to be free of the imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may declare a nursery to be free of the imported fire ant upon reinspection of the premises. This inspection must be conducted no sooner than 30 days after treatment. During this period, certification may be based upon treatments for plants in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was found on a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire ant, the department of agriculture in the State of origin must cease its certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation by Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to determine the probable source of the problem and to ensure that the problem is resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of certification for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free premises will be suspended until treatment and elimination of the infestation is completed. Reinstatement into the program will be granted upon determination that the nursery premises are free of the imported fire ant, and that all other provisions of this subpart are being followed.</P>
                <P>(4) In cases where the issuance of certificates is suspended through oral notification, the suspension and the reasons for the suspension will be confirmed in writing within 20 days of the oral notification of the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has been suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving the written suspension notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.</P>

The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in § 301.85-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:</P>

As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list in § 301.85-2a if a basis then exists for their designation; otherwise the designation shall be terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area.</E> The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area listed as a regulated area and suppressive or generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compensation for growers, handlers, and seed companies in the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first regulated crop season.</E> Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued after the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in Oklahoma during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive compensation if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that meets the above requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under the first regulated crop season are eligible for compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop season wheat and for wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold at the time the area became regulated. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, wheat held back from harvest by a grower in the 2000-2001 growing season for use as seed in the next growing season, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Growers.</E> Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for <PRTPAGE P="148"/>Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.</P>
              <P>(i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual price received by the grower.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was determined in the contract after the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Handlers and seed companies.</E> Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas.</E> For the 1999-2000 crop season and the 2000-2001 crop season only, growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt before the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued before the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas will not be eligible for compensation for wheat from the 2001-2002 and subsequent crop seasons; except that, for growers or handlers of wheat harvested in any field in the Texas counties of Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young during the 2000-2001 crop season that has not been found to contain a bunted wheat kernel, this requirement applies to compensation for wheat from the 2002-2003 and subsequent crop seasons. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Growers.</E> Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.<PRTPAGE P="149"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Handlers and seed companies.</E> Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">To claim compensation.</E> Compensation payments to growers, handlers, and seed companies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by FSA on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for subsequent crop seasons must be received by FSA on or before March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend the deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates. To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed company must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the following documents:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Growers, handlers, and seed companies.</E> A grower, handler, or seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) (EAN) has been issued, the grower, handler, or seed company must submit a copy of the EAN. Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For compensation claims for wheat seed, a grower or seed company must submit documentation showing that the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more of the following types of documents: an application to the State seed certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency verifying that the wheat is certified seed);</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Growers.</E> In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, growers must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the grower. Growers compensated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (previously regulated areas) whose wheat was not tested prior to sale must submit documentation showing that the price paid to the grower was contingent on test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat or a copy of the contract the grower has for the wheat, if this information appears on those documents).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Handlers and seed companies.</E> In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, handlers and seed companies must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the handler or seed company. The handler or seed company must also submit documentation showing that the price paid or to be paid to the grower is not contingent on the test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the purchase of the wheat or a copy of the contract the handler or seed company has with the grower, if this information appears on those documents).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Special allowance for negative wheat grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, wheat that was harvested from fields in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season, and that tested negative for Karnal bunt after harvest, is eligible for compensation in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Special allowance for disposal costs for treated uncertified wheat seed in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, growers in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, who own treated uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for Karnal bunt spores during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible for compensation in accordance with this paragraph. The grower is eligible for compensation for the costs of disposing of such wheat seed, by burial on the grower's premises, by burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial on the grower's premises is $1.00 per bushel. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS, is the actual cost of disposal, up to $1.20 per bushel, as verified by receipts for disposal costs. To apply for this compensation, the grower must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA, and must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for spores (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For seed disposed of by burial at a landfill the grower must also submit one or more receipts for the disposal costs of the uncertified wheat seed, showing the total bushels destroyed and the total disposal costs (landfill fees, transportation costs, etc.).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compensation for grain storage facilities, flour millers, National Survey participants, and certain custom harvesters and equipment owners or lessees for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Owners of grain storage facilities, flour millers, and participants in the National Karnal Bunt Survey are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Decontamination of grain storage facilities.</E> Owners of grain storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain storage facilities pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the facilities, are eligible to be compensated, on a one time only basis for each facility for each covered crop year wheat, for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of decontamination. However, compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility (as defined in § 301.89-1). General clean-up, repair, and refurbishment costs are excluded from compensation. Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the owner of the grain storage facility must submit to an inspector records demonstrating that decontamination was performed on all structures, conveyances, or materials ordered by APHIS to be decontaminated. The records must include a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or the letter from an inspector ordering decontamination, contracts with individuals or companies hired to perform the decontamination, receipts for equipment and materials purchased to perform the decontamination, time sheets for employees of the grain storage facility who performed activities connected to the decontamination, and any other documentation that helps show the cost to the owner and that decontamination has been completed. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.<PRTPAGE P="151"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Flour millers.</E> Flour millers who, in accordance with a compliance agreement with APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by APHIS to be heat treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of $35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated will be calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must submit to an inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy of PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by the inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">National Karnal Bunt Survey participants.</E> If a grain storage facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive for Karnal bunt, the facility will be regulated, and may be ordered decontaminated, pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the facility. If the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency in the State in which the grain storage facility is located, the owner will be eligible for compensation as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Loss in value of positive wheat.</E> The owner of the grain storage facility will be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat minus the actual price received for the wheat. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the relevant time period for that facility, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances. Compensation payments for loss in value of wheat will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to the local FSA office a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. The owner of the facility must also submit to FSA a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or letter from an inspector under which the facility is or was quarantined; verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification); and a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the owner of the grain storage facility. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Decontamination of grain storage facilities.</E> The owner of the facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain storage facility for each covered crop year wheat for the direct costs of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described under <PRTPAGE P="152"/>paragraph (a) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct costs of decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility). Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage facilities will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be submitted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.</P>

The Administrator may extend this deadline upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before this date. All compensation payments made under this paragraph § 301.89-16(d) will be issued by APHIS. Claims for compensation should be sent to Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, 304 West Main Street, Olney, TX 76374.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Custom harvesters.</E> (i) <E T="03">Cleaning and disinfection of mechanized harvesting equipment.</E> Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season are eligible to receive compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfecting their mechanized harvesting equipment as required by § 301.89-12(a). Compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfection mechanized harvesting equipment used to harvest Karnal bunt-infected host crops will be either the actual cost or $750 per cleaned machine, whichever is less. To claim compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the custom harvester entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting equipment from a regulated area after it had been used to harvest host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected; and a receipt showing the cost of the cleaning and disinfection.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Contracts lost due to cleaning and disinfection.</E> Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season are also eligible to be compensated for the revenue lost if they lost one contract due to downtime necessitated by cleaning and disinfection, if the contract to harvest Karnal bunt-infected host crops in a previously nonregulated area was signed before the area was declared a regulated area for Karnal bunt. Compensation will only be provided for one contract lost due to cleaning and disinfection.

Less than an entire area will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:</P>
              <P>(i) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of <E T="03">Phytophthora ramorum.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written notice for the temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated, restricted, or associated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area will be subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be <PRTPAGE P="162"/>added to the list in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Cold treatment requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Certification of treatment facilities.</E> All facilities or locations used for refrigerating fruits or vegetables in accordance with the cold treatment schedules in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another treatment schedule approved in accordance with § 305.2 must be certified by APHIS. Recertification of the facility or carrier is required every 3 years, or as often as APHIS directs, depending on treatments performed, commodities handled, and operations conducted at the facility. A facility will only be certified or recertified if the Administrator determines that the location of the facility is such that those Federal agencies involved in its operation and oversight have adequate resources to conduct the necessary operations at the facility, that the pest risks can be managed at that location, and that the facility meets all criteria for approval. Other agencies that have regulatory oversight and requirements must concur in writing with the establishment of the facility prior to APHIS approval. In order to be certified, facilities and carriers must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be capable of keeping treated and untreated fruits, vegetables, or other articles separate so as to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of pests;</P>
            <P>(2) Be capable of preventing the escape and spread of pests while regulated articles are at the facility; and</P>
            <P>(3) Have equipment that is adequate to effectively perform cold treatment.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Location of facilities.</E> Where certified cold treatment facilities are available, an approved cold treatment may be conducted for any imported regulated article either prior to shipment to the United States or in the United States. For any regulated article moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories, cold treatment may be conducted either prior to movement to the mainland United States or in the mainland United States. Cold treatment facilities may be located in any State on the mainland United States. For cold treatment facilities located in the area south of 39° latitude and west of 104° longitude, the following additional conditions must be met:</P>
            <P>(i) Prospective facility operators must submit a detailed layout of the facility site and its location to APHIS. APHIS will evaluate plant health risks based on the proposed location and layout of the facility site. APHIS will only approve a proposed facility if the Administrator determines that regulated articles can be safely transported to the facility from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States.</P>
            <P>(ii) The government of the State in which the facility is to be located must concur in writing with the location of the facility or, if it does not concur, must provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks. In instances where the State government does not concur with the proposed facility location, and provides a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, APHIS and the State must agree on a strategy to resolve the pest risk concerns prior to APHIS approval. If the State does not provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, then State concurrence will not be required before APHIS approves the facility location.</P>
            <P>(iii) Untreated articles may not be removed from their packaging prior to treatment under any circumstances.</P>
            <P>(iv) The facility must have contingency plans, approved by APHIS, for safely destroying or disposing of regulated articles if the facility is unable to properly treat a shipment.</P>
            <P>(v) The facility may only treat articles approved by APHIS for treatment at the facility. Approved articles will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

            <P>(vi) Arrangements for treatment must be made before the departure of a consignment from its port of entry or points of origin in the United States. APHIS and the facility must agree on all parameters, such as time, routing, and conveyance, by which the consignment will move from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States to the treatment facility. If APHIS and the facility cannot reach agreement in advance on these parameters then no consignments may be moved to that facility until an agreement has been reached.<PRTPAGE P="176"/>
            </P>
            <P>(vii) Regulated articles must be conveyed to the facility in a refrigerated (via motorized refrigeration equipment) conveyance at a temperature that minimizes the mobility of the pests of concern for the article.</P>
            <P>(viii) The facility must apply all post-treatment safeguards required for certification under paragraph (a) of this section before releasing the articles.</P>
            <P>(ix) The facility must remain locked when not in operation.</P>
            <P>(x) The facility must maintain and provide APHIS with an updated map identifying places where horticultural or other crops are grown within 4 square miles of the facility. Proximity of host material to the facility will necessitate trapping or other pest monitoring activities, funded by the facility, to help prevent establishment of any escaped pests of concern, as approved by APHIS; these activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section. The treatment facility must have a pest management plan within the facility.</P>
            <P>(xi) The facility must comply with any additional requirements including, but not limited to, the use of pest-proof packaging and container seals, that APHIS may require to prevent the escape of plant pests during transport to and from the cold treatment facility itself, for a particular facility based on local conditions, and for any other risk factors of concern. These activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies, cold treatment facilities may be located either within or outside of the quarantined area. If the articles are treated outside the quarantined area, they must be accompanied to the facility by a limited permit issued in accordance with § 301.32-5(b) of this chapter and must be moved in accordance with any safeguards determined to be appropriate by APHIS.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Cold treatment enclosures.</E> All enclosures, in which cold treatment is performed, including refrigerated containers, must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be capable of maintaining the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another approved treatment schedule before the treatment begins and holding fruit at or below the treatment temperature during the treatment.</P>
            <P>(2) Maintain fruit pulp temperatures according to treatment schedules with no more than a 0.39 °C (0.7 °F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly readings.</P>
            <P>(3) Be structurally sound and adequate to maintain required temperatures.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Treatment procedures.</E> (1) All material, labor, and equipment for cold treatment performed on a vessel must be provided by the vessel or vessel agent. An official authorized by APHIS monitors, manages, and advises in order to ensure that the treatment procedures are followed.</P>
            <P>(2) Refrigeration must be completed in the container, compartment, or room in which it is begun.</P>
            <P>(3) Fruit that may be cold treated must be safeguarded to prevent cross-contamination or mixing with other infested fruit.</P>

            <P>(4) Fruit intended for in-transit cold treatment must be precooled to no more than the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated prior to beginning treatment. The in-transit treatment enclosure may not be used for precooling unless an official authorized by APHIS approves the loading of the fruit in the treatment enclosure as adequate to allow for fruit pulp temperatures to be taken prior to beginning treatment. If the fruit is precooled outside the treatment enclosure, an official authorized by APHIS will take pulp temperatures manually from a sample of the fruit as the fruit is loaded for in-transit cold treatment to verify that precooling was completed. If the pulp temperatures for the sample are 0.28 °C (0.5 °F) or more above the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated, the pallet from which the sample was taken will be rejected and returned for additional precooling until <PRTPAGE P="177"/>the fruit reaches the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated. If fruit is precooled in the treatment enclosure, or if treatment is conducted at a cold treatment facility in the United States, the fruit must be precooled to the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated, as verified by an official authorized by APHIS, prior to beginning treatment.</P>
            <P>(5) Breaks, damage, etc., in the treatment enclosure that preclude maintaining correct temperatures must be repaired before the enclosure is used. An official authorized by APHIS must approve loading of compartment, number and placement of temperature probes or sensors, and initial fruit temperature readings before beginning the treatment. Hanging decks and hatch coamings within vessels may not be used as enclosures for in-transit cold treatment without prior written approval from APHIS. Double-stacking of pallets is not allowed.</P>
            <P>(6) Only the same type of fruit in the same type of package may be treated together in a container; no mixture of fruits in containers may be treated. A numbered seal must be placed on the doors of the loaded container and may be removed only at the port of destination by an official authorized by APHIS.</P>
            <P>(7) Temperature recording devices used during treatment must be secured using measures approved by APHIS as adequate to ensure the security and integrity of cold treatment data. The devices must be able to record the date, time, and sensor number and automatic and continuous records of the temperature during all calibrations and during treatment. Recording devices must be capable of generating temperature charts for verification by an inspector. If records of calibrations or treatments are found to have been manipulated, the vessel or container in which the treatment is performed may be suspended from conducting cold treatments until proper equipment is installed and an official authorized by APHIS has recertified it. APHIS' decision to recertify a vessel or container will take into account the severity of the infraction that led to suspension.</P>
            <P>(8) A minimum of four temperature probes or sensors is required for vessel holds used as treatment enclosures. A minimum of three temperature probes or sensors is required for other treatment enclosures. An official authorized by APHIS will have the option to require that additional temperature probes or sensors be used, depending on the size of the treatment enclosure.</P>
            <P>(9) Fruit pulp temperatures must be maintained at the temperature specified in the treatment schedule with no more than a 0.39 °C (0.7 °F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly readings. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in invalidation of the treatment unless an official authorized by APHIS can verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.</P>
            <P>(10) The time required to complete the treatment begins when all temperature probes reach the prescribed cold treatment schedule temperature. Refrigeration continues until the vessel arrives at the port of destination and the fruit is released for unloading by an inspector even though this may prolong the period required for the cold treatment.</P>
            <P>(11) Temperatures must be recorded at intervals no longer than 1 hour apart. Gaps of longer than 1 hour will invalidate the treatment or indicate treatment failure unless an official authorized by APHIS can verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.</P>
            <P>(12) Cold treatment is not completed until so declared by an official authorized by APHIS or the certifying official of the foreign country; consignments of treated commodities may not be discharged until APHIS clearance has been fully completed, including review and approval of treatment record charts.</P>

            <P>(13) Cold treatment of fruits in break bulk vessels or containers must be initiated by an official authorized by APHIS if there is not a treatment technician who has been trained to initiate cold treatments for either break bulk vessels or containers.<PRTPAGE P="178"/>
            </P>
            <P>(14) An official authorized by APHIS may perform audits to ensure that the treatment procedures comply with the regulations in this section and that the treatment is administered in accordance with the treatment schedules in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in accordance with another approved treatment schedule. The official authorized by APHIS must be given the appropriate materials and access to the facility, container, or vessel necessary to perform the audits.</P>
            <P>(15) An inspector will sample and cut fruit from each consignment after it has been cold treated to monitor treatment effectiveness. If a single live pest of concern in any stage of development is found, the consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and appropriate remedial actions have been implemented. If APHIS determines at any time that the safeguards contained in this section do not appear to be effective against the pests of concern, APHIS may suspend the importation of fruits from the originating country and conduct an investigation into the cause of the deficiency. APHIS may waive the sampling and cutting requirement of paragraph (d)(15) of this section, provided that the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country has conducted such sampling and cutting in the exporting country as part of a biometric sampling protocol approved by APHIS.</P>
            <P>(16) The cold treatments required for the entry of fruit are considered necessary for the elimination of plant pests, and no liability shall attach to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in the event injury results to fruit offered for entry in accordance with these instructions. In prescribing cold treatments of certain fruits, it should be emphasized that inexactness and carelessness in applying the treatments may result in injury to the fruit or its rejection for entry.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> Treatment must be monitored by an inspector to ensure proper administration of the treatment. An inspector must also approve the recording devices and sensors used to monitor temperatures and conduct an operational check of the equipment before each use and ensure sensors are calibrated. An inspector may approve, adjust, or reject the treatment. Facilities must be located within the local commuting area for APHIS employees for inspection purposes. Facilities treating imported articles must also be located within an area over which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is assigned authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Compliance agreements.</E> Any person who operates a facility where cold treatment is conducted for phytosanitary purposes must sign a compliance agreement with APHIS.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Compliance agreements with importers and facility operators for cold treatment in the United States.</E> If cold treatment of imported articles is conducted in the United States, both the importer and the operator of the cold treatment facility or the person who conducts the cold treatment must sign compliance agreements with APHIS. In the importer compliance agreement, the importer must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to ensure the shipment is not diverted to a destination other than an approved treatment facility and to prevent escape of plant pests from the articles to be treated during their transit from the port of first arrival to the cold treatment facility in the United States. In the facility compliance agreement, the facility operator or person conducting the cold treatment must agree to comply with the requirements of this section and any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to prevent the escape of any pests of concern that may be associated with the articles to be treated.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Compliance agreements with cold treatment facilities outside the United States.</E> If cold treatment of imported articles is conducted outside the United States, the operator of the cold treatment facility must sign a compliance agreement or an equivalent agreement with APHIS and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located. In this agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with the requirements of this section, and the NPPO of the country in which the <PRTPAGE P="179"/>facility is located must agree to monitor that compliance and inform the Administrator of any noncompliance.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cold treatment facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. territories.</E> Cold treatment facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and the U.S. territories must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 318.13-3(d) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Location of facilities.</E> (1) Where certified irradiation facilities are available, an approved irradiation treatment may be conducted for any imported regulated article either prior to shipment to the United States or in the United States. For any regulated article moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories, irradiation treatment may be conducted either prior to movement to the mainland United States or in the mainland United States. Irradiation facilities may be located in any State on the mainland United States. For irradiation facilities located in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, the following additional conditions must be met:</P>
            <P>(i) Prospective facility operators must submit a detailed layout of the facility site and its location to APHIS. APHIS will evaluate plant health risks based on the proposed location and layout of the facility site. APHIS will only approve a proposed facility if the Administrator determines that regulated articles can be safely transported to the facility from port of entry or points of origin in the United States.</P>
            <P>(ii) The government of the State in which the facility is to be located must concur in writing with the location of the facility or, if it does not concur, must provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks. In instances where the State government does not concur with the proposed facility location, and provides a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, APHIS and the State must agree on a strategy to resolve the pest risk concerns prior to APHIS approval. If the State does not provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, then State concurrence will not be required before APHIS approves the facility location.</P>
            <P>(iii) Untreated articles may not be removed from their packaging prior to treatment under any circumstances.</P>
            <P>(iv) The facility must have contingency plans, approved by APHIS, for safely destroying or disposing of regulated articles if the facility is unable to properly treat a shipment.</P>
            <P>(v) The facility may only treat articles approved by APHIS for treatment at the facility. Approved articles will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>

            <P>(vi) Arrangements for treatment must be made before the departure of a consignment from its port of entry or points of origin in the United States. APHIS and the facility must agree on all parameters, such as time, routing, and conveyance, by which the consignment will move from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States to the treatment facility. If APHIS and the facility cannot reach agreement in advance on these parameters then no <PRTPAGE P="181"/>consignments may be moved to that facility until an agreement has been reached.</P>
            <P>(vii) Regulated articles must be conveyed to the facility in a refrigerated (via motorized refrigeration equipment or other methods including ice or insulation) or air-conditioned conveyance at a temperature that minimizes the mobility of the pests of concern for the article.</P>
            <P>(viii) The facility must maintain and provide APHIS with an updated map identifying places where horticultural or other crops are grown within 4 square miles of the facility. Proximity of host material to the facility will necessitate trapping or other pest monitoring activities to help prevent establishment of any escaped pests of concern, as approved by APHIS; these activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. The treatment facility must have a pest management plan within the facility.</P>
            <P>(ix) The facility must comply with any additional requirements that APHIS may require to prevent the escape of plant pests during transport to and from the irradiation facility itself, for a particular facility based on local conditions, and for any other risk factors of concern. These activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies, irradiation facilities may be located either within or outside of the quarantined area. If the articles are treated outside the quarantined area, they must be accompanied to the facility by a limited permit issued in accordance with § 301.32-5(b) of this chapter and must be moved in accordance with any safeguards determined to be appropriate by APHIS.</P>
            <P>(3) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined only for Asian citrus psyllid, and not for citrus greening, irradiation facilities must be located within an area that is not quarantined for citrus greening.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Approved facilities.</E> The irradiation treatment facility must be approved by APHIS. Other agencies that have regulatory oversight and requirements must concur in writing with the establishment of the facility prior to APHIS approval. In order to be approved, a facility must fulfill the requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance agreements.</E> Compliance agreements for facilities located in States listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may also contain additional provisions as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(ix) of this section. (1) <E T="03">Irradiation facilities treating imported articles.</E> (i) <E T="03">Compliance agreements with importers and facility operators for irradiation in the United States.</E> If irradiation of imported articles is conducted in the United States, both the importer and the operator of the irradiation facility must sign compliance agreements with APHIS. In the facility compliance agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to prevent the escape, prior to irradiation, of any pests of concern that may be associated with the articles to be irradiated. In the importer compliance agreement, the importer must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to ensure the shipment is not diverted to a destination other than an approved treatment facility and to prevent escape of plant pests from the articles to be irradiated during their transit from the port of first arrival to the irradiation facility in the United States.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Compliance agreement with irradiation facilities outside the United States.</E> If irradiation of imported articles is conducted outside the United States, the operator of the irradiation facility must sign a compliance agreement with APHIS and the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the country in which the facility is located. In this agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with the requirements of this section, and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located must agree to monitor that compliance and to inform the Administrator of any noncompliance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. <PRTPAGE P="182"/>territories.</E> Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. territories must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 318.13-3(d) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies.</E> Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 301.32-6 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(4) Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined only for Asian citrus psyllid, and not for citrus greening, must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 301.76-8 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certified facility.</E> The irradiation treatment facility must be certified by APHIS. Recertification is required in the event of an increase in the amount of radioisotope, a decrease in the amount of radioisotope for a reason other than natural decay, a major modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose, or a change in the owner or managing entity of the facility. Recertification also may be required in cases where a significant variance in dose delivery has been measured by the dosimetry system. In order to be certified, a facility must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be capable of administering the minimum absorbed ionizing radiation doses specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another treatment schedule approved in accordance with § 305.2 to the regulated articles;<SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/>
            </P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> The maximum absorbed ionizing radiation dose and the irradiation of food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under 21 CFR part 179.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(2) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations for treated and untreated articles, except that articles traveling by conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber may pass through an area that would otherwise be separated. The locations must be separated by a permanent physical barrier such as a wall or chain link fence 6 or more feet high to prevent transfer of cartons, or some other means approved during certification to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of pests.</P>
            <P>(3) If the facility is to be used to treat imported articles and is located in the United States, the facility will only be certified if APHIS determines that regulated articles will be safely transported to the facility from the port of arrival without significant risk that plant pests will escape in transit or while the regulated articles are at the facility.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Monitoring and interagency agreements.</E> Treatment must be monitored by an inspector. This monitoring will include inspection of treatment records and unannounced inspections of the facility by an inspector, and may include inspection of articles prior to or after irradiation. Facilities must be located within the local commuting area for APHIS employees for inspection purposes.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Irradiation facilities treating imported articles; irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan.</E> Facilities shall be located within an area over which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is assigned authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force. The NPPO of a country from which articles are to be imported into the United States in accordance with this section must sign a framework equivalency workplan with APHIS. In this plan, both the NPPO and APHIS will specify the following items for their respective countries:</P>
            <P>(A) Citations for any requirements that apply to the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables;</P>
            <P>(B) The type and amount of inspection, monitoring, or other activities that will be required in connection with allowing the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables into that country; and</P>
            <P>(C) Any other conditions that must be met to allow the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables into that country.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Irradiation facilities located in foreign countries.</E> Facilities in foreign countries that carry out irradiation operations must notify the Director of Preclearance, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-<PRTPAGE P="183"/>1236, of scheduled operations at least 30 days before operations commence, except where otherwise provided in the facility preclearance workplan. To ensure the appropriate level of monitoring, before articles may be imported in accordance with this section, the following agreements must be signed, in addition to the irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Facility preclearance workplan.</E> Prior to commencing importation into the United States of articles treated at a foreign irradiation facility, APHIS and the NPPO of the country from which articles are to be imported must jointly develop a preclearance workplan that details the activities that APHIS and the foreign NPPO will carry out in connection with each irradiation facility to verify the facility's compliance with the requirements of this section. Typical activities to be described in this workplan may include frequency of visits to the facility by APHIS and foreign plant protection inspectors, methods for reviewing facility records, and methods for verifying that facilities are in compliance with the requirements for separation of articles, packaging, labeling, and other requirements of this section. This facility preclearance workplan will be reviewed and renewed by APHIS and the foreign NPPO on an annual basis.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Trust fund agreement.</E> Irradiated articles may be imported into the United States in accordance with this section only if the NPPO of the country in which the irradiation facility is located or a private export group has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS. That agreement requires the NPPO or the private export group to pay, in advance of each shipping season, all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing inspection and treatment monitoring services at the irradiation facility during that shipping season. Those costs include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement will describe the general nature and scope of APHIS services provided at irradiation facilities covered by the agreement, such as whether APHIS inspectors will monitor operations continuously or intermittently, and will generally describe the extent of inspections APHIS will perform on articles prior to and after irradiation. The agreement requires the NPPO or private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the NPPO or the private export group to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before any more articles irradiated in that country may be imported into the United States. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO or the private export group or held on account until needed, at the option of the NPPO or the private export group.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Irradiation facilities located within the United States.</E> Facilities located within the United States must notify an inspector at least 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and Federal holidays) before scheduled operations. <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> If the facility will be used to treat imported articles, the NPPO of the country from which the articles are to be imported into the United States in accordance with this section must also sign the irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> Inspectors are assigned to local offices of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which are listed in telephone directories.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Packaging.</E> Articles that are irradiated in accordance with this section must be packaged in cartons in the following manner:</P>
            <P>(1) Irradiated articles may not be packaged for shipment in a carton with nonirradiated articles.</P>

            <P>(2) For all imported articles irradiated prior to arrival in the United States, all articles moved interstate <PRTPAGE P="184"/>from Hawaii or U.S. territories and irradiated prior to arrival in the mainland United States, and all regulated articles to be moved interstate from an area quarantined for fruit flies or Asian citrus psyllid that are treated within the quarantined area:</P>
            <P>(i) The fruits and vegetables must be packaged either:</P>
            <P>(A) In insect-proof cartons that have no openings that will allow the entry of the pests of concern. The cartons must be sealed with seals that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. The cartons may be constructed of any material that prevents entry or oviposition (if applicable) by the pests of concern into the articles in the carton;<SU>3</SU>
              <FTREF/> or</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>3</SU> If there is a question as to the adequacy of a carton, send a request for approval of the carton, together with a sample carton, to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Inspection and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606-5202.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(B) In noninsect-proof cartons that are stored immediately after irradiation in a room completely enclosed by walls or screening that completely precludes access by the pests of concern. If stored in noninsect-proof cartons in a room that precludes access by the pests of concern, prior to leaving the room, each pallet of cartons must be completely enclosed in polyethylene shrink wrap, or another solid or netting covering that completely precludes access to the cartons by the pests of concern.</P>
            <P>(ii) To preserve the integrity of treated lots, each pallet-load of cartons containing the fruits and vegetables must be secured before leaving the irradiation facility in one of the following ways:</P>
            <P>(A) With polyethylene shrink wrap;</P>
            <P>(B) With net wrapping; or</P>
            <P>(C) With strapping.</P>
            <P>(iii) Packaging must be labeled in a manner that allows an inspector to determine treatment lot numbers, packing and treatment facility identification and location, and dates of packing and treatment.</P>
            <P>(A) For imported articles that are treated prior to arrival in the United States, pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into the United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the United States, or that will be broken apart into smaller units after entry into the United States, must have the required label information on each individual carton.</P>
            <P>(B) For articles moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories that are treated prior to arrival in the mainland United States, pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into the mainland United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the mainland United States, or that will be broken apart into smaller units after entry into the mainland United States, must have the required label information on each individual carton.</P>
            <P>(3) For all articles imported to be irradiated upon arrival in the United States, moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories to be irradiated upon arrival in the mainland United States, or moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies or Asian citrus psyllid to be irradiated outside the quarantined area, the articles must be packed in cartons that have no openings that will allow the exit of the pests of concern and that are sealed with seals that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. They may be constructed of any material that prevents the pests of concern from exiting the carton. Cartons of untreated articles must be shipped in shipping containers sealed prior to their shipment with seals that will visually indicate if the shipping containers have been opened.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Containers or vans.</E> Containers or vans that will transport treated articles must be free of pests of concern prior to loading the treated articles.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Certification of treatment for articles treated outside the United States.</E> For each consignment treated in an irradiation facility outside the United States, a phytosanitary certificate, with the treatment section completed and issued by the NPPO, must accompany the consignment.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Dosage.</E> The regulated articles must receive the minimum absorbed ionizing radiation dose specified in the <PRTPAGE P="185"/>PPQ Treatment Manual or in another approved treatment schedule.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Dosimetry systems at the irradiation facility.</E> (1) Dosimetry must indicate the doses needed to ensure that all the articles will receive the minimum dose prescribed.</P>
            <P>(2) The absorbed dose, as measured using an accurate dosimetry system, must meet or exceed the absorbed dose for the pest(s) of concern required by the PPQ Treatment Manual or by another approved treatment schedule.</P>
            <P>(3) When designing the facility's dosimetry system and procedures for its operation, the facility operator must address guidance and principles from the International Standards Organization/American Society for Testing and Materials standard <SU>4</SU>
              <FTREF/> or an equivalent standard recognized by APHIS.</P>

            </FTNT>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Records.</E> An irradiation processor must maintain records of each treated lot for 1 year following the treatment date, and must make these records available for inspection by an inspector during normal business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). These records must include the lot identification, scheduled process, evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution in the product, and the date of irradiation.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Request for initial certification and inspection of facility.</E> Persons requesting initial certification of an irradiation treatment facility must submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Inspection and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606-5202. The initial request must identify the owner, location, and radiation source of the facility, and the applicant must supply additional information about the facility construction, treatment protocols, and operations upon request by APHIS if APHIS requires additional information to evaluate the request. Before the Administrator determines whether an irradiation facility is eligible for certification, an inspector will make a personal inspection of the facility to determine whether it complies with the standards of this section.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Denial and withdrawal of certification.</E> (1) The Administrator will withdraw the certification of any irradiation treatment facility upon written request from the irradiation processor.</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator will deny or withdraw certification of an irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not met. Before withdrawing or denying certification, the Administrator will inform the irradiation processor in writing of the reasons for the proposed action and provide the irradiation processor with an opportunity to respond. The Administrator will give the irradiation processor an opportunity for a hearing regarding any dispute of a material fact, in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted for the proceeding. However, the Administrator will suspend certification pending final determination in the proceeding if he or she determines that suspension is necessary to prevent the spread of any dangerous insect. The suspension will be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the irradiation processor. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will be given to the irradiation processor within 10 days of the oral notification. The suspension will continue in effect pending completion of the proceeding and any judicial review of the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Department not responsible for damage.</E> This treatment is approved to assure quarantine security against the plant pests listed in the PPQ Treatment Manual or the plant pests for which another treatment schedule is approved in accordance with § 305.2. From the literature available, the articles authorized for treatment under this section are believed tolerant to the treatment; however, the facility operator and shipper are responsible for determination of tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its inspectors assume no responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from any <PRTPAGE P="186"/>treatment prescribed or monitored. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring that irradiation facilities are constructed and operated in a safe manner. Further, the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that irradiated foods are safe and wholesome for human consumption.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Substitution of irradiation for other treatments.</E> Treatment of fruits and vegetables that are from foreign localities, from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, or from domestic areas under quarantine with irradiation in accordance with this section may be substituted for other approved treatments if the target pests of the other approved treatments are approved for treatment with irradiation in the PPQ Treatment Manual or approved for treatment with irradiation in accordance with § 305.2.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Withdrawal of certification, transit permits, limited permits, or compliance agreements.</E> Any certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector orally or in writing, if such inspector determines that the holder thereof has not complied with all conditions under the regulations for the <PRTPAGE P="190"/>use of such document.

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Costs and charges.</E> Services of the inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty at the usual places of duty shall be furnished without cost to the one requesting such services.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other fruits and vegetables.</E> Fruits and vegetables not already authorized for interstate movement as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be authorized for interstate movement only after:</P>
              <P>(i) APHIS has analyzed the pest risk posed by the interstate movement of a fruit or vegetable and has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures;</P>

              <P>(ii) APHIS has made its pest risk analysis and determination available for public comment for at least 60 days through a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; and</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Changes to phytosanitary measures.</E> (i) If the Administrator determines that the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized interstate movement under this subpart are no longer sufficient to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict interstate movement of the fruit or vegetable. APHIS will also publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> advising the public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended interstate movement requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and invite public comment on the subject.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Administrator determines that any of the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized interstate movement under this subpart are no longer necessary to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will make new pest risk documentation available for public comment, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, prior to allowing interstate movement of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.</P>

In other cases, fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of one or more plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable and the risk posed by the remaining plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application of standards for pest-free areas.</E> APHIS will make a determination of an area's pest-free status based on information provided by the State. The information used to make this determination will include trapping and surveillance data, survey protocols, and protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest.<PRTPAGE P="192"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Survey protocols.</E> APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of pest freedom.</E> (1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for a public comment period of 60 days, that the area meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. If appropriate, APHIS will allow movement of the regulated article from a pest-free area because:</P>
              <P>(i) No comments were received on the notice or</P>
              <P>(ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement.</E> If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn and that interstate movement of host crops for the pest in question is subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, interstate movement of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">General requirements for the interstate movement of regulated articles from pest-free areas</E>—(1) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> Each box of fruits or vegetables that is moved interstate from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The name of the municipality and State or territory in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The type and amount of fruits or vegetables the box contains.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Compliance agreement.</E> Persons wishing to move fruits or vegetables from a pest-free area in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with § 318.13-3(d).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Safeguarding.</E> If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent movement into or through the United States. These safeguards described in this section must remain intact until the fruits or vegetables reach their final destination.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Handling of fruits and vegetables.</E> Fruits or vegetables shipped through the United States from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands in accordance with this section may not be commingled in the same sealed container with fruits or vegetables that are intended for entry and distribution in the United States. The fruits or vegetables must be kept in sealed containers from the time the limited permit required by paragraph (b) of this section is issued, until the fruits or vegetables exit the United States, except as otherwise provided in the regulations in this section. Transloading must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (h), and (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Area of movement.</E> The port of arrival, the port of export, ports for air stops, and overland movement within the continental United States of fruits or vegetables shipped under this section is limited to a corridor that includes all States of the continental United States except Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, except that movement is allowed through Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, as an authorized stop for air cargo, or as a transloading location for consignments that arrive by air but that are subsequently transloaded into trucks for overland movement from Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, into the designated corridor by the shortest route. Movement through the United States must begin and end at locations staffed by APHIS inspectors.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Movement of regulated articles.</E> Transportation through the continental United States shall be by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment in the country to which it is exported, as determined by APHIS based on commercial shipping routes and timetables and set forth in the transit permit. No change in the quantity of the original consignment from that described in the limited permit is allowed. No remarking is allowed. No diversion or delay of the consignment from the itinerary described in the transit permit and limited permit is allowed unless authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the change will not significantly increase the risk of plant pests or diseases in the United States, and unless each port to which the consignment is diverted is staffed by APHIS inspectors.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notification in case of emergency.</E> In the case of an emergency such as an accident, a mechanical breakdown of the means of conveyance, or an unavoidable deviation from the prescribed route, the person in charge of the means of conveyance must, as soon as practicable, notify the APHIS office at the port where the cargo arrived in the United States.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Consignments by sea.</E> Except as authorized by this paragraph, consignments arriving in the United States by sea from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands may be transloaded once from a ship to another ship or, alternatively, once to a truck or railcar at the port of arrival and once from a truck or railcar to a ship at the port of export, and must remain in the original sealed container, except under extenuating circumstances and when authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (<E T="03">e.g.</E> , equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision.<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Consignments by air.</E> (1) Consignments arriving in the United States by air from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands may be transloaded only once in the United States. Transloading of air consignments must be carried out in the presence of an APHIS inspector. Consignments arriving by air that are transloaded may be transloaded either into another aircraft or into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment through the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the second air stop within the designated corridor, as authorized in the transit permit and as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision. Transloading of air consignments will be authorized only if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The transloading is done into sealable containers;</P>

              <P>(ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the airport (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, that area of the airport that is open only to personnel authorized by the airport security authorities);</P>
              <P>(iii) The area used for any storage is within the secure area of the airport; and</P>
              <P>(iv) APHIS inspectors are available to provide the supervision required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Except as authorized by paragraph (f) of this section, consignments that continue by air from the port of arrival in the continental United States may be authorized by APHIS for only one additional stop in the continental United States, provided the second stop is within the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and is staffed by APHIS inspectors. As an alternative to transloading a consignment arriving in the United States into another aircraft, consignments that arrive by air may be transloaded into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment through the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the second authorized air stop within the designated corridor. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Duration and location of storage.</E> Any storage in the United States of fruits or vegetables shipped under this section must be for a duration and in a location authorized in the transit permit required by paragraph (a) of this section. Areas where such fruits or vegetables are stored must be either locked or guarded at all times the fruits and vegetables are present. Cargo shipped under this section must be kept in a sealed container while stored in the continental United States.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Temperature requirement.</E> Except for time spent on aircraft and except during storage and transloading of air consignments, the temperature in the sealed containers containing fruits and vegetables moved under this section must be 60 °F or lower from the time the regulated articles leave Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States until they exit the United States.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Prohibited materials.</E> (1) The person in charge of or in possession of a sealed container used for movement into or through the United States under this section must ensure that the sealed container is carrying only those fruits or vegetables authorized by the transit <PRTPAGE P="196"/>permit required under paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) The person in charge of or in possession of any means of conveyance or container returned to the United States without being reloaded after being used to export fruits or vegetables from the United States under this section must ensure that the means of conveyance or container is free of materials prohibited importation into the United States under this chapter.</P>
              <P>(m) Authorization by APHIS of the movement of fruits or vegetables through the United States under this section does not imply that such fruits or vegetables are enterable into the destination country. Consignments returned to the United States from the destination country shall be subject to all applicable regulations, including “Subpart L—Fruits and Vegetables ” of part 319 and “Plant Quarantine Safeguard Regulations” of part 352 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(n) Any restrictions and requirements with respect to the arrival, temporary stay, unloading, transloading, transiting, exportation, or other movement or possession in the United States of any fruits or vegetables under this section shall apply to any person who brings into, maintains, unloads, transloads, transports, exports, or otherwise moves or possesses in the United States such fruits or vegetables, whether or not that person is the one who was required to have a transit permit or limited permit for the fruits or vegetables or is a subsequent custodian of the fruits or vegetables. Failure to comply with all applicable restrictions and requirements under this section by such a person shall be deemed to be a violation of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The grower's production area must be inspected annually by an inspector and found free of green scale. If green scale is found during an inspection, a 2-month ban will be placed on the interstate movement of cut blooms of gardenia from that production area. Near the end of the 2 months, an inspector will reinspect the grower's production area to determine whether green scale is present. If reinspection determines that the production area is free of green scale, shipping may resume. If reinspection determines that green scale is still present in the production area, another 2-month ban on shipping will be placed on the interstate movement of gardenia from that production area. Each ban will be followed by reinspection in the manner specified, and the production area must be found free of green scale prior to interstate movement.</P>

              <P>(2) The grower must establish a buffer area surrounding gardenia production areas. The buffer area must extend 20 feet from the edge of the production area. Within the buffer area, the growing of gardenias and the following green scale host plants is prohibited: Ixora, ginger (<E T="03">Alpinia purpurata</E>), plumeria, coffee, rambutan, litchi, guava, citrus, anthurium, avocado, banana, cocoa, macadamia, celery, <E T="03">Pluchea indica,</E> mango, orchids, and annona.</P>

If the inspector does not detect green scale in the consignment, the inspector will certify the consignment in accordance with § 318.13-3(b). If the inspector finds green scale in a consignment, that consignment will be ineligible for interstate movement from Hawaii.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for submitting requests and supporting information.</E> Persons who request changes to the import regulations contained in this part and who wish to import plants, plant parts, or plant products that are not allowed importation under the conditions of this part must file a request with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in order for APHIS to consider whether the new commodity can be safely imported into the United States. The initial request can be formal (e.g., a letter) or informal (e.g., made during a bilateral discussion between the United States and another country), and can be made by any person. Upon APHIS confirmation that granting a person's request would require amendments to the regulations in this part, the national plant protection organization of the country from which the commodity would be exported must provide APHIS with the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section before APHIS can proceed with its consideration of the request; requests that are not supported with this information in a timely manner will be considered incomplete and APHIS may not take further action on such requests until all required information is submitted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Addresses.</E> The national plant protection organization of the country from which commodities would be exported must submit the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section to: Commodity Import Analysis and Operations, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737.</P>

The regulations in this subpart provide a process under which a controlled import permit (CIP) may be issued to authorize the importation, for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes, of an article whose importation is prohibited under this part. A CIP may also be issued to authorize, for those same purposes, the importation of an article under conditions that differ from those prescribed in the relevant regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application process.</E> Applications for a CIP are available without charge from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Permit Unit, 4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or from local PPQ offices. Applications may be submitted by mail, by fax, or electronically and must be submitted at least 60 days prior to arrival of the article at the port of entry. Mailed applications must be submitted to the address above, faxed applications may be submitted to 301-734-4300, and electronic applications may be submitted through the ePermits Web site at <E T="03">https://epermits.aphis.usda.gov/epermits.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The completed application for a CIP must provide the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Name, address in the United States, and contact information of the applicant;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identity (common and botanical [genus and species] names) of the plant material to be imported, quantity of importation, country of origin, and country shipped from;</P>
              <P>(iii) Intended experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purpose for the importation; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Intended ports of export and entry, means of conveyance, and estimated date of arrival.</P>
              <P>(2) APHIS may issue a CIP if the Administrator determines that the plant pest risks associated with the plant material and its intended experimental, therapeutic, or developmental use can be effectively mitigated. The CIP will contain the applicable conditions for importation and subsequent handling of the plant material if it is deemed eligible to be imported into the United States, including the specifications for the facility where the plant will be held. The plant material may be imported only if all applicable requirements are met.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Shipping conditions.</E> Consignments of plant material to be offered for importation under a CIP must meet the following requirements, unless otherwise specified under the conditions of the CIP:</P>
              <P>(1) The plant material must be selected from apparently disease-free and pest-free sources.</P>
              <P>(2) The plant material must be free of soil, other foreign matter or debris, other prohibited plants, noxious weed seeds, and living organisms such as parasitic plants, pathogens, insects, snails, and mites.</P>
              <P>(3) Fungicides, insecticides, and other treatments such as coatings, dips, or sprayings must not be applied before shipment, unless otherwise specified. Plant materials may be refused entry if they are difficult or hazardous to inspect because of the presence of such treatments. Plant materials must not be wrapped or otherwise packaged in a manner that impedes or prevents adequate inspection or treatment.</P>

              <P>(4) The plant material must be moved in an enclosed container or one completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent the possible escape or introduction of plant pests during shipment. Any packing material used in the consignment of the plant material must meet the requirements of § 319.37-11, and wood packing material used in the consignment must meet the requirements of § 319.40-3(b) and (c).<PRTPAGE P="211"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Consignments may be shipped as cargo, by mail or air freight, or hand-carried, as specified in the conditions of the CIP.</P>
              <P>(6) The plant material must be offered for importation at the port of entry or plant inspection station as specified in the conditions of the CIP.</P>
              <P>(7) A copy of the CIP must accompany each consignment, and all consignments must be labeled in accordance with instructions in the CIP.</P>
              <P>(8) Each consignment must be accompanied by an invoice or packing list indicating its contents.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Post-importation conditions.</E> (1) At the approved facility where the plant material will be maintained following its importation, plant material imported under a CIP must be identified and labeled as quarantined material to be used only in accordance with a valid CIP.</P>

During regular business hours, properly identified officials, either Federal or State, must be allowed to inspect the plant material and the facilities in which the plant material is maintained.</P>
              <P>(3) The permit holder must keep the permit valid for the duration of the authorized experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purpose. The PPQ Permit Unit must be informed of a change in contact information for the permit holder within 10 business days of such change.</P>
              <P>(4) Plant material imported under a CIP must not be moved or distributed to another person without prior authorization from the PPQ Permit Unit.</P>
              <P>(5) Should the permit holder leave the institution in which the plant material imported under a CIP is kept, the plant material must be destroyed unless, prior to the departure of the original permit holder, another person assumes responsibility for the continued maintenance of the plant material and such person obtains a new CIP for the plant material. Should the permit holder be otherwise unavailable to maintain the plant material for which the CIP was issued, the plant material must be destroyed unless another person assumes responsibility for the continued maintenance of the plant material and such person obtains a new CIP for the plant material. Permission to move or distribute plant material that was authorized for importation under a CIP to another person must be obtained by contacting the PPQ Permit Unit.</P>
              <P>(6) CIPs issued by APHIS are valid for a period of 1 year. The permittee may request the existing permit be renewed for up to an additional 2 years prior to the expiration of the CIP and if no adverse indications exist from the previous year.</P>
              <P>(f) Failure to comply with all of the conditions specified in the CIP or any applicable regulations or administrative instructions, or forging, counterfeiting, or defacing permits or shipping labels, may result in immediate revocation of the permit, denial of future permits, and civil or criminal penalties for the permit holder.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Denial, withdrawal, cancellation, or revocation of permit.</E> The Administrator may deny a permit application in accordance with § 319.7-3, and a permit may be withdrawn, canceled, or revoked in accordance with § 319.7-4.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Action upon cancellation or revocation of permit.</E> Upon cancellation or revocation of a permit, the permittee must surrender, destroy, or remove all regulated plant material covered by the permit in accordance with § 319.7-4(e).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Appeal of denial or revocation.</E> Any person whose application for a permit has been denied or whose permit has been revoked may appeal the denial or revocation in accordance with § 319.7-5.</P>

                <P>(a) Pursuant to sections 411-414 and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711-7714 and 7754), the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that the unrestricted importation into the United States from all foreign countries and localities of any parts or products of plants of the genus <E T="03">Gossypium,</E> including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and other forms of cotton fiber (not including yarn, thread, and cloth); cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed products, except oil; cotton waste, including gin waste and thread waste; any other unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; second-hand burlap and other fabrics, shredded or otherwise, that have been used or are of the kinds ordinarily used, for containing cotton, grains (including grain products), field seeds, agricultural roots, rhizomes, tubers, or other underground crops, may result in the entry into the United States of the pink bollworm (<E T="03">Pectinophora gossypiella</E> (Saund.)), the golden nematode of potatoes (<E T="03">Heterodera rostochiensis</E> Wr.), the flag smut disease (<E T="03">Urocystis tritici</E> Koern.), and other injurious plant diseases and insect pests. Accordingly, to prevent the introduction into the United States of plant pests, the importation of those articles into the United States is prohibited unless they are imported in accordance with the regulations in this subpart or their importation has been authorized for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes by a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6.</P>

                <P>(a) Entry of covers (including bags, slit bags, and parts of bags) which have been used as containers for cotton grown or processed in countries other than the United States may be authorized either (1) through a Mexican border port named in the permit for vacuum fumigation by an approved method in that part of the United States within the generally infested pink bollworm regulated area; or (2) through a northern port or a port in the State of California subject to vacuum fumigation by an approved method or without vacuum fumigation when the covers are to be moved to an approved mill or plant for utilization. When such covers are forwarded from a northern port to a mill or plant in California for utilization, or from a California port to another California or northern port for vacuum fumigation thereat or for movement to a mill or plant for utilization such movement shall be made by an all-water route unless the bales are compressed to a density of 20 pounds or more per cubic foot in which case the bales may be moved overland in van-type trucks or box cars if all-water transportation is not available. Such overland movement may be made only after approved surface treatment or under such other conditions as may be deemed necessary and are prescribed by the inspector. When such covers arrive at a port other than a northern, California, or Mexican border port they will be required to be transported therefrom immediately in bond by an all-water route to a northern or California port where approved vacuum fumigation facilities are available for <PRTPAGE P="223"/>vacuum fumigation thereat by an approved method or for forwarding therefrom to an approved mill or plant for utilization.</P>
                <P>(b) American cotton bagging, commonly known as coarse gunny, which has been used to cover only cotton grown or processed in the United States, may be authorized entry at any port under permit and upon compliance with §§ 319.8-4 and 319.8-5, without fumigation or other treatment. Marking patches of the finer burlaps or other fabrics when attached to bales of such bagging may be disregarded if, in the judgment of the inspector, they do not present a risk of carrying live pink bollworms, golden nematode cysts or flag smut spores.</P>

                <P>(c) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers which have been used as containers for root crops or are of a kind ordinarily used as containers for root crops may be authorized entry subject to immediate treatment in such manner and according to such method as the inspector may select from administratively authorized procedures known to be effective under the conditions under which the treatment is applied, and subject to any additional safeguard measures that may be prescribed by the inspector pursuant to § 319.8-24, or that he may prescribe in regard to the manner of discharge from the carrier and conveyance to the place of treatment: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such covers may be authorized entry from Canada without treatment as prescribed in this paragraph unless the covers are found to be contaminated.</P>
                <P>(d) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers that have been used as containers for wheat or wheat products that have not been so processed as to have destroyed all flag smut disease spores, or that have been used as containers for field seeds separated from wheat during the process of screening, and which arrive from a country named in § 319.59-2(a)(2) of this part, if intended for reuse in this country as grain containers may be authorized entry, subject to immediate treatment at the port of arrival. If such covers are not intended to be reused in this country as grain containers their entry may be authorized subject to movement for utilization to an approved mill or plant the owner or operator of which has executed an appropriate agreement with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs similar to that described in § 319.8-8(a)(2). Covers coming within this paragraph only, may be entered without permit other than the authorization provided in this paragraph and without other restriction under this subpart upon presentation to an inspector of satisfactory evidence that they have been used only for grains exported from the United States and are being returned empty without use abroad and that while abroad they have been handled in a manner to prevent their contamination.</P>
                <P>(e) When upon arrival at a port of entry any shipment of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, or other covers, is found to include one or more bales containing material the importation of which is regulated by paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section, the entire shipment, or any portion thereof, may be required by the inspector to be treated as specified in the applicable paragraph.</P>
                <P>(f) If upon their arrival at a port of entry covers are classified by the inspector as coming within more than one paragraph of this section, they will be authorized entry only upon compliance with such requirements of the applicable paragraphs as the inspector may deem necessary to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect pests.</P>
                <P>(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other paragraph of this section the entry from any country of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers will be authorized without treatment but upon compliance with other applicable sections of this subpart if the inspector finds that they have obviously not been used in a manner that would contaminate them or when in the inspector's opinion there is otherwise no plant pest risk associated with their entry.</P>

              <P>(a) Under section 412(a) of the Plant Protection Act, the Secretary of Agriculture may prohibit or restrict the importation and entry of any plant or plant product if the Secretary determines that the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the introduction into the United States or the dissemination within the United States of a plant pest or noxious weed.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary has determined that it is necessary to designate the importation of certain taxa of plants for planting as not authorized pending pest risk analysis, as provided in § 319.37-4. The Secretary has determined that it is necessary to restrict the importation into the United States of all other plants for planting and to impose additional restrictions on the importation of specific types of plants for planting, in accordance with this subpart and as described in the Plants for Planting Manual.</P>
              <P>(c) The importation of plants that are imported for processing or consumption, as determined by an inspector based on documentation accompanying the articles, is not subject to this subpart but may be subject to restrictions elsewhere in this part.</P>

              <P>(d) The importation of taxa of plants for planting that are listed in parts 360 and 361 of this chapter is subject to the restrictions in those parts.<PRTPAGE P="230"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs also enforces regulations promulgated under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544) which contain additional prohibitions and restrictions on importation into the United States of plants for planting subject to this subpart (see 50 CFR parts 17 and 23).</P>
              <P>(f) Within the Plants for Planting Manual, one or more common names of plants for planting may be given in parentheses after most scientific names (when common names are known) for the purpose of helping to identify the plants for planting represented by such scientific names; however, unless otherwise specified, a reference to a scientific name includes all plants for planting within the taxon represented by the scientific name regardless of whether the common name or names are as comprehensive in scope as the scientific name. When restrictions apply to the importation of a taxon of plants for planting for which there are taxonomic synonyms, those restrictions apply to the importation of all the synonyms of that taxon as well.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Taxa of plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination by the Administrator.</E> The importation of certain taxa of plants for planting poses a risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States. Therefore, the importation of these taxa is not authorized pending the completion of a pest risk <PRTPAGE P="233"/>analysis, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. These taxa are listed in the Plants for Planting Manual. There are two categories of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis: Taxa of plants for planting that are quarantine pests, and taxa of plants for planting that are hosts of quarantine pests. For taxa of plants for planting that have been determined to be quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa. For taxa of plants for planting that are hosts of quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa, the foreign places from which the taxa's importation is not authorized, and the quarantine pests of concern.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Addition of taxa.</E> A taxon of plants for planting may be added to one of the lists of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis under this section as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Data sheet.</E> APHIS will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a document that announces our determination that a taxon of plants for planting is either a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest. This notice will make available a data sheet that details the scientific evidence APHIS evaluated in making the determination that the taxon is a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest. The data sheet will include references to the scientific evidence that APHIS used in making the determination. In our notice, we will provide for a public comment period of a minimum of 60 days on our additions to the list.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Response to comments.</E> (i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the taxon will be added to the list of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis if:</P>
              <P>(A) No comments were received on the data sheet;</P>
              <P>(B) The comments on the data sheet revealed that no changes to the data sheet were necessary; or</P>
              <P>(C) Changes to the data sheet were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect APHIS' determination that the taxon poses a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.</P>
              <P>(ii) If comments present information that leads us to determine that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States, APHIS will not add the taxon to the list of plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis. APHIS will issue a notice giving public notice of this determination after the close of the comment period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Criterion for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a quarantine pest.</E> A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a quarantine pest.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Criteria for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a host of a quarantine pest.</E> A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a host of a quarantine pest. The following criteria must be fulfilled in order to make this determination:</P>
              <P>(1) The plant pest in question must be determined to be a quarantine pest; and</P>
              <P>(2) The taxon of plants for planting must be determined to be a host of that quarantine pest.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Removing a taxon from the list of taxa not authorized pending pest risk analysis.</E> (1) Requests to remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis (NAPPRA) must be made in accordance with § 319.5. APHIS will conduct a pest risk analysis in response to such a request. The pest risk analysis will examine the risk associated with the importation of that taxon as well as measures available to mitigate that risk. The pest risk analysis may analyze importation of the taxon from a specific area, country, or countries, or from all areas of the world. The conclusions of the pest risk analysis will apply accordingly.</P>

              <P>(2) If the pest risk analysis indicates that the taxon is a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest and the Administrator determines that there are no measures available that adequately mitigate the risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States through the taxon's importation, we <PRTPAGE P="234"/>will continue to list the taxon as not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis. We will publish a notice making the pest risk analysis available for comment. If comments cause us to change our determination, we will publish another notice in accordance with either paragraph (e)(3) or (4) of this section, as appropriate. If comments do not cause us to change our determination, we will publish a second notice responding to the comments and affirming our determination that the taxon should continue to be listed as NAPPRA.</P>
              <P>(3) If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to taxon-specific restrictions, APHIS will publish a notice making the pest risk analysis available to the public for comment in accordance with the process in § 319.37-20(c).</P>
              <P>(4) If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to the general restrictions of this subpart, APHIS will publish a notice announcing our intent to remove the taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis and making the pest risk analysis supporting the taxon's removal available for public comment.</P>
              <P>(i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will be subject only to the general restrictions of this subpart if:</P>
              <P>(A) No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;</P>
              <P>(B) The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or</P>
              <P>(C) Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions of the analysis and the Administrator's determination that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.</P>
              <P>(ii) If information presented by commenters indicates that the pest risk analysis needs to be revised, APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will continue to be listed as not authorized pending pest risk analysis while the information presented by commenters is analyzed and incorporated into the pest risk analysis. APHIS will subsequently publish a new notice announcing the availability of the revised pest risk analysis.</P>
              <P>(5) APHIS may also remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis when APHIS determines that the evidence used to add the taxon to the list was erroneous (for example, involving a taxonomic misidentification).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Controlled import permits.</E> Any plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis in accordance with this section may be imported or offered for entry into the United States if:</P>
              <P>(1) Imported for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes under the conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6;</P>
              <P>(2) Imported at the National Plant Germplasm Inspection Station, Building 580, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705 or through any USDA plant inspection station listed in the Plants for Planting Manual;</P>

              <P>If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of plants for planting and APHIS services are to be funded by the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time APHIS' services are needed. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of application and issuance of permit.</E> After receipt and review of the application, APHIS shall determine whether it appears that the regulated article at the time of importation will meet either the specific importation requirements in § 319.40-5 or the universal importation requirements in § 319.40-6.</P>
              <P>(1) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for importation will meet the requirements of either § 319.40-5 or § 319.40-6, a permit stating the applicable conditions for importation under this subpart shall be issued for the importation of the regulated article identified in the application.</P>
              <P>(2) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for importation will not meet the requirements of either § 319.40-5 or § 319.40-6 because these sections do not address the particular regulated article identified in the application, APHIS shall review the application by applying the plant pest risk assessment standards specified in § 319.40-11.</P>
              <P>(i) If this review reveals that importation of the regulated article under a permit and subject to the inspection and other requirements in § 319.40-9, but without any further conditions, will not result in the introduction of plant pests into the United States, a permit for importation of the regulated article shall be issued. The permit may only be issued in unique and unforeseen circumstances when the importation of the regulated article is not expected to recur.</P>
              <P>(ii) If this review reveals that the regulated article may be imported under conditions that would reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, APHIS may implement rulemaking to add the additional conditions to this subpart, and after the regulations are effective, may issue a permit for importation of the regulated article.</P>

              <P>When evaluating a request to import a regulated article not allowed importation under this subpart, or a request to import a regulated article under conditions other than those prescribed by this subpart, APHIS will conduct the following analysis to determine the plant pest risks associated with each requested importation in order to determine whether or not to issue a permit under this subpart or to propose regulations establishing conditions for the importation into the United States of the regulated article.<PRTPAGE P="263"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Collecting commodity information.</E> (1) APHIS will evaluate the application for information describing the regulated article and the origin, processing, treatment, and handling of the regulated article; and</P>
              <P>(2) APHIS will evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or introductions (including data from foreign countries) associated with the regulated article.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cataloging quarantine pests.</E> For the regulated article specified in an application, APHIS will determine what plant pests or potential plant pests are associated with the type of tree from which the regulated article was derived, in the country and locality from which the regulated article is to be exported. A plant pest that meets one of the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further evaluated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;</P>
              <P>(2) Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and capable of further dissemination in the United States;</P>
              <P>(3) Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States;</P>
              <P>(4) Native species of the United States that has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States; or</P>
              <P>(5) Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining which quarantine pests to assess.</E> (1) APHIS will divide quarantine pests identified in paragraph (b) of this section into groups depending upon where the plant pest is most likely to be found. The plant pests would be grouped as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Plant pests found on the bark;</P>
              <P>(ii) Plant pests found under the bark; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Plant pests found in the wood.</P>
              <P>(2) APHIS will subdivide each of the groups in paragraph (c)(1) of this section into associated taxa.</P>
              <P>(3) APHIS will rank the plant pests in each group in paragraph (c)(2) of this section according to plant pest risk, based on the available biological information and demonstrated plant pest importance.</P>
              <P>(4) APHIS will identify any plant pests ranked in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for which plant pest risk assessments have previously been performed in accordance with this section. APHIS will conduct individual plant pest risk assessments for the remaining plant pests, starting with the highest ranked plant pest(s) in each group.</P>
              <P>(5) The number of plant pests in each group to be evaluated through individual plant pest risk assessment will be based on biological similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures taken in connection with the importation of the regulated article to mitigate the plant pest risk associated with the regulated article. For example, if the plant pest risk assessment for the highest ranked plant pest indicates a need for a mitigation measure that would result in the same reduction of risk for other plant pests ranked in the group, the other members need not be subjected to individual plant pest risk assessment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conducting individual plant pest risk assessments.</E> APHIS will evaluate each of the plant pests identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section by:</P>
              <P>(1) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest being on, with, or in the regulated article at the time of importation;</P>
              <P>(2) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest surviving in transit on the regulated article and entering the United States undetected;</P>
              <P>(3) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest colonizing once it has entered into the United States;</P>

              <P>(4) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest spreading beyond any colonized area; and<PRTPAGE P="264"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Estimation of the damage to plants that could be expected upon introduction and dissemination within the United States of the plant pest.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Estimating unmitigated overall plant pest risk.</E> APHIS will develop an estimation of the overall plant pest risk associated with importing the regulated article based on compilation of individual plant pest risk assessments performed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Evaluating available requirements to determine whether they would allow safe importation of the regulated article.</E> The requirements of this subpart, and any other requirements relevant to the regulated article and plant pests involved, will be compared with the individual plant pest risk assessments in order to determine whether particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article would reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the imposition of particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to implement or ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will implement rulemaking to allow importation of the requested regulated article under the conditions identified by the plant pest risk assessment process.</P>

                <P>(a) The entry of the articles covered by § 319.41-1 is conditioned on their freedom from the European corn borer and other injurious insects and plant diseases, and upon their freedom from contamination with plant materials prohibited entry under other quarantines. All shipments of these articles shall be subject to inspection at the port of arrival by an inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, in order to determine their freedom from such insects and diseases and from contaminating materials, and to such sterilization, grinding, or treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, as the inspector may prescribe. Should an importation be found on inspection to be so infested or infected or contaminated that, in the judgment of the inspector, it can not be made safe by sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, the entire shipment may be refused entry.</P>
                <P>(b) When entry under sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter is permitted, the importation will be released to the permittee for such treatment, upon the filing with the appropriate customs official of a bond in the amount of $5,000, or in an amount equal to the invoice value, if such value be less than $5,000, with approved sureties, and conditioned that the importation shall be sterilized or otherwise treated under the supervision of the inspector; that no bale or container shall be broken, opened, or removed from the port of arrival unless and until a written notice is given to said customs official by an inspector that the importation has been properly sterilized or treated; and that the importation shall be redelivered to said customs official within 30 days after its arrival.</P>
                <P>(c) Should a shipment requiring sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter under the provisions of the regulation in this subpart arrive at a port where facilities for such sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter are not maintained, such shipment shall either be promptly shipped under safeguards and by routing prescribed by the inspector to an approved port where facilities for sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter are available, or it shall be refused entry.</P>
                <P>(d) Other conditions of entry as applying to the certain classes of articles enumerated in § 319.41-1 are:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Broomcorn.</E> All importations of broomcorn shall be so baled as to prevent breakage and scattering in connection with the necessary handling and sterilization; if in the judgment of the inspector they are not so baled, entry may be refused. All importations of broomcorn shall be subject to such sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter as the inspector may require.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Articles made of broomcorn.</E> Brooms or similar articles made of broomcorn shall be subject to sterilization unless their manufacture involves the substantial elimination of stems or such treatment of the included stems as in the judgment of the inspector shall preclude such articles from being the means of carriage of the European corn borer and of other injurious insects and plant diseases.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Shelled corn and other seeds.</E> If shipments of shelled corn and seeds of the other plants from countries other than those named in § 319.41-1 (b)(2) are found upon inspection at the port of arrival to be appreciably fouled with cobs or other portions of the plants the inspector may require sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter or may refuse entry.</P>

                <P>(2) That the unrestricted importation of rice straw and rice hulls may result in the entry into the United States of the injurious plant diseases heretofore enumerated, as well as insect pests.</P>
                <P>(b) To prevent the introduction into the United States of the plant pests and diseases indicated above, the Secretary has determined that it is necessary to restrict the importation of rice straw and rice hulls from all foreign locations, except as otherwise provided in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) The Administrator may authorize the importation of articles otherwise prohibited by this subpart under conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6.</P>

              <P>All fruits and vegetables that are allowed importation under this subpart must be imported in accordance with the following requirements, except as specifically provided otherwise in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Freedom from unauthorized plant parts.</E> All fruits and vegetables imported under this subpart, whether in commercial or noncommercial consignments, must be free from plant litter or debris and free of any portions of plants that are specifically prohibited in the regulations in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Permit.</E> (1) All fruits and vegetables imported under this subpart, whether commercial or noncommercial consignments, must be imported under permit issued by APHIS, must be imported under the conditions specified in the permit, and must be imported in accordance with all applicable regulations in this part; <E T="03">except</E> for:</P>

              <P>(ii) Fruits and vegetables grown in Canada (except potatoes from Newfoundland and that portion of the Municipality of Central Saanich in the Province of British Columbia east of <PRTPAGE P="272"/>the West Saanich Road, which are prohibited importation into the United States); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Fruits and vegetables, except mangoes, grown in the British Virgin Islands that are imported into the U.S. Virgin Islands.</P>
              <P>(2) Persons contemplating the importation of any fruits or vegetables under this subpart must apply for a permit in accordance with §§ 319.7 through 319.7-5.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ports of entry.</E> (1) Fruits and vegetables must be imported into specific ports if so required by this subpart or by part 305 of this chapter, or if so required by a permit issued in accordance with this section and with §§ 319.7 through 319.7-5 for the importation of the particular fruit or vegetable. If a permit issued for the importation of fruits or vegetables names specific port(s) where the fruits or vegetables must be imported, the fruits and vegetables may only be imported into the port(s) named in the permit. If a permit issued for the importation of fruits or vegetables does not name specific port(s) where the fruits or vegetables must be imported, the fruits and vegetables may be imported into any port referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Fruits and vegetables imported under this subpart may be imported into any port listed in 19 CFR 101.3(b)(1), except as otherwise provided by part 319 or by a permit issued in accordance with part 319, and except as provided in § 330.104 of this chapter.

If an inspector finds plants or portions of plants, or a plant pest or noxious weed, or evidence of a plant pest or noxious weed on or in any fruit or vegetable or its container, or finds that the fruit or vegetable may have been associated with other articles infested with plant pests or noxious weeds, the owner or agent of the owner of the fruit or vegetable must clean or treat the fruit or vegetable and its container as required by an inspector, and the fruit or vegetable is also subject to reinspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of an inspector at any time and place until all applicable requirements of this subpart have been accomplished.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Notice of arrival; assembly for inspection.</E> Any person importing fruits and vegetables into the United States must offer those agricultural products for inspection and entry at the port of first arrival. The owner or agent must assemble the fruits and vegetables for inspection at the port of first arrival, or at any other place designated by an inspector, and in a manner designated by the inspector. All fruits and vegetables must be accurately disclosed and made available to an inspector for examination. The owner or the agent must provide an inspector with the name and address of the consignee and must make full disclosure of the type, quantity, and country and locality of origin of all fruits and vegetables in the consignment, either orally for noncommercial consignments or on an invoice or similar document for commercial consignments.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Refusal of entry.</E> If an inspector finds that an imported fruit or vegetable is prohibited, or is not accompanied by required documentation, or is so infested with a plant pest or noxious weed that, in the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot or consignment may be refused entry into the United States.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Release for movement.</E> No person may move a fruit or vegetable from the port of first arrival unless an inspector has either:</P>
              <P>(i) Released it;</P>
              <P>(ii) Ordered treatment at the port of first arrival and, after treatment, released the fruit or vegetable;</P>
              <P>(iii) Authorized movement of the fruit or vegetable to another location for treatment, further inspection, or destruction; or</P>

              <P>(iv) Ordered the fruit or vegetable to be reexported.<PRTPAGE P="273"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Notice to owner of actions ordered by inspector.</E> If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, reexportation, recall, destruction, or other action with regard to imported fruits or vegetables while the consignment is in foreign commerce, the inspector will issue an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) to the owner of the fruits or vegetables or to the owner's agent. The owner must, within the time and in the manner specified in the PPQ Form 523, destroy the fruits and vegetables, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to an authorized site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the fruits and vegetables as prescribed to prevent the introduction of plant pests or noxious weeds into the United States.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Costs and charges.</E> APHIS will be responsible only for the costs of providing the services of an inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty. <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> The owner of imported fruits or vegetables is responsible for all additional costs of inspection, treatment, movement, storage, destruction, or other measures ordered by an inspector under this subpart, including any labor, chemicals, packing materials, or other supplies required. APHIS will not be responsible for any costs or charges, other than those identified in this section.</P>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">APHIS not responsible for damage.</E> APHIS assumes no responsibility for any damage to fruits or vegetables that results from the application of treatments or other measures required under this subpart (or under part 305 of this chapter) to protect against the introduction of plant pests into the United States.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination by the Administrator.</E> No fruit or vegetable is authorized importation into the United States unless the Administrator has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures designated by the Administrator and the fruit or vegetable is imported into the United States in accordance with, and as stipulated in, the permit issued by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designated phytosanitary measures.</E> (1) The fruits and vegetables are subject to phytosanitary treatments, which could include, but are not limited to, pest control treatments in the field or growing site, and post-harvest treatments.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other fruits and vegetables.</E> Fruits and vegetables not already authorized for importation as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be authorized importation only after:</P>
              <P>(i) APHIS has analyzed the pest risk posed by the importation of a fruit or vegetable from a specified foreign region and has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures;</P>

              <P>(ii) APHIS has made its pest risk analysis and determination available for public comment for at least 60 days through a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; and</P>

APHIS will also publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> advising the public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended importation requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and will invite public comment on the subject.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Administrator determines that any of the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized importation under this subpart are no longer necessary to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will make new pest risk documentation available for public comment, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, prior to allowing importation of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Pest-free areas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable. In other cases, fruits and vegetables may be imported if the area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the remaining quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application of international standard for pest free areas.</E> APHIS requires that determinations of pest-free areas be made in accordance with the criteria for establishing freedom from pests found in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 4, “Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas.” The international standard was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by reference in § 300.5 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Survey protocols.</E> APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of pest freedom.</E> (1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice or rule published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for 60 days public comment, that the area <PRTPAGE P="275"/>meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. If appropriate, APHIS would begin issuing permits for importation of the fruit or vegetable from a pest-free area because:</P>
              <P>(i) No comments were received on the notice or</P>
              <P>(ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement.</E> If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS would publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn, and that imports of host crops for the pest in question are subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, importation of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">General requirements for fruits and vegetables imported from pest-free areas.</E> (1) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> Each box of fruits or vegetables that is imported into the United States from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The name of the municipality and State in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The type and amount of fruit the box contains.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Phytosanitary certificate.</E> A phytosanitary certificate must accompany the imported fruits or vegetables, and must contain an additional declaration that the fruits originate from a pest-free area that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Safeguarding.</E> If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent export to the United States. These safeguards described in this section must be intact upon arrival in the United States.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Trust fund agreements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of fruits or vegetables and APHIS services are to be funded by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time the fruits or vegetables are exported. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined <PRTPAGE P="276"/>by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.</P>

              <P>(a) The Secretary has determined that in order to prevent the entry into the United States of khapra beetle (<E T="03">Trogoderma granarium</E> Everts) it is necessary to restrict the importation of certain articles from foreign countries and localities. Accordingly, no person shall import any regulated article unless in conformity with all of the applicable restrictions in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) Any article refused importation for noncompliance with the requirements of this subpart shall be promptly removed from the United States or abandoned by the importer, and pending such action shall be subject to the immediate application of such safeguards against escape of plant pests as the inspector determines necessary to prevent the introduction into the United States of plant pests. If the article is not promptly safeguarded, removed from the United States, or abandoned by the importer for destruction, it may be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714).</P>
              <P>(c) A regulated article may be imported without complying with other restrictions under this subpart if:</P>
              <P>(1) Imported for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes under the conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6;</P>
              <P>(2) Imported at the National Plant Germplasm Inspection Station, Building 580, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705, or through any USDA plant inspection station listed in § 319.37-8(a); and</P>
              <P>(3) Imported with a controlled import tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the article or securely attached to the article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a controlled import permit number corresponding to the number of the controlled import permit issued for such article.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection of premises.</E> Prior to issuing a permit to import restricted organisms, we will inspect the apiary or containment facility where you intend to contain the restricted organisms. In order to approve the apiary or containment facility, an inspector must determine that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent the release of diseases or parasites of bees, or of undesirable species or strains of honeybees. We will use the following criteria to determine whether adequate safeguards are in place:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Enclosed containment facilities.</E> (i) Will the facility's entryways, windows, and other structures, including water, air, and waste handling systems, contain the restricted organisms, parasites and pathogens, and prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?</P>
              <P>(ii) Does the facility have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?</P>
              <P>(iii) Does the facility have a means of inactivating or sterilizing restricted organisms and any breeding materials, pathogens, parasites, containers, or other material?</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Containment apiaries.</E> (i) Is the apiary located in an area devoid of indigenous bees and sufficiently isolated to prevent contact between indigenous bees and imported restricted organisms? Is the area extending from the apiary to the nearest indigenous bees constantly unsuitable for foraging individuals of the imported restricted organisms?</P>
              <P>(ii) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the entry of unauthorized visitors?</P>
              <P>(iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?</P>
              <P>(iv) Does the apiary have a means of inactivating or sterilizing restricted organisms, and any hives, wax, pathogens, parasites, containers, or other materials?</P>
              <P>(3) Containment apiaries for honeybees resulting from germ plasm imported from nonapproved regions.</P>
              <P>(i) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the entry of unauthorized visitors?</P>
              <P>(ii) Are there sufficient physical barriers (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, excluders) in hives in the apiary to prevent the escape of all adult queen and drone honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?</P>
              <P>(iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of all queen and drone honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?</P>
              <P>(iv) Does the apiary have a means of destroying colonies of honeybees with undesirable characteristics that may result from imported germ plasm?</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Holding in containment.</E> (1) If we issue a permit for importing restricted organisms into an approved containment facility or apiary, you may not remove or release the restricted organisms, or the progeny or germ plasm resulting from the restricted organisms, from the apiary or facility without our prior approval.</P>
              <P>(2) You must allow us to inspect the apiary or facility and all documents associated with the importation or holding of restricted organisms at any time to determine whether safeguards are being maintained to prevent the release of the restricted organisms, their progeny and germ plasm, parasites, and pathogens.</P>
              <P>(3) You must inform us immediately, but no later than 24 hours after detection, if restricted organisms escape from the facility</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Release from containment apiary or facility.</E> (1) After rearing the restricted organisms in an approved containment facility or apiary through at least 4 months of active reproduction with no evidence of nonindigenous parasites or pathogens or of undesirable characteristics, you may submit a request to us for the release of the bees. The request must include:</P>
              <P>(i) Inspection protocols;</P>

              <P>(v) Complete notes and observations on behavior, such as aggressiveness and swarming; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Any other information or data relating to bee diseases, parasites, or adverse species or subspecies.</P>
              <P>(2) Mail your request for release to the Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 133, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or fax to (301) 734-8700.</P>
              <P>(3) When we receive a complete request for release from containment, we will evaluate the request and determine whether the bees may be released. Our evaluation may include an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. We may conduct an additional inspection of the bees during our evaluation of the request. You will receive a written statement as soon as circumstances allow that approves or denies your request for release of the bees.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Inspection of foreign arrivals.</E> In order to prevent the dissemination into the United States of plant pests and for the purpose of carrying out the regulations in this part, all plant pests; means of conveyance and their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; soil; stone and quarry products under this part; garbage; and any other product or article of any character whatsoever which an inspector considers may be infested or infected by or contain a plant pest, arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof for entry into or movement through the United States shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival, except that mail will be handled in accordance with the joint customs and postal regulations for inspecting and handling mail. No such plant pests; means of conveyance or their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; soil; stone or quarry products under this part; garbage; or other products or articles which an inspector notifies the Customs authorities should be held for inspection shall be released by Customs officers for entry or onward movement until released by an inspector. The release of all means of conveyance, products and articles regulated under parts 319, 321, and 352 of this chapter shall be in accordance with the requirements of those parts and the applicable provisions in this part. Whenever it shall be deemed safe to modify the requirements of this section by exempting any class of means of conveyance, products or articles from the requirement that they be held for inspection and release of the inspector, the exemptions shall be specified in administrative instructions. Inspectors shall make local arrangements, in accordance with policies of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, with the Collector of Customs for the release by Customs officers on behalf of the inspector of any class of means of conveyance, their stores, baggage, mail, or other products or articles when such arrangements do not increase unduly the danger of plant pest dissemination and will facilitate clearance of means of conveyance, baggage, mail, or other products or articles.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection of domestic movements.</E> For the purpose of preventing the interstate movement of plant pests, provisions requiring inspection of means of conveyance and products or articles moving interstate may be issued as regulations in association with quarantines in part 301 or part 318 of this chapter or in this part.

              <SUBJECT>Emergency measures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedures to prevent pest dissemination.</E> Whenever inspection of any means of conveyance, stores, baggage, mail, plants, plant products, earth, stone and quarry products, garbage, or other products or articles of any character whatsoever, arriving in the United States from a place outside thereof, or moving interstate, discloses a plant pest, or provides a reason to believe such a pest is present (other than one moving under permit in accordance with any conditions in the permit and the provisions in this part) which is new to, or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, the inspector shall employ procedures necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pest. Such procedures shall also be employed with respect to means of conveyance or products or articles of any character whatsoever which have moved into the United States or interstate and which the inspector has reason to believe were infested or infected by or contained any such plant pest at the time of such movement. The inspector may follow administrative instructions containing procedures prescribed for certain situations, or he may follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved methods known to be effective. The procedure may involve seizure, quarantine, treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, application of other remedial measures, exportation, return to shipping point of origin, destruction, or other disposal, but no means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest owned by any person shall be destroyed, exported, or returned to shipping point of origin or ordered to be so handled, unless there is, in the opinion of the inspector, no less drastic action adequate to prevent the dissemination of the plant pest. In forming such an opinion that no less drastic action is adequate, the inspector shall be guided by applicable specific and general instructions received from officers of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. In taking action with respect to any means of conveyance, product, article, plant pest, the inspector shall take cognizance of applicable requirements of the customs and postal laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Orders for remedial measures.</E> The inspector may order the owner of any means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest, subject to disposal under paragraph (a) of this section, to treat, apply other remedial measures, destroy, or make other disposal thereof without cost to the Federal Government and in a manner specified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to apply remedial measures.</E> If the measures required by the inspector are not applied promptly by the owner within the time limits specified by the inspector, the inspector shall apply measures necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pests.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Khapra beetle infestations of means of conveyance, or cargo or stores thereof; other infestations.</E> As a means of preventing the dissemination into the United States, or interstate, of the khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts), the following procedures will be applicable when that insect is found, or there is reason to believe it is present, in a means of conveyance within paragraph (a) of this section, or in any cargo or stores in such a means of conveyance, or in any cargo or stores unloaded or landed, or being unloaded or landed, in the United States therefrom. These procedures will also apply with respect to other plant pests when the inspector finds they are necessary and sufficient to prevent the spread of such pests.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Infestation in storerooms and similar compartments of means of conveyance</E> (<E T="03">except aircraft</E>). (i) When infestation is found only in stores or storerooms, galleys, pantries, or similar noncargo compartments of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his opinion, will be effective under conditions that will not spread the infestation to other parts of the means of conveyance, or to adjacent piers or other installations. If, in the opinion of the inspector, fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the <PRTPAGE P="313"/>infested stores and portions of the means of conveyance.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the means of conveyance is to leave the territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another country within 24 hours of such order, the inspector may suspend compliance with the fumigation requirement pending departure from the United States. Pending fumigation or departure, the inspector may seal the openings of infested compartments, packages, or articles, if in his opinion the action is necessary to prevent plant pest dissemination while the means of conveyance remains in the teritorial limits of the United States, as authorized in § 330.110. The inspector may extend the 24-hour period to 48 hours, if, in his judgment, such extension is warranted by plans of the owner to remove the means of conveyance from the territorial limits of the United States within the extended period, the inability of the contractor to begin fumigation within the 24-hour period, or other reason deemed valid by the inspector. Further extension shall be given only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. Pending compliance with the requirement of fumigation, or the departure from the territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another country, no stores, laundry, furnishings or equipment, or other articles or products whether in cargo or stores, shall be unloaded from the means of conveyance except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions prescribed by him. The owner of an infested means of conveyance under notice for fumigation which leaves the territorial limits of the United States without fumigation should arrange for the eradication of the infestation before returning to the same or another port in the United States. Upon return to a port in the United States and unless the infestation has been eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the means of conveyance shall be subject to fumigation immediately upon arrival in the United States. Unloading or landing of any product or article shall not be permitted pending compliance with the fumigation requirement, except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions prescribed by him.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the means of conveyance is to remain at the port where the infestation was found or is to be moved to another port in the United States, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of the remedial measures at the port where the infestation is found, as provided in this paragraph, or he may authorize the means of conveyance to be moved to another port for fumigation or the application of other remedial measures under safeguards prescribed by him.</P>

              <P>(iv) In all instances where the inspector prescribed procedures concerned with the application of remedial measures which involve (<E T="03">a</E>) withholding permission to discharge articles or products; (<E T="03">b</E>) permission to discharge after such permission has been withheld; (<E T="03">c</E>) discontinuance of discharging; or (<E T="03">d</E>) resumption of discharging after it has been discontinued, the appropriate Customs officer shall be immediately notified in writing. The inspector shall also inform the Customs officers at the port where the infestation is found and at such other ports as may be necessary of the requirement for fumigation and/or permission to move coastwise to another U.S. port for fumigation or other remedial measures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Infestation in cargo compartments of means of conveyance</E> (<E T="03">except aircraft</E>). When infestation is found in cargo compartments or in cargo of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his opinion are necessary, with respect to the cargo and the portions of the means of conveyance which contain or contained or were contaminated by the infested cargo. If in the opinion of the inspector fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the infested portions of such means of conveyance and cargo. However, if such cargo compartments cannot be fumigated without fumigating the entire means of conveyance, the inspector may order the entire means of conveyance and cargo to be fumigated. The inspector shall notify the owner of the means of conveyance of such requirement and the owner shall arrange for immediate fumigation. Discharge of <PRTPAGE P="314"/>cargo shall be discontinued unless the inspector allows it to continue under safeguards to be prescribed by him. The provisions applicable to stores and storerooms in paragraph (d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall apply to cargo and cargo areas of such means of conveyance. Customs officers shall be informed as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Infestation in an aircraft.</E> If infestation is found in an aircraft, the inspector may apply seals as provided in § 330.110, and he may require such temporary safeguards as he deems necessary, including the discontinuance of further unloading or landing of any products or articles except as authorized by him. Upon finding such infestation in an aircraft the inspector shall promptly notify the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of all circumstances and the temporary safeguards employed, and the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs will specify the measures for eliminating the infestation which will not be deleterious to the aircraft or its operating components. Any insecticidal application required shall be approved by the Deputy Administrator for use in aircraft. If the aircraft is to depart from the territorial limits of the United States within 24 hours after the infestation is found, the inspector shall permit such departure in lieu of the application of other measures and shall prior to departure break any seals that would prevent access to the aircraft or safe operation thereof. Other seals shall remain intact at time of departure and shall be broken by the aircraft commander or a crew member upon his order only after the aircraft is beyond the territorial limits of the United States. Extension of the 24-hour period shall be given only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. The owner of the aircraft under notice of khapra beetle infestation which leaves the territorial limits of the United States before the infestation has been eradicated should arrange for eradication before returning the aircraft to the United States. Upon return to the United States, if the infestation is not eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the aircraft shall be subject to the same disinfestation requirements and other safeguards immediately upon arrival in the United States. Customs officers shall be notified as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Precautions.</E> The owner of a means of conveyance required to be fumigated pursuant to this section shall arrange with a competent operator to apply the fumigant under the supervision of the inspector. The owner shall understand that if certain fumigants are used they may result in residues in or on foodstuffs which may render them unsafe for use as food items. He is hereby warned against such use unless as ascertains that the fumigated foodstuffs are fit for human consumption. It should also be understood by the owner that emergency measures prescribed by the inspector to safeguard against dissemination of infestation may have adverse effects on certain products and articles, and that the acceptance of fumigation as a requirement is an alternative to the immediate removal of the infested means of conveyance and any products and articles thereon, from the territorial limits of the United States. Products or articles in a means of conveyance, or compartments thereof, which may be exposed to methyl bromide or other remedial measures and may be adversely affected thereby, may be removed from the means of conveyance or compartments thereof prior to the application of the remedial measures if in the opinion of the inspector this can be done without danger of plant pest dissemination and under conditions authorized by him, for additional inspection and/or application of effective remedial measures.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Use authorized; form.</E> Whenever, in the opinion of the inspector, it is necessary, as a safeguard in order to prevent the dissemination of plant pests into the United States, or interstate, seals may be applied to openings, packages, or articles requiring the security provided by such seals. The words “openings, packages, or articles” shall include any form of container, shelf, bin, compartment, or other opening, package, or article which the inspector may have occasion to seal in lieu of more drastic action or otherwise, as a safeguard against plant pest dissemination. The seals may be automatic metal seals or labels or tags and will be provided by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. When they consist of a label or tag, they will be printed in black ink on yellow paper and read substantially as follows: “Warning! The opening, package, or article to which this seal is affixed is sealed under authority of law. This seal is not to be broken while within the territorial limits of the United States except by, or under instructions of, an inspector.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Breaking of seals.</E> Seals may be broken: (1) By an inspector; (2) by a Customs officer for Customs purposes, in which case the opening, package, or article will be resealed with Customs seals; (3) by the owner or his agent when the means of conveyance, product, or article has left the territorial limits of the United States; (4) by any person authorized by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator under conditions specified by the inspector or Deputy Administrator. No person shall break seals applied under authority of this section except as provided in this paragraph. The movement into or through the United States, or interstate, of any means of conveyance or product or article on which a seal, applied under this paragraph, has been broken in violation of this paragraph is hereby prohibited, except as authorized by an inspector.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of sealing.</E> When an inspector seals any opening, product or article, he shall explain the purpose of such action to the owner or his representative and shall present him with a written notice of the conditions under which the seal may be broken, if requested to do so.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Issuance of a permit.</E> APHIS may issue a permit to an applicant if APHIS concludes that the actions indicated in the permit application are not likely to introduce or disseminate a plant pest, biological control organism, or noxious weed within the United States in a manner that exposes plants and plant products to unacceptable risk. Issuance will occur as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) Prior to issuing the permit, APHIS will notify the applicant in writing or electronically of all proposed permit conditions. The applicant must agree in writing or electronically that he or she, and all his or her employees, agents, and/or officers, will comply with all permit conditions and all provisions of this subpart. If the organism or associated article will be contained in a private residence, the applicant must state in this agreement <PRTPAGE P="319"/>that he or she authorizes APHIS to conduct unscheduled assessments of the residence during normal business hours if a permit is issued.</P>
              <P>(ii) APHIS will issue the permit after it receives and reviews the applicant's agreement. The permit will be valid for no more than 3 years. During that period, the permittee must abide by all permitting conditions, and the use of the organism or associated article must conform to the intended use on the permit. Moreover, the use of organisms derived from a regulated parent organism during that period must conform to the intended use specified on the permit for the parent organism.</P>
              <P>(iii) All activities carried out under the permit must cease on or before the expiration date for the permit, unless, prior to that expiration date, the permittee has submitted a new permit application and a new permit has been issued to authorize continuation of those actions.</P>
              <P>(iv) At any point following issuance of a permit but prior to its expiration date, an inspector may conduct unscheduled assessments of the site or facility in which the organisms or associated articles are held, to determine whether they are constructed and are being maintained in a manner that prevents the dissemination of organisms or associated articles from the site or facility. The permittee must allow all such assessments requested by APHIS during normal business hours. Failure to allow such assessments constitutes grounds for revocation of the permit.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Denial of a permit application.</E> APHIS may deny an application for a permit if:</P>
              <P>(i) APHIS concludes that the actions proposed in the permit application would present an unacceptable risk to plants and plant products because of the introduction or dissemination of a plant pest, biological control organism, or noxious weed within the United States; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The actions proposed in the permit application would be adverse to the conduct of an APHIS eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A State or Tribal executive official, or a State or Tribal plant protection official authorized to do so, objects to the movement in writing and provides specific, detailed information that there is a risk the movement will result in the dissemination of a plant pest or noxious weed into the State, APHIS evaluates the information and agrees, and APHIS determines that such plant pest or noxious weed risk cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The applicant does not agree to observe all of the proposed permit conditions that APHIS has determined are necessary to mitigate identified risks; or</P>
              <P>(v) The applicant does not provide information requested by APHIS as part of an assessment of sites or facilities, or does not allow APHIS to inspect sites or facilities associated with the actions listed on the permit application; or</P>
              <P>(vi) APHIS determines that the applicant has not followed prior permit conditions, or has not adequately demonstrated that they can meet the requirements for the current application. Factors that may contribute to such a determination include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) The applicant, or a partnership, firm, corporation, or other legal entity in which the applicant has a substantial interest, financial or otherwise, has not complied with any permit that was previously issued by APHIS.</P>
              <P>(B) Issuing the permit would circumvent any order denying or revoking a previous permit issued by APHIS.</P>
              <P>(C) The applicant has previously failed to comply with any APHIS regulation.</P>
              <P>(D) The applicant has previously failed to comply with any other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or instructions pertaining to plant health.</P>
              <P>(E) The applicant has previously failed to comply with the laws or regulations of a national plant protection organization or equivalent body, as these pertain to plant health.</P>
              <P>(F) APHIS has determined that the applicant has made false or fraudulent statements or provided false or fraudulent records to APHIS.</P>
              <P>(G) The applicant has been convicted or has pled <E T="03">nolo contendere</E> to any crime involving fraud, bribery, extortion, or <PRTPAGE P="320"/>any other crime involving a lack of integrity.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Withdrawal of a permit application.</E> Any permit application may be withdrawn at the request of the applicant. If the applicant wishes to withdraw a permit application, he or she must provide the request in writing to APHIS. APHIS will provide written notification to the applicant as promptly as circumstances allow regarding reception of the request and withdrawal of the application.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Cancellation of a permit.</E> Any permit that has been issued may be canceled at the request of the permittee. If a permittee wishes a permit to be canceled, he or she must provide the request in writing to APHIS-PPQ. Whenever a permit is canceled, APHIS will notify the permittee in writing regarding such cancellation.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Revocation of a permit.</E> APHIS may revoke a permit for any of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(i) After issuing the permit, APHIS obtains information that would have otherwise provided grounds for it to deny the permit application; or</P>
              <P>(ii) APHIS determines that the actions undertaken under the permit have resulted in or are likely to result in the introduction into or dissemination within the United States of a plant pest or noxious weed in a manner that presents an unacceptable risk to plants or plant products; or</P>
              <P>(iii) APHIS determines that the permittee, or any employee, agent, or officer of the permittee, has failed to comply with a provision of the permit or the regulations under which the permit was issued.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Amendment of permits</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amendment at permittee's request.</E> If a permittee determines that circumstances have changed since the permit was initially issued and wishes the permit to be amended accordingly, he or she must request the amendment, either through APHIS' online portal for permit applications, or by contacting APHIS directly via phone or email. The permittee may have to provide supporting information justifying the amendment. APHIS will review the amendment request, and may amend the permit if only minor changes are necessary. Requests for more substantive changes may require a new permit application. Prior to issuance of an amended permit, the permittee may be required to agree in writing that he or she, and his or her employees, agents, and/or officers will comply with the amended permit and conditions.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amendment initiated by APHIS.</E> APHIS may amend any permit and its conditions at any time, upon determining that the amendment is needed to address newly identified considerations concerning the risks presented by the organism or the activities being conducted under the permit. APHIS may also amend a permit at any time to ensure that the permit conditions are consistent with all of the requirements of this part. As soon as circumstances allow, APHIS will notify the permittee of the amendment to the permit and the reason(s) for it. Depending on the nature of the amendment, the permittee may have to agree in writing or electronically that he or she, and his or her employees, agents, and/or officers, will comply with the permit and conditions as amended before APHIS will issue the amended permit. If APHIS requests such an agreement, and the permittee does not agree in writing that he or she, and his or her employees, agents, and/or officers, will comply with the amended permit and conditions, the existing permit will be revoked.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Suspension of permitted actions.</E> APHIS may suspend authorization of actions authorized under a permit if it identifies new factors that cause it to reevaluate the risk associated with those actions. APHIS will notify the permittee in writing of this suspension explaining the reasons for it and stating the actions for which APHIS is suspending authorization. Depending on the results of APHIS' evaluation, APHIS will subsequently contact the permittee to remove the suspension, amend the permit, or revoke the permit.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> Any person whose application has been denied, whose permit has been revoked or amended, or whose authorization for actions authorized under a permit has been suspended, may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 business <PRTPAGE P="321"/>days after receiving the written notification of the denial, revocation, amendment, or suspension. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the application was wrongfully denied, permit revoked or amended, or authorization for actions under a permit suspended. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow.</P>

              <P>(1) Evidence indicating that the organism is indigenous to the continental United States throughout its geographical or ecological range, or evidence indicating that the organism has produced self-replicating populations within the continental United States for an amount of time sufficient, based on the organism's taxon, to consider that taxon established throughout its geographical or ecological range in the continental United States; or</P>
              <P>(2) Evidence that the organism's geographical or ecological range includes an extremely limited area of or none of the continental United States based on its inability to maintain year to year self-replicating populations despite repeated introductions over a sufficient range of time; or</P>
              <P>(3) The petition would include evidence that the organism cannot establish anywhere in the continental United States; or</P>

              <P>(4) Results from a field study where data were collected from representative habitats occupied by the biological control organism. Studies must include sampling for any direct or indirect impacts on target and non-target hosts of <PRTPAGE P="322"/>the biological control organism in these habitats. Supporting scientific literature must be cited; or</P>
              <P>(5) Any other data, including published scientific reports, that suggest that subsequent releases of the organism into the environment of the continental United States will present no additional plant pest risk (direct or indirect) to plants or plant products.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">APHIS review of petitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evaluation.</E> APHIS will review the petition to determine whether it is complete. If APHIS determines that the petition is complete, it will conduct an evaluation of the petition to determine whether there is sufficient evidence that the organism exists throughout its geographical or ecological range in the continental United States and that subsequent releases of pure cultures of field populations of the organism into the environment of the continental United States will present no additional plant pest risk (direct or indirect) to plants or plant products.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of availability of the petition.</E> If APHIS determines that there is sufficient evidence that the organism exists throughout its geographical or ecological range in the continental United States and that subsequent releases of pure cultures of the organism into the environment of the continental United States will present no additional plant pest risk to plants or plant products, APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing the availability of the petition and requesting public comment on that document.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of determination.</E> (i) If no comments are received, or if the comments received do not lead APHIS to reconsider its determination, APHIS will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a subsequent notice describing the comments received and stating that the organism has been added to the list referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the comments received lead APHIS to reconsider its determination, APHIS will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a subsequent notice describing the comments received and stating its reasons for determining not to add the organism to the list referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Removal of organisms from the list of exempt organisms.</E> Any biological control organism may be removed from the list referred to in paragraph (b) of this section if information emerges that would have otherwise led APHIS to deny the petition to add the organism to the list. Whenever an organism is removed from the list, APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing that action and the basis for it.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exceptions to permitting requirements for the importation or interstate movement of certain plant pests.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Pursuant to section 7711 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Administrator has determined that certain plant pests may be moved interstate within the continental United States without restriction. The list of all such plant pests is on the PPQ Permits and Certifications website at <E T="03">https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/permits.</E> Plant pests listed as being excepted from permitting requirements, unless otherwise indicated, may be moved interstate within the continental United States without further restriction under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Categories.</E> In order to be included on the list, a plant pest must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be from field populations or lab cultures derived from field populations of a taxon that is established throughout its entire geographical or ecological range within the continental United States; or</P>
              <P>(2) Be commercially available and raised under the regulatory purview of other Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Petition process to add plant pests to the list</E>—(1) <E T="03">Petition.</E> Any person may petition APHIS to have an additional plant pest added to the list of plant pests that may be imported into or moved in interstate commerce within the continental United States without restriction. To submit a petition, the person must provide, in writing, information supporting the placement of a particular pest in one of the categories listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Information that the plant pest belongs to a taxon that is established throughout its entire geographical or ecological range within the United States must include scientific literature, unpublished studies, or data regarding:</P>
              <P>(A) The biology of the plant pest, including characteristics that allow it to be identified, known hosts, and virulence;</P>
              <P>(B) The geographical or ecological range of the plant pest within the continental United States; and</P>
              <P>(C) The areas of the continental United States within which the plant pest is established.</P>
              <P>(ii) Information that the plant pest is commercially available and raised under the regulatory purview of another Federal agency must include a citation to the relevant law, regulation, or order under which the agency exercises such oversight.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">APHIS review.</E> APHIS will review the information contained in the petition to determine whether it is complete. In order to consider the petition complete, APHIS may require additional information to determine whether the plant pest belongs to one of the categories listed in paragraph (a) of this section. When it is determined that the information is complete, APHIS will commence review of the petition.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Action on petitions to add pests.</E> (i) If, after review of the petition, APHIS determines there is insufficient evidence that the plant pest belongs to one of the categories listed in paragraph (a) of this section, APHIS will deny the petition, and notify the petitioner in writing regarding this denial.</P>

              <P>(ii) If, after review of the petition, APHIS determines that the plant pest belongs to one of the categories in paragraph (a) of this section, APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that announces the availability of the petition and any supporting documentation to the public, that states that APHIS intends to add the plant pest to the list of plant pests that may be imported into or moved in interstate commerce within the continental United States without restriction, and that requests public comment. If no comments are received on the notice, or if, based on the comments received, APHIS determines that its conclusions regarding the petition have not been affected, APHIS will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a subsequent notice stating that the plant pest has been added to the list.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Petition process to have plant pests removed from the list</E>—(1) <E T="03">Petition.</E> Any <PRTPAGE P="325"/>person may petition to have a plant pest removed from the list of plant pests that may be imported into or moved interstate within the continental United States without restriction by writing to APHIS. The petition must contain independently verifiable information demonstrating that APHIS' initial determination that the plant pest belongs to one of the categories in paragraph (a) of the section should be changed, or that additional information is now available that would have caused us to change the initial decision.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">APHIS review.</E> APHIS will review the information contained in the petition to determine whether it is complete. In order to consider the petition complete, APHIS may require additional information supporting the petitioner's claim. When it is determined that the information is complete, APHIS will commence review of the petition.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">APHIS action on petitions to remove pests.</E> (i) If, after review of the petition, APHIS determines that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that its initial determination should be changed, APHIS will deny the petition, and notify the petitioner in writing regarding this denial.</P>

              <P>(ii) If, after review of the petition, APHIS determines that there is a sufficient basis to suggest that its initial determination should be changed, APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that announces the availability of the petition, and that requests public comment regarding removing the plant pest from the list of plant pests that may be imported into or move in interstate commerce within the continental United States without restriction. If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments received do not affect APHIS' conclusions regarding the petition, APHIS will publish a subsequent notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> stating that the plant pest has been removed from the list.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">APHIS-initiated changes to the list.</E> (1) APHIS may propose to add a plant pest to or remove a pest from the list of plant pests that may be imported into or move in interstate commerce within the continental United States without restriction, if it determines that there is sufficient evidence that the plant pest belongs to one of the categories listed in paragraph (a) of the section, or if evidence emerges that leads APHIS to reconsider its initial determination that the plant pest was or was not in one of the categories listed in paragraph (a) of this section. APHIS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing this proposed addition or removal, making available any supporting documentation that it prepares, and requesting public comment.</P>

              <P>(2) If no comments are received on the notice or if the comments received do not affect the conclusions of the notice, APHIS will publish a subsequent notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> stating that the plant pest has been added to or removed from the list.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Garbage generated onboard a conveyance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to garbage generated onboard any means of conveyance during international or interstate movements as provided in this section and includes food scraps, table refuse, galley refuse, food wrappers or packaging materials, and other waste material from stores, food preparation areas, passengers' or crews' quarters, dining rooms, or any other areas on the means of conveyance. This section also applies to meals and other food that were available for consumption by passengers and crew on an aircraft but were not consumed.</P>

              <P>(1) Not all garbage generated onboard a means of conveyance is regulated for <PRTPAGE P="328"/>the purposes of this section. Garbage regulated for the purposes of this section is defined as “regulated garbage” in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Garbage that is commingled with regulated garbage is also regulated garbage.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Garbage regulated because of movements outside the United States or Canada.</E> For purposes of this section, garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if, when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has been in any port outside the United States and Canada within the previous 2-year period. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These exceptions are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exception 1: Aircraft.</E> Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the aircraft:</P>
              <P>(i) The aircraft had previously been cleared of all garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of origin, except meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk and cream from countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which foot-and-mouth disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the items previously cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section were removed, the aircraft has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception 2: Other conveyances.</E> Garbage on or removed in the United States from a means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:</P>
              <P>(i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an inspector stating the following:</P>
              <P>(A) That the means of conveyance had previously been cleared of all garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of origin, except meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk and cream from countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which foot-and-mouth disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the items previously cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) That the means of conveyance had then been cleaned and disinfected in the presence of the inspector; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Since being cleaned and disinfected, the means of conveyance has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Garbage regulated because of certain movements to or from Hawaii, territories, or possessions.</E> For purposes of this section, garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if at the time the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has moved during the previous 1-year period, either directly or indirectly, to the continental United States from any territory or possession or from Hawaii, to any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii, or to Hawaii from any territory or possession. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These exceptions are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exception 1: Aircraft.</E> Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the aircraft:</P>
              <P>(i) The aircraft had been previously cleared of all garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables, and the items previously cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section were removed, the aircraft has <PRTPAGE P="329"/>not moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or possession.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception 2: Other conveyances.</E> Garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:</P>
              <P>(i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an inspector stating that the means of conveyance had been cleared of all garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables; and the items previously cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) After being cleared of the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the means of conveyance has not moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or possession.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Restrictions on regulated garbage.</E> (1) Regulated garbage may not be disposed of, placed on, or removed from a means of conveyance except in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Regulated garbage is subject to general surveillance for compliance with this section by inspectors and to disposal measures authorized by the Plant Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection Act to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests and diseases of plants and livestock.</P>

              <P>(3) All regulated garbage must be contained in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles during storage on board a means of conveyance while in the territorial waters, or while otherwise within the territory of the United States. All such receptacles shall be contained inside the guard rail if on a watercraft. Such regulated garbage shall not be unloaded from such means of conveyance in the United States unless such regulated garbage is removed in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles under the direction of an inspector to an approved facility for incineration, sterilization, or grinding into an approved sewage system, under direct supervision by such an inspector, or such regulated garbage is removed for other handling in such manner and under such supervision as may, upon request in specific cases, be approved by the Administrator as adequate to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests and animal diseases and sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable laws for environmental protection. <E T="03">Provided that</E>, a cruise ship may dispose of regulated garbage in landfills at Alaskan ports only, if and only if the cruise ship does not have prohibited or restricted meat or animal products on board at the time it enters Alaskan waters for the cruise season, and only if the cruise ship, except for incidental travel through international waters necessary to navigate safely between ports, remains in Canadian and U.S. waters off the west coast of North America, and calls only at continental U.S. and Canadian ports during the entire cruise season.</P>
              <P>(i) Application for approval of a facility or sewage system may be made in writing by the authorized representative of any carrier or by the official having jurisdiction over the port or place of arrival of the means of conveyance to the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. The application must be endorsed by the operator of the facility or sewage system.</P>

              <P>(ii) Approval will be granted if the Administrator determines that the requirements set forth in this section are met. Approval may be denied or withdrawn at any time, if the Administrator determines that such requirements are not met, after notice of the proposed denial or withdrawal of the approval and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with such requirements, has been afforded to the operator of the facility or sewage system <PRTPAGE P="330"/>and to the applicant for approval. However, approval may also be withdrawn without such prior procedure in any case in which the public health, interest, or safety requires immediate action, and in such case, the operator of the facility or sewage system and the applicant for approval shall promptly thereafter be given notice of the withdrawal and the reasons therefor and an opportunity to show cause why the approval should be reinstated.</P>
              <P>(e) The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and Veterinary Services, Animal, and Plant Health Inspection Service, will cooperate with other Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for enforcing other statutes and regulations governing disposal of the regulated garbage to the end that such disposal shall be adequate to prevent the dissemination of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases and comply with applicable laws for environmental protection. The inspectors, in maintaining surveillance over regulated garbage movements and disposal, shall coordinate their activities with the activities of representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal, State, and local agencies also having jurisdiction over such regulated garbage</P>

              <SUBJECT>Garbage generated in Hawaii.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to garbage generated in households, commercial establishments, institutions, and businesses prior to interstate movement from Hawaii, and includes used paper, discarded cans and bottles, and food scraps. Such garbage includes, and is commonly known as, municipal solid waste.</P>
              <P>(1) Industrial process wastes, mining wastes, sewage sludge, incinerator ash, or other wastes from Hawaii that the Administrator determines do not pose risks of introducing animal or plant pests or diseases into the continental United States are not regulated under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The interstate movement from Hawaii to the continental United States of agricultural wastes and yard waste (other than incidental amounts (less than 3 percent) that may be present in municipal solid waste despite reasonable efforts to maintain source separation) is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(3) Garbage generated onboard any means of conveyance during interstate movement from Hawaii is regulated under § 330.401.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Restrictions on interstate movement of garbage.</E> The interstate movement of garbage generated in Hawaii to the continental United States is regulated as provided in this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The garbage must be processed, packaged, safeguarded, and disposed of using a methodology that the Administrator has determined is adequate to prevent the introduction or dissemination of plant pests into noninfested areas of the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) The garbage must be moved under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 330.403. APHIS will only enter into a compliance agreement when the Administrator is satisfied that the Agency has first satisfied all its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act and all applicable Federal and State statutes to fully assess the impacts associated with the movement of garbage under the compliance agreement.</P>
              <P>(3) All such garbage moved interstate from Hawaii to any of the continental United States must be moved in compliance with all applicable laws for environmental protection.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 330.403</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Compliance agreement and cancellation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any person engaged in the business of handling or disposing of garbage in accordance with this subpart must first enter into a compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Compliance agreement forms (PPQ Form 519) are available without charge from local USDA/APHIS/Plant Protection and Quarantine offices, which are listed in telephone directories.</P>

              <P>(b) A person who enters into a compliance agreement, and employees or agents of that person, must comply with the following conditions and any supplemental conditions which are listed in the compliance agreement, as deemed by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the dissemination into or within the United States of <PRTPAGE P="331"/>plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases:</P>
              <P>(1) Comply with all applicable provisions of this subpart;</P>
              <P>(2) Allow inspectors access to all records maintained by the person regarding handling or disposal of garbage, and to all areas where handling or disposal of garbage occurs;</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If the garbage is regulated under § 330.401, remove garbage from a means of conveyance only in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the garbage is regulated under § 330.402, transport garbage interstate in packaging approved by the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(4) Move the garbage only to a facility approved by the Administrator; and</P>
              <P>(5) At the approved facility, dispose of the garbage in a manner approved by the Administrator and described in the compliance agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) Approval for a compliance agreement may be denied at any time if the Administrator determines that the applicant has not met or is unable to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart. Prior to denying any application for a compliance agreement, APHIS will provide notice to the applicant thereof, and will provide the applicant with an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with requirements.</P>
              <P>(d) Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the person who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. This administrative remedy must be exhausted before a person can file suit in court challenging the cancellation of a compliance agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) Where a compliance agreement is denied or canceled, the person who entered into or applied for the compliance agreement may be prohibited, at the discretion of the Administrator, from handling or disposing of regulated garbage.</P>

                <SU>1</SU> Part 340 regulates, among other things, the introduction of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests or are believed to be plant pests. The introduction into the United States of such articles also may be subject to other regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701-7772) and found in 7 CFR parts 319, 330, and 360. For example, under regulations promulgated in “Subpart H—Plants for Planting” (7 CFR 319.37-5 of this chapter), a permit is required for the importation of certain classes of plants for planting whether such plants are genetically engineered or not. Accordingly, individuals should refer to those regulations before importing any plants for planting.</P>

                <SU>5</SU> APHIS may issue guidelines regarding scientific procedures, practices, or protocols which it has found acceptable in making various determinations under the regulations. A person may follow an APHIS guideline or follow different procedures, practices, or protocols. When different procedures, practices, or protocols are followed, a person may, but is not required to, discuss the matter in advance with APHIS to help ensure that the procedures, practices, or protocols to be followed will be acceptable to APHIS.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Certain regulated articles may be introduced without a permit, provided that the introduction is in compliance with the requirements of this section. Any other introduction of regulated articles require a permit under § 340.4, with the exception of introductions that are conditionally exempt from permit requirements under § 340.2(b) of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Regulated articles eligible for introduction under the notification procedure.</E> Regulated articles which meet all of the following six requirements and the <PRTPAGE P="353"/>performance standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for introduction under the notification procedure.</P>
            <P>(1) The regulated article is any plant species that is not listed as a noxious weed in regulations at 7 CFR part 360 under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7712), and, when being considered for release into the environment, the regulated article is not considered by the Administrator to be a weed in the area of release into the environment.</P>
            <P>(2) The introduced genetic material is “stably integrated” in the plant genome, as defined in § 340.1.</P>
            <P>(3) The function of the introduced genetic material is known and its expression in the regulated article does not result in plant disease.</P>
            <P>(4) The introduced genetic material does not:</P>
            <P>(i) Cause the production of an infectious entity, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Encode substances that are known or likely to be toxic to nontarget organisms known or likely to feed or live on the plant species, or</P>
            <P>(iii) Encode products intended for pharmaceutical or industrial use.</P>
            <P>(5) To ensure that the introduced genetic sequences do not pose a significant risk of the creation of any new plant virus, plant virus-derived sequences must be:</P>
            <P>(i) Noncoding regulatory sequences of known function, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Sense or antisense genetic constructs derived from viral genes from plant viruses that are prevalent and endemic in the area where the introduction will occur and that infect plants of the same host species, and that do not encode a functional noncapsid gene product responsible for cell-to-cell movement of the virus.</P>
            <P>(6) The plant has not been modified to contain the following genetic material from animal or human pathogens:</P>
            <P>(i) Any nucleic acid sequence derived from an animal or human virus, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Coding sequences whose products are known or likely causal agents of disease in animals or humans.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Performance standards for introductions under the notification procedure.</E> The following performance standards must be met for any introductions under the notification procedure.</P>
            <P>(1) If the plants or plant materials are shipped, they must be shipped in such a way that the viable plant material is unlikely to be disseminated while in transit and must be maintained at the destination facility in such a way that there is no release into the environment.</P>
            <P>(2) When the introduction is an environmental release, the regulated article must be planted in such a way that they are not inadvertently mixed with non-regulated plant materials of any species which are not part of the environmental release.</P>
            <P>(3) The plants and plant parts must be maintained in such a way that the identity of all material is known while it is in use, and the plant parts must be contained or devitalized when no longer in use.</P>
            <P>(4) There must be no viable vector agent associated with the regulated article.</P>
            <P>(5) The field trial must be conducted such that:</P>
            <P>(i) The regulated article will not persist in the environment, and</P>
            <P>(ii) No offspring can be produced that could persist in the environment.</P>
            <P>(6) Upon termination of the field test:</P>
            <P>(i) No viable material shall remain which is likely to volunteer in subsequent seasons, or</P>

Insects (any life stage) shall be placed in an escape-proof primary shipping container (insulated vacuum container, glass, metal, plastic, etc.) and sealed to prevent escape. Such primary container shall be placed securely within a secondary shipping container of crushproof styrofoam or other material of equivalent strength; one or more rigid ice packs may also be placed within the secondary shipping container; and sufficient packing material shall be added around the primary container to prevent movement of the primary shipping container. The secondary (styrofoam or other) container shall be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Other macroscopic organisms.</E> Other macroscopic organisms not covered in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (4) of this section which do not require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be packaged as specified in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section. All macroscopic organisms which are not plants and which require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be placed in primary shipping containers constructed of a sturdy, crush-proof frame of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material, surrounded by escape-proof mesh or netting of a strength and mesh size sufficient to prevent the escape of the smallest organism in the shipment, with edges and seams of the mesh or netting sealed to prevent escape of organisms. Each primary shipping container shall be securely placed within a larger secondary shipping container constructed of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material. The primary and secondary shipping containers shall then be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength, which outer container may have air holes or spaces in the sides and/or ends of the container, provided that the outer shipping container must retain sufficient strength to prevent crushing of the primary and secondary shipping containers.</P>

The permit may consist of a general authorization as set out in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section or § 352.11, or it may be a specific permit. A specific permit may be formal or oral except as a formal permit is required by paragraph (c) or (e) of this section. The Deputy Administrator may in administrative instructions require specific or formal permits for any class of products or articles subject to this part.</P>
            <P>(2) A formal permit may be issued in prescribed form, in letter form, or a combination thereof.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles brought in for temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is not intended.</E> No permit other than the authorization contained in this paragraph shall be required for bringing into the United States any plants, plant products, plant pests, biological control organisms, noxious weeds, or soil subject to this part for temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is not intended, e.g., in connection with residue cargo movement under Customs procedure, or in connection with Customs entry for exportation or for transportation and exportation. This authorization also includes transshipment of products and articles under this paragraph from a carrier directly to another carrier of the same company when necessitated by an emergency or operating requirement and effected in accordance with safeguards prescribed in writing or orally by the inspector under § 352.10.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles unloaded or landed for immediate transshipment and exportation, or immediate transportation and exportation.</E> When in the opinion of the inspector it is unnecessary to specify in a formal permit the safeguards required to prevent plant pest dissemination, plants, plant products, plant pests, biological control organisms, noxious weeds, or soil subject to this part may be unloaded or landed for immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate transportation and exportation, as provided in § 352.10, with the approval of the inspector and no further permit than the authorization contained in this paragraph; otherwise a formal permit shall be required for such unloading or landing.</P>

Such restricted products and articles shall become subject to the applicable permit and other requirements of parts 319, 330, and 360 of this chapter upon arrival at the port where Customs entry is to be made and shall not be unloaded or landed unless they comply with the applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Formal permits required for certain prohibited or restricted products or articles brought into a foreign trade zone.</E> A formal permit must be obtained to bring any prohibited or restricted plants, plant products, plant pests, biological control organisms, noxious weeds, or soil subject to the provisions in this part, into a foreign trade zone for storage, manipulation, or other handling, except for immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate transportation and exportation. Special conditions to safeguard such storage, manipulation, or other possession or handling may be specified in the permit, and when so specified shall be in addition to any other applicable requirements of this part or the safeguards prescribed by the inspector or otherwise under this part.</P>

In the case of prohibited or restricted products or articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or for onward movement to the port of entry as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, this shall include necessary safeguards with respect to any movement within the port area between the point of arrival and the point of temporary storage, other handling, or point of departure, including a foreign trade zone. Prohibited and restricted products and articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or for onward movement as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, shall be transshipped, or transported and exported from the United States, or moved onward immediately. This shall mean the shortest practicable interval of time commensurate with the risk of plant pest, noxious weed, or biological control organism disseminatio required to transfer the products or articles from one carrier to another and to move them onward or from the United States. If, in the opinion of the inspector, considerations of risk of plant pest or noxious weed dissemination require, such movement shall be made without regard to the noncompetitive or competitive relations of the carriers concerned, and the inspector shall promptly report to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the circumstances when the emergency is so acute that subsequent movement is required on a carrier of a company other than the one bringing the products or articles to the United States or on which onward movement was contemplated by the shipper or forwarding carrier. Prohibited or restricted plants, plant products, plant pests, biological control organisms, and soil which were intended for entry into the United States under parts 319, 330, or 360 of this chapter, or for movement into or through the United States under this part, and which were refused such entry or movement before unloading or landing, or which were refused such entry or movement after unloading or landing and are immediately reloaded on the same carrier, may be retained on board pending removal from the United States or other disposal, but shall be subject to the safeguards specified under this section. Prohibited or restricted products and articles which were refused entry or movement under said parts after unloading or landing and which are not immediately reloaded in accordance with this section shall be subject to such safeguard action as the inspector deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this part.</P>

            <P>(2) Safeguards prescribed by an inspector under this section shall be prescribed to the owner by the inspector in writing except that the inspector may prescribe the safeguards orally when, in his opinion, the circumstances <PRTPAGE P="374"/>and related Customs procedures do not require written notice to the owner of the safeguards to be followed by the owner. In prescribing safeguards, the relevant requirements of parts 319, 330, or 360 of this chapter and this part shall be considered. The safeguards prescribed shall be the minimum required to preventplant pest, noxious weed, or biological control organism dissemination. Destruction or exportation shall be required only when no less drastic measures are deemed by the inspector to be adequate to prevent plant pest, noxious weed, or biological control organism dissemination . The inspector may follow administrative instructions promulgated for certain situations, or he may follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved methods known to be effective in similar situations. In the case of aircraft that are contaminated with insect pests, only an insecticidal formulation, approved for use in aircraft, may be so applied as an emergency measure. If the application is not effective against the insect pests or if other pests must be safeguarded against, the inspector shall report the circumstances promptly to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and receive instructions as to safeguards that will not have a deleterious effect on the structure of the aircraft or its operating equipment. In prescribing safeguards consideration will be given to such factors as:</P>
            <P>(i) The nature and habits of the plant pests or biological control organisms known to be, or likely to be, present with the plants, plant products, soil, or other products or articles.</P>

            <P>(iii) Nature of containers or other packaging and adequacy thereof to preventplant pest, noxious weed, or biological control organism dissemination.</P>
            <P>(iv) Climatic conditions as they may have a bearing on plant pest or biological control organism dispersal, and refrigeration if provided.</P>
            <P>(v) Routing pending exportation.</P>
            <P>(vi) Presence of soil.</P>
            <P>(vii) Construction or physical condition and type of carrier.</P>

            <P>The export certification program does not require certification of any exports, but does provide certification of plants and plant products as a service to exporters. After assessing the phytosanitary condition of the plants or plant products intended for export, relative to the receiving country's regulations, an inspector issues an internationally recognized phytosanitary certificate, a phytosanitary certificate for reexport, or an export certificate for processed plant products if warranted. APHIS also enters into written agreements with industry to allow the issuance of industry-issued certificates giving assurance that a plant product has been handled, processed, or inspected in a manner required by a foreign government. An industry-issued certificate includes an ISPM 15 quality/treatment mark.</P>

              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> A list of accredited non-government facilities may be obtained by writing to Phytosanitary Issues Management, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road, Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(1) A non-government facility's compliance with the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section shall be determined through an assessment of the facility and its fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks to be accredited. If, after evaluating the results of the assessment, the Administrator determines that the facility meets the accreditation criteria, the facility's application for accreditation will be approved.</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator may deny accreditation to, or withdraw the accreditation of, any non-government facility to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services upon a determination that the facility does not meet the criteria for accreditation or maintenance of accreditation under paragraph (b) of this section and has failed to take the remedial action recommended to correct identified deficiencies.</P>

            <P>(i) In the case of a denial, the operator of the facility will be informed of <PRTPAGE P="385"/>the reasons for the denial and may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving notification of the denial. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the facility was wrongfully denied accreditation. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of withdrawal, before such action is taken, the operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The operator of the facility may appeal the proposed withdrawal in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after being informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the reasons for the proposed withdrawal are incorrect or do not support the withdrawal of the accreditation of the facility. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. However, withdrawal shall become effective pending final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator determines that such action is necessary to protect the public health, interest, or safety. Such withdrawal will be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator of the facility. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will be given as promptly as circumstances allow. This withdrawal will continue in effect pending the completion of the proceeding, and any judicial review thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(3) The Administrator will withdraw the accreditation of a non-government facility if the operator of the facility informs APHIS in writing that the facility wishes to terminate its accredited status.</P>
            <P>(4) A non-government facility whose accreditation has been denied or withdrawn may reapply for accreditation using the application procedures in paragraph (b) of this section. If the facility's accreditation was denied or withdrawn under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the facility operator must include with the application written documentation specifying what actions have been taken to correct the conditions that led to the denial or withdrawal of accreditation.</P>
            <P>(5) All information gathered during the course of a non-government facility's assessment and during the term of its accreditation will be treated by APHIS with the appropriate level of confidentiality, as set forth in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's administrative regulations in § 1.11 of this title.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for accreditation of non-government facilities.</E> (1) Specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection are set forth in this part and may be obtained by writing to APHIS. If specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection have not been promulgated by APHIS, and the Administrator determines that accreditation in that area is practical, APHIS will develop appropriate standards applicable to accreditation in the area for which the non-government facility is seeking accreditation and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to inform the public and other interested persons of the opportunity to comment on and participate in the development of those standards.</P>
            <P>(2) The operator of a non-government facility seeking accreditation to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection shall submit an application to the Administrator. The application must be completed and signed by the operator of the facility or his or her authorized representative and must contain the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Legal name and full address of the facility;<PRTPAGE P="386"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Name, address, and telephone and fax number of the operator of the facility or his or her authorized representative;</P>
            <P>(iii) A description of the facility, including its physical plant, primary function, scope of operation, and, if applicable, its relationship to a larger corporate entity; and</P>
            <P>(iv) A description of the specific laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking accreditation.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon receipt of the application, APHIS will review the application to identify the scope of the assessment that will be required to adequately review the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation. Before the assessment of the facility begins, the applicant's representative must agree, in writing, to fulfill the accreditation procedure, especially to receive the assessment team, to supply any information needed for the evaluation of the facility, and to enter into a trust fund agreement as provided by paragraph (c) of this section to pay the fees charged to the applicant facility regardless of the result of the assessment and to pay the charges of subsequent maintenance of the accreditation of the facility. Once the agreement has been signed, APHIS will assemble an assessment team and commence the assessment as soon as circumstances permit. The assessment team will measure the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation against the specific standards identified by the Administrator for those services by reviewing the facility in the following areas:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Physical plant.</E> The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must meet the criteria identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Equipment.</E> The facility's personnel must possess or have unrestricted access to the equipment (e.g., microscopes, computers, scales, triers, etc.) identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation. The calibration and monitoring of that equipment must be documented and conform to prescribed standards.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Methods of testing or inspection.</E> The facility must have a quality manual or equivalent documentation that describes the system in place at the facility for the conduct of the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility seeks accreditation. The manual must be available to, and in use by, the facility personnel who perform the services. The methods and procedures followed by the facility to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation must be commensurate with those identified in the accreditation standards and must be consistent with or equivalent to recognized international standards for such testing or inspection.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Personnel.</E> The management and facility personnel accountable for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking accreditation must be identified and must possess the training, education, or experience identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the testing or inspection services for which the facility seeks accreditation, and that training, education, or experience must be documented.</P>
            <P>(4) To retain accreditation, the facility must agree to:</P>
            <P>(i) Observe the specific standards applicable to its area of accreditation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Be assessed and evaluated on a periodic basis by means of proficiency testing or check samples;</P>
            <P>(iii) Demonstrate on request that it is able to perform the tests or inspection services representative of those for which it is accredited;</P>
            <P>(iv) Resolve all identified deficiencies;</P>

            <P>(v) Notify APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days following its occurrence, of any change in key management personnel or facility staff accountable for the laboratory testing or <PRTPAGE P="387"/>phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is accredited; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Report to APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days following its occurrence, any change involving the location, ownership, physical plant, equipment, or other conditions that existed at the facility at the time accreditation was granted.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees and trust fund agreement.</E> The fees charged by APHIS in connection with the initial accreditation of a non-government facility and the maintenance of that accreditation shall be adequate to recover the costs incurred by the government in the course of APHIS' accreditation activities. To cover those costs, the operator of the facility seeking accreditation must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS under which the operator of the facility will pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement in the pre-accreditation assessment process and the maintenance of the facility's accreditation. Those costs shall include administrative expenses incurred in those activities, such as laboratory fees for evaluating check test results, and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the APHIS in performing those activities. The operator of the facility must deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the operator of the facility must deposit another certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS' services will be completed. After a final audit at the conclusion of the pre-accreditation assessment, any overpayment of funds will be returned to the operator of the facility or held on account until needed for future activities related to the maintenance of the facility's accreditation.</P>

With respect to places of duty within the metropolitan area of the employee's headquarters, such CTT period shall not exceed 3 hours. It shall be administratively determined from time to time which days constitute holidays. The circumstances under which such CTT periods shall be charged and the percentage applicable in each circumstance are as reflected in the following table:</P>

            <P>(8) <E T="03">Limitation on charges.</E> Airlines and cruise lines will not be charged reimbursable overtime for passenger inspection services required for any aircraft or cruise ship on which a passenger arrived who has paid the international passenger AQI user fee for that flight or cruise.</P>

            <P>(3)(i) Each exporter who receives a certificate issued on behalf of APHIS by a designated State or county inspector must pay an administrative user fee, as shown in the following table. The administrative fee can be remitted by the exporter directly to APHIS through the Phytosanitary Certificate Issuance and Tracking System (PCIT), provided that the exporter has a PCIT account and submits the application for the export certificate through the PCIT. If the PCIT is not used, the State or county issuing the certificate is responsible for collecting the fee and remitting it monthly to the U.S. Bank, United States Department of Agriculture, APHIS, AQI, P.O.

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Treatment provider.</E> (i) Private entities that provide AQI treatment services to importers are responsible for collecting the AQI treatment user fee from the importer for whom the service is provided. Treatment providers must collect the AQI treatment fee applicable at the time the treatment is applied.</P>
            <P>(ii) When AQI treatment services are provided by APHIS, APHIS will collect the AQI treatment fee applicable at the time the treatment is applied from the person receiving the services. Remittances must be made by check or money order, payable in United States dollars, through a United States bank, to “The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.”</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Collection of fees.</E> (i) In cases where APHIS is not providing the AQI treatment and collecting the associated fee, AQI user fees collected from importers pursuant to this paragraph shall be held in trust for the United States by the person collecting such fees, by any person holding such fees, or by the person who is ultimately responsible for remittance of such fees to APHIS. AQI user fees collected from importers shall be accounted for separately and shall be regarded as trust funds held by the person possessing such fees as agents, for the beneficial interest of the United States. All such user fees held by any person shall be property in which the person holds only a possessory interest and not an equitable interest. As compensation for collecting, handling, and remitting the AQI treatment user fees, the person holding such user fees shall be entitled to any interest or other investment return earned on the user fees between the time of collection and the time the user fees are due to be remitted to APHIS under this section. Nothing in this section shall affect APHIS' right to collect interest from the person holding such user fees for late remittance.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Remittance and statement procedures.</E> (i) The treatment provider that collects the AQI treatment user fee must remit the fee to USDA, APHIS, AQI, PO Box 979044, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000.</P>
            <P>(ii) AQI treatment user fees must be remitted to [address to be added in final rule] for receipt no later than 31 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which the AQI user fees were collected. Late payments will be subject to interest, penalty, and handling charges as provided in the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3717).</P>
            <P>(iii) The remitter must mail with the remittance a written statement to USDA, APHIS, AQI, PO Box 979044, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000. The statement must include the following information:</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment methods.</E> For payment of any of the AQI user fees required in paragraph (g) of this section, we will accept personal checks for amounts less than $100, and checks drawn on commercial accounts, cashier's checks, certified checks, traveler's checks, and money orders for any amount. All payments must be for the exact amount due.</P>

If the services requested are performed on a Sunday, the hourly user fee rate will be $74, or $18.50 per quarter hour, with a $18.50 minimum. If the services requested are performed on a day other than Sunday outside the normal tour of duty of the employee providing the service, the hourly user fee rate will be $65, or $16.25 per quarter hour, with a $16.25 minimum:</P>

            <P>Promptly following the seizures or other receipt of any property specified in § 356.1 and determined under § 356.2 to have a value greater than $10,000, the Deputy Administrator shall mail a notice of seizure by registered or certified mail to the current or last known or reasonable ascertainable address, return receipt requested, to persons known or reasonably ascertained to be the owner or agent of the seized property and to any other person having an interest in the property. Such notice shall describe the seized property, shall state the time, date, place, and reason for the seizure, that there is a right to petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture pursuant to § 356.7, and shall state that action shall be taken in accordance with this part. Promptly following the seizure of such property, the Secretary shall also submit a report concerning such property to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the seizure was made for institution of forfeiture proceedings in the U.S. District Court.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">When authorized.</E> The Secretary shall take measures to obtain forfeiture in accordance with this section <PRTPAGE P="423"/>of any property specified in § 356.1 and determined under § 356.2 to have a value of $10,000 or less.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner of seized property.</E> A person claiming to be an owner or to have an interest in any property specified in § 356.1 with a value of $10,000 or less may waive any rights to any procedures relating to forfeiture under this subpart by signing a statement providing for waiver of such rights.</P>
            <P>(1) The Deputy Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, by posting for 21 days in a conspicuous place accessible to the public at the Plant Protection and Quarantine Enforcement office nearest the place of seizure.

Promptly following seizure of property, the Deputy Administrator shall issue a notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture.

The time and date of posting shall be indicated on the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Filing a claim and bond.</E> Upon issuance of the notice of proposed forfeiture, any person claiming ownership of or other interest in the seized property may file with the office specified in the notice a claim to the property and a bond in the amount of $250, with sureties to be approved by the Deputy Administrator, conditioned that in case of condemnation of the articles so claimed, the obligor shall pay all the costs and expenses of the proceedings to obtain such condemnation. Any claim and bond must be received in such office within 20 days after posting of the notice of proposed forfeiture, and shall state claimant's interest in the property. The Deputy Administrator may extend the 20 day period with an appropriate statement on the posted notice of proposed forfeiture, if necessary, to allow a person deemed to have an interest in the property at least 10 days to file such a claim and bond after receipt of a notice of proposed forfeiture. The bond shall be on a U.S. Customs Form 4615 or on a similar form provided by Plant Protection and Quarantine. There shall be endorsed on <PRTPAGE P="424"/>the bond a list or schedule in substantially the following form which shall be signed by the claimant in the presence of the witnesses to the bond, and attested by the witnesses:

The declaration shall state that in response to the notice a proper claim and bond were not timely received by the proper office from any claimant, and that, therefore, all potential claimants are deemed to admit the truth of the allegations of the notice. The declaration shall conclude with an order of condemnation and forfeiture of the property to the United States for disposition according to law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any person who has an interest in any property specified in § 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, or any person who has incurred or is alleged to have incurred a forfeiture of any such property, may file with the Deputy Administrator a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture while the property is in the custody of the Deputy Administrator.</P>
            <P>(b) A petition filed with the Deputy Administrator need not be in any particular form, but must contain the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the property:</P>
            <P>(2) The time, date, and place of seizure;</P>
            <P>(3) Evidence of the petitioner's interest in the property such as contracts, bills of sale, invoices, security interests, certificates of title; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement of all facts and circumstances relied upon by the petitioners to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.</P>
            <P>(c) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner or the petitioner's attorney at law. If the petitioner is a business, the petition must be signed by a partner, officer, or petitioner's attorney at law.</P>
            <P>(d) Upon receiving the petition, the Deputy Administrator shall decide whether or not to grant relief. In making a decision, the Deputy Administrator shall consider the information submitted by the petitioner, as well as any other available information relating to the matter, and may require that testimony be taken concerning the petition.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Deputy Administrator finds that the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the petitioner to violate the law or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture or alleged forfeiture, the Deputy Administrator may remit or mitigate the same upon terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and just. However, remission or mitigation will not be made if such action would frustrate the purposes of the Act or Convention. As an example, this section does not allow remission or mitigation with respect to terrestrial plants that are without documentation required under 50 CFR chapter I.</P>
            <P>(f) The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing concerning whether the petition was granted or denied, and shall state the reasons therefor. If the petition is denied fully or in part, the petitioner may then file a supplemental petition, but no supplemental petition shall be considered unless it is received within 60 days from the date of the Deputy Administrator's notification concerning the original petition. The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing concerning the action taken in response to the supplemental petition, and shall state the reasons therefor.</P>

            <P>The Lacey Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 3371 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), makes it unlawful to, among other things, import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant, with some limited exceptions, taken, possessed, transported or sold in violation of any Federal, State, tribal, or foreign law that protects plants. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful to make or submit any false record, account, or label for, or any false identification of, any plant covered by the Act. In addition, the Act requires that importers submit a declaration at the time of importation for plants and plant products. Common cultivars (except trees) and common food crops are among the categorical exclusions to the provisions of the Act. The Act does not define the terms “common cultivar” and “common food crop” but instead gives authority to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of the Interior to define these terms by regulation. The regulations in this part provide the required definitions.</P>

            <P>(1) No safeguards adequate or appropriate to prevent dissemination of the noxious weed can be implemented; or</P>
            <P>(2) The destructive potential of the noxious weed, should it escape despite proposed safeguards, outweighs the probable benefits to be derived from the proposed movement and use of the noxious weed; or</P>
            <P>(3) The responsible person, or the responsible person's agent, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous permit and failed to demonstrate the ability or intent to observe them in the future; or</P>
            <P>(4) The movement could impede an APHIS eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program; or</P>
            <P>(5) A State plant regulatory official objects to the issuance of the permit on the grounds that granting the permit will pose a risk of dissemination of the noxious weed into the State; or</P>
            <P>(6) The application for the permit contains information that is found to be materially false, fraudulent, or deceptive; or</P>
            <P>(7) APHIS may deny a permit to a person who has previously failed to comply with any APHIS regulation.</P>
            <P>(b) The Administrator may revoke any outstanding permit when:</P>
            <P>(1) After the issuance of the permit, information is received that constitutes cause for the denial of an application for permit under paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(2) The responsible person has not maintained the safeguards or otherwise observed the conditions specified in the permit.</P>
            <P>(c) If a permit is orally revoked, APHIS will provide the reasons for the withdrawal of the permit in writing within 10 days. Any person whose permit has been revoked or any person who has been denied a permit may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the revocation or denial. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the permit was wrongfully revoked or denied. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>When a permit for the movement of a noxious weed is revoked by the Administrator and not reinstated under § 360.304(c), further movement of the noxious weed covered by the permit into or through the United States, or interstate, is prohibited unless authorized by another permit. The responsible person must arrange for disposal of the noxious weed in question in a manner that the Administrator determines is <PRTPAGE P="432"/>adequate to prevent noxious weed dissemination. The Administrator may seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner as the Administrator deems appropriate, any noxious weed that is moved without compliance with any conditions in the permit or after the permit has been revoked whenever the Administrator deems it necessary in order to prevent the dissemination of any noxious weed into or within the United States.</P>

            <P>(a) Evidence that the species is distributed throughout its potential range or has spread too far to implement effective control.</P>
            <P>(b) Evidence that control efforts have been unsuccessful and further efforts are unlikely to succeed.</P>
            <P>(c) For cultivars of a listed noxious weed, scientific evidence that the cultivar has a combination of risk elements that result in a low pest risk. For example, the cultivar may have a narrow habitat suitability, low dispersal potential, evidence of sterility, inability to cross-pollinate with introduced wild types, or few if any potential negative impacts on the economy or environment of the United States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preemption of State and local laws.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate in foreign commerce any noxious weed in order to control it, eradicate it, or prevent its dissemination. A State or political subdivision of a State also may not impose prohibitions or restrictions upon the movement in interstate commerce of noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a regulation or order to prevent the dissemination of the noxious weed within the United States. The only exceptions to this are:</P>
            <P>(1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or political subdivision of a State are consistent with and do not exceed the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary; or</P>
            <P>(2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data or a thorough risk assessment.</P>
            <P>(b) Therefore, in accordance with section 436 of the Plant Protection Act, the regulations in this part preempt all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with or exceed the regulations in this part unless a special need request has been granted in accordance with the regulations in §§ 301.1 through 301.13 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) All lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported into the United States must be accompanied by a declaration from the importer of the seed or screenings. The declaration must state the kind, variety, and origin of each lot of seed or screenings and the use for which the seed or screenings are being imported.</P>
            <P>(b) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes must be labeled to indicate the identification code or designation for the lot of seed; the name of each kind or kind and variety of agricultural seed or the name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in the lot in excess of 5 percent of the whole; and the designation “hybrid” when the lot contains hybrid seed. Kind and variety names used on the label shall conform to the kind and variety names used in the definitions of “agricultural seed” and “vegetable seed” in § 361.1. If any seed in the lot has been treated, each container must be further labeled, in type no smaller than 8 point, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The label must indicate that the seed has been treated and provide the name of the substance or process used to treat the seed. Substance names used on the label shall be the commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.</P>
            <P>(i) Commonly accepted coined names are commonly recognized as names of particular substances, e.g., thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone.</P>
            <P>(ii) Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms “mercury” or “mercurial” may be used in labeling all types of mercurials.</P>
            <P>(iii) Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane).</P>

            <P>(2) If the seed has been treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic substance harmful to humans and vertebrate animals, the label must include a representation of a skull and crossbones and a statement indicating that the seed has been treated with poison. The skull and crossbones must be at least twice the size of the type used for the information provided on the label, and the poison warning statement must be written in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting color. Mercurials and similarly toxic substances include the following:

            <P>(a) All agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported into the United States shall be made available for examination by an APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival and shall remain at the port of first arrival until released by an APHIS inspector. Lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings may enter the United States without meeting the sampling requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if the lot is:</P>
            <P>(1) Seed that is not being imported for seeding (planting) purposes and the declaration required by § 361.3(a) states the purpose for which the seed is being imported;</P>
            <P>(2) Seed that is being shipped in bond through the United States;</P>
            <P>(3) Screenings from seeds of wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, field corn, sorghum, broomcorn, flax, millet, proso, soybeans, cowpeas, field peas, or field beans that are not being imported for seeding (planting) purposes and the declaration accompanying the screenings as required under § 361.2(a) indicates that the screenings are being imported for processing or manufacturing purposes;</P>
            <P>(4) Seed that is being imported for sowing for experimental or breeding purposes, is not for sale, is limited in quantity to the amount indicated in column 3 of table 1 of § 361.5, and is accompanied by a declaration stating the purpose for which it is being imported (seed imported for increase purposes only will not be considered as being imported for experimental or breeding purposes); or</P>

            <P>(5) Seed that was grown in the United States, exported, and is now returning <PRTPAGE P="440"/>to the United States, provided that the person importing the seed into the United States furnishes APHIS with the following documentation:</P>
            <P>(i) Export documents indicating the quantity of seed and number of containers, the date of exportation from the United States, the distinguishing marks on the containers at the time of exportation, and the name and address of the United States exporter;</P>
            <P>(ii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was not admitted into the commerce of that country; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was not commingled with other seed after being exported to that country.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in §§ 361.5(a)(2) and 361.7, samples will be taken from all agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes prior to being released into the commerce of the United States.</P>
            <P>(1) Samples of seed will be taken from each lot of seed in accordance with § 361.5 to determine whether any seeds of noxious weeds listed in § 361.6(a) are present. If seeds of noxious weeds are present at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b), the lot of seed will be deemed to be adulterated and will be rejected for entry into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes. Once deemed adulterated, the lot of seed must be:</P>
            <P>(i) Exported from the United States;</P>
            <P>(ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector;</P>
            <P>(iii) Cleaned under APHIS monitoring at a seed-cleaning facility that is operated in accordance with § 361.8(a); or</P>
            <P>(iv) If the lot of seed is adulterated with the seeds of a noxious weed listed in § 361.6(a)(2), the seed may be allowed entry into the United States for feeding or manufacturing purposes, provided the importer withdraws the original declaration and files a new declaration stating that the seed is being imported for feeding or manufacturing purposes and that no part of the seed will be used for seeding (planting) purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) Seed deemed adulterated may not be mixed with any other seed unless the Administrator determines that two or more lots of seed deemed adulterated are of substantially the same quality and origin. In such cases, the Administrator may allow the adulterated lots of seed to be mixed for cleaning as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) If the labeling of a lot of seed is false or misleading in any respect, the seed will be rejected for entry into the United States. A falsely labeled lot of seed must be:</P>
            <P>(i) Exported from the United States;</P>
            <P>(ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The seed may be allowed entry into the United States if the labeling is corrected under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector to accurately reflect the character of the lot of seed.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Sample sizes.</E> As provided in § 361.4(b), samples of seed will be taken from each lot of seed being imported for seeding (planting) purposes to determine whether any seeds of noxious weeds listed in § 361.6(a) are present. The samples shall be drawn in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Unused portions of samples of rare or expensive seeds will be returned by APHIS upon request of the importer.</P>

            <P>(1) A minimum sample of not less than 1 quart shall be drawn from each lot of agricultural seed; a minimum sample of not less than 1 pint shall be drawn from each lot of vegetable seed, except that a sample of <FR>1/4</FR> pint will be sufficient for a vegetable seed importation of 5 pounds or less. The minimum sample shall be divided repeatedly until a working sample of proper weight has been obtained. If a mechanical divider cannot be used or is not available, the sample shall be thoroughly mixed, then placed in a pile; the pile shall be divided repeatedly into halves until a working sample of the proper weight remains. The weights of the working samples for noxious weed examination for each lot of seed are <PRTPAGE P="441"/>shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section. If the lot of seed is a mixture, the following methods shall be used to determine the weight of the working sample:</P>
            <P>(i) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of one predominant kind of seed or a group of kinds of similar size, the weight of the working sample shall be the weight shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section for the kind or group of kinds that comprises more than 50 percent of the sample.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of two or more kinds or groups of kinds of different sizes, none of which comprises over 50 percent of the sample, the weight of the working sample shall be the weighted average (to the nearest half gram) of the weight shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section for each of the kinds that comprise the sample, as determined by the following method:</P>
            <P>(A) Multiply the percentage of each component of the mixture (rounded off to the nearest whole number) by the sample sizes shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section;</P>
            <P>(B) Add all these products;</P>
            <P>(C) Total the percentages of all components of the mixtures; and</P>
            <P>(D) Divide the sum in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the total in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) It is not ordinarily practical to sample and test small lots of seed offered for entry. The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed not ordinarily sampled are shown in column 2 of table 1 of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed allowed entry without sampling for sowing for experimental or breeding purposes as provided in § 361.4(a)(4) are shown in column 3 of table 1 of this section.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of sampling.</E> (1) When an importation consists of more than one lot, each lot shall be sampled separately.</P>
            <P>(2) For lots of six or fewer bags, each bag shall be sampled. A total of at least five trierfuls shall be taken from the lot.</P>
            <P>(3) For lots of more than six bags, five bags plus at least 10 percent of the number of bags in the lot shall be sampled. (Round off numbers with decimals to the nearest whole number, raising 0.5 to the next whole number.) Regardless of the lot size, it is not necessary to sample more than 30 bags.</P>
            <P>(4) When the lot of seed to be sampled is comprised of seed in small containers that cannot practically be sampled as described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, entire unopened containers may be taken in sufficient number to supply a sample that meets the minimum size requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Drawing samples.</E> Samples will not be drawn unless each container is labeled to show the lot designation and the name of the kind and variety of each agricultural seed, or kind and variety of each vegetable seed, appearing on the invoice and other entry papers, and a declaration has been filed by the importer as required under § 361.2(a). In order to secure a representative sample, an APHIS inspector will draw equal portions from evenly distributed parts of the quantity of seed to be sampled; the APHIS inspector, therefore, must be given access to all parts of that quantity.</P>
            <P>(1) For free-flowing seed in bags or in bulk, a probe or trier shall be used. For small free-flowing seed in bags, a probe or trier long enough to sample all portions of the bag shall be used. When drawing more than one trierful of seed from a bag, a different path through the seed shall be used when drawing each sample.</P>
            <P>(2) For non-free-flowing seed in bags or bulk that may be difficult to sample with a probe or trier, samples shall be obtained by thrusting one's hand into the seed and withdrawing representative portions. The hand shall be inserted in an open position with the fingers held closely together while the hand is being inserted and the portion withdrawn. When more than one handful is taken from a bag, the handfuls shall be taken from well-separated points.</P>
            <P>(3) When more than one sample is drawn from a single lot, the samples may be combined into a composite sample unless it appears that the quantity of seed represented as a lot is not of uniform quality, in which case the separate samples shall be forwarded together, but without being combined into a composite sample.</P>

            <P>(d) In most cases, samples will be drawn and examined by an APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival. The APHIS inspector may release a shipment if no contaminants are found and the labeling is sufficient. If contaminants are found or the labeling of the seed is insufficient, the APHIS inspector may forward the sample to the USDA Seed Examination Facility (SEF), Beltsville, MD, for analysis, testing, or examination. APHIS will notify the owner or consignee of the seed that samples have been drawn and forwarded to the SEF and that the shipment must be held intact pending a decision by APHIS as to whether the seed is within the noxious weed seed tolerances of § 361.6 and is accurately labeled. If the decision pending is with regard to the noxious weed seed content of the seed and the seed has been <PRTPAGE P="447"/>determined to be accurately labeled, the seed may be released for delivery to the owner or consignee under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) The owner or consignee executes with Customs either a Customs single-entry bond or a Customs term bond, as appropriate, in such amount as is prescribed by applicable Customs regulations;</P>
            <P>(2) The bond must contain a condition for the redelivery of the seed or any part thereof upon demand of the Port Director of Customs at any time;</P>
            <P>(3) Until the seed is approved for entry upon completion of APHIS' examination, the seed must be kept intact and not tampered with in any way, or removed from the containers except under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector; and</P>
            <P>(4) The owner or consignee must keep APHIS informed as to the location of the seed until it is finally entered into the commerce of the United States.</P>

            <P>(a) In addition to meeting the declaration and labeling requirements of <PRTPAGE P="449"/>§ 361.2 and all other applicable provisions of this part, all Canadian-origin agricultural seed and Canadian-origin vegetable seed imported into the United States from Canada for seeding (planting) purposes or cleaning must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or by a private seed laboratory accredited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Samples of seed shall be drawn using sampling methods comparable to those detailed in § 361.5 of this part. The seed analyst who examines the seed at the laboratory must be accredited to analyze the kind of seed covered by the certificate.</P>
            <P>(1) If the seed is being imported for seeding (planting) purposes, the certificate of analysis must verify that the seed meets the noxious weed seed tolerances of § 361.6. Such seed will not be subject to the sampling requirements of § 361.3(b).</P>
            <P>(2) If the seed is being imported for cleaning, the certificate of analysis must name the kinds of noxious weed seeds that are to be removed from the lot of seed. Seed being imported for cleaning must be consigned to a facility operated in accordance with § 361.8(a).</P>
            <P>(b) Coated or pelleted agricultural seed and coated or pelleted vegetable seed of Canadian origin may be imported into the United States if the seed was analyzed prior to being coated or pelleted and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) Screenings otherwise prohibited under this part may be imported from Canada if the screenings are imported for processing or manufacture and are consigned to a facility operating under a compliance agreement as provided by § 361.8(b).</P>

            <P>(a) Imported seed that is found to contain noxious weed seeds at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b) may be cleaned under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector. The cleaning will be at the expense of the owner or consignee.</P>
            <P>(1) At the location where the seed is being cleaned, the identity of the seed must be maintained at all times to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The refuse from the cleaning must be placed in containers and securely sealed and identified. Upon completion of the cleaning, a representative sample of the seed will be analyzed by a registered seed technologist, an official seed laboratory, or by APHIS; if the seed is found to be within the noxious weed tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b), the seed may be allowed entry into the United States;</P>
            <P>(2) The refuse from the cleaning must be destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector at the expense of the owner or consignee of the seed.</P>
            <P>(3) Any person engaged in the business of cleaning imported seed may enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section to facilitate the cleaning of seed imported into the United States under this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person engaged in the business of processing screenings who wishes to process screenings imported from Canada under § 361.7(c) that are otherwise prohibited under this part must enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) A compliance agreement for the cleaning of imported seed or processing of otherwise prohibited screenings from Canada shall be a written agreement <SU>1</SU>

              <FTREF/> between a person engaged in such a business, the State in which the business operates, and APHIS, wherein the person agrees to comply with the provisions of this part and any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. Any compliance agreement may be canceled orally or in writing by the APHIS inspector who is monitoring its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the person who entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision <PRTPAGE P="450"/>and the reasons for the decision shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Classification of actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements.</E> This class of policymakings and rulemakings seeks to establish programmatic approaches to animal and plant health issues. Actions in this class typically involve the agency, an entire program, or a substantial program component and are characterized by their broad scope (often global or nationwide) and potential effect (impacting a wide range of environmental quality values or indicators, whether or not affected individuals or systems may be completely identified at the time). Ordinarily, new or untried methodologies, strategies, or techniques to deal with pervasive threats to animal and plant health are the subjects of this class of actions. Alternative means of dealing with those threats usually have not been well developed. Actions in this class include:</P>
            <P>(1) Formulation of contingent response strategies to combat future widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases; and</P>
            <P>(2) Adoption of strategic or other long-range plans that purport to adopt for future program application a preferred course of action.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Actions normally requiring environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact statements.</E> This class of APHIS actions may involve the agency as a whole or an entire program, but generally is related to a more discrete program component and is characterized by its limited scope (particular sites, species, or activities) and potential effect (impacting relatively few environmental values or systems). Potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed action are not considered potentially significant at the outset of the planning process. Any effects of the action on environmental resources (such as air, water, soil, plant communities, animal populations, or others) or indicators (such as dissolved oxygen content of water) can be reasonably identified, and mitigation measures are generally available and have been successfully employed. Unless the actions are categorically excluded as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, actions in this class include:</P>
            <P>(1) Policymakings and rulemakings that seek to remedy specific animal and plant health risks or that may affect opportunities on the part of the public to influence agency environmental planning and decisionmaking. Examples of this category of actions include:</P>
            <P>(i) Development of program plans that seek to adopt strategies, methods, and techniques as the means of dealing with particular animal and plant health risks that may arise in the future; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Implementation of program plans at the site-specific, action level.</P>
            <P>(2) Planning, design, construction, or acquisition of new facilities, or proposals for modifications to existing facilities.</P>
            <P>(3) Disposition of waste and other hazardous or toxic materials at laboratories and other APHIS facilities.</P>
            <P>(4) Approvals and issuance of permits for proposals involving regulated genetically engineered organisms or products, or regulated nonindigenous species.</P>

            <P>(5) Programs or statewide activities to reduce damage or harm by a specific <PRTPAGE P="460"/>wildlife species or group of species, such as deer or birds, or to reduce a specific type of damage or harm, such as protection of agriculture from wildlife depredation and disease; for the management of rabies in wildlife; or for the protection of threatened or endangered species.</P>
            <P>(6) Research or testing that will be conducted outside of a laboratory or other containment area or reaches a stage of development (e.g., formulation of premarketing strategies) that forecasts an irretrievable commitment to the resulting products or technology.</P>
            <P>(7) Determination of nonregulated status for genetically engineered organisms.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Categorically excluded actions.</E> This class of APHIS actions shares many of the same characteristics—particularly in terms of the extent of program involvement, as well as the scope, effect of, and the availability of alternatives to proposed actions—as the class of actions that normally requires environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact statements. The major difference is that the means through which adverse environmental impacts may be avoided or minimized have actually been built right into the actions themselves. The efficacy of this approach generally has been established through testing and/or monitoring. The Department of Agriculture has also promulgated a listing of categorical exclusions that are applicable to all agencies within the department unless their procedures provide otherwise. Those categorical exclusions, codified at 7 CFR 1b.3(a), are entirely appropriate for APHIS. Other actions in this class include:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Routine measures.</E> (i) Routine measures, such as identifications, inspections, surveys, sampling that does not cause physical alteration of the environment, testing, seizures, quarantines, removals, sanitizing, inoculations, control, and monitoring employed by agency programs to pursue their missions and functions. Such measures may include the use—according to any label instructions or other lawful requirements and consistent with standard, published program practices and precautions—of chemicals, pesticides, or other potentially hazardous or harmful substances, materials, and target-specific devices or remedies, provided that such use meets all of the following criteria (insofar as they may pertain to a particular action):</P>
            <P>(A) The use is localized or contained in areas where humans are not likely to be exposed, and is limited in terms of quantity, i.e., individualized dosages and remedies;</P>
            <P>(B) The use will not cause contaminants to enter water bodies, including wetlands;</P>
            <P>(C) The use does not adversely affect any federally protected species or critical habitat; and</P>
            <P>(D) The use does not cause bioaccumulation.</P>
            <P>(ii) Examples of routine measures include:</P>
            <P>(A) Inoculation or treatment of discrete herds of livestock or wildlife undertaken in contained areas (such as a barn or corral, a zoo, an exhibition, or an aviary);</P>
            <P>(B) Use of vaccinations or inoculations including new vaccines (e.g., genetically engineered vaccines) and applications of existing vaccines to new species provided that the project is conducted in a controlled and limited manner, and the impacts of the vaccine can be predicted; and</P>
            <P>(C) Isolated (for example, along a highway) weed control efforts.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Research and development activities.</E> (i) Activities limited in magnitude, frequency, and scope that occur in laboratories, facilities, pens, or field sites. Examples are:</P>
            <P>(A) Vaccination trials that occur on groups of animals in areas designed to limit interaction with similar animals, or include other controls needed to mitigate potential risk.</P>
            <P>(B) Laboratory research involving the evaluation and use of chemicals in a manner not specifically listed on the product label pursuant to applicable Federal authorizations.</P>

            <P>(C) The development and/or production (including formulation, packaging or repackaging, movement, and distribution) of articles such as program materials, devices, reagents, and biologics that were approved and/or licensed in accordance with existing regulations, or that are for evaluation in <PRTPAGE P="461"/>confined animal, plant, or insect populations under conditions that prevent exposure to the general population.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Process for rapid response to emergencies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>When it is determined (by the Administrator or the delegated Agency official responsible for environmental review) that an emergency exists that requires immediate action before preparing and completing the usual NEPA review, then the provisions of this section apply.</P>
            <P>(a) The Administrator or the delegated Agency official responsible for environmental review may take actions that are necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency and that are urgently needed to prevent imminent damage to public health or safety, or prevent threats to valuable resources. When taking such actions, the Administrator or the delegated Agency official responsible for environmental review will consider the probable environmental consequences of the emergency action and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practicable.</P>
            <P>(b) If a proposed emergency action is normally analyzed in an environmental assessment as described in § 372.5 and the nature and scope of proposed emergency actions are such that there is insufficient time to prepare an EA and FONSI before commencing the proposed action, the Administrator shall consult with APHIS' Chief of Environmental and Risk Analysis Services about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. APHIS' Chief of Environmental and Risk Analysis Services may authorize emergency alternative arrangements for completing the required NEPA compliance documentation. Any alternative arrangements must be documented and notice of their use provided to CEQ.</P>
            <P>(c) If a proposed emergency action is likely to result in significant environmental impacts, then APHIS will immediately consult with CEQ and request alternative arrangements in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1506.11. Such alternative arrangements will apply only to the proposed actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other proposed actions remain subject to NEPA analysis and documentation in accordance with the CEQ regulations and these regulations.</P>
