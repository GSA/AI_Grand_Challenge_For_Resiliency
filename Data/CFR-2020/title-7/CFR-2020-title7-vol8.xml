      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) A marketing agreement or a marketing order may be proposed by the Secretary or by any other person. If any person other than the Secretary proposes a marketing agreement or marketing order, he shall file with the Administrator a written application, together with at least four copies of the proposal, requesting the Secretary to hold a hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such proposal, the Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made and such consideration thereof to be given as, in his opinion, are warranted. If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator to conclude that the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order will not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, or that for other proper reasons a hearing should not be held on the proposal, he shall deny the application, and promptly notify the applicant of such denial, which notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for the denial.</P>
              <P>(b) If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator to conclude that the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, or if the Secretary desires to propose a marketing agreement or marketing order, he shall sign and cause to be served a notice of hearing, as provided in this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing and contents of the notice of hearing.</E> The proceeding shall be instituted by filing the notice of hearing with the hearing clerk. The notice of hearing shall contain a reference to the authority under which the marketing agreement or marketing order is proposed; shall define the scope of the hearing as specifically as may be practicable; shall contain either the terms or substance of the proposed marketing <PRTPAGE P="10"/>agreement or marketing order or a description of the subjects and issues involved and shall state the industry, area, and class of persons to be regulated, the time and place of such hearing, and the place where copies of such proposed marketing agreement or marketing order may be obtained or examined. The time of the hearing shall not be less than 15 days after the date of publication of the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> as provided in this subpart, unless the Administrator shall determine that an emergency exists which requires a shorter period of notice, in which case the period of notice shall be that which the Administrator may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, in the case of hearings on amendments to marketing agreements or marketing orders, the time of the hearing may be less than 15 days but shall not be less than 3 days after the date of publication of the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Giving notice of hearing and supplemental publicity.</E> (1) The Administrator shall give or cause to be given notice of hearing in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(i) By publication of the notice of hearing in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
              <P>(ii) By mailing a true copy of the notice of hearing, using a postal or other delivery service or electronic communication, to each of the persons known to the Administrator to be interested therein;</P>
              <P>(iii) By issuing a press release containing the complete text or a summary of the contents of the notice of hearing and making the same available to such newspapers in the area proposed to be subjected to regulation as reasonably will tend to bring the ntoice to the attention of the persons interested therein;</P>
              <P>(iv) By forwarding copies of the notice of hearing addressed to the governors of such of the several States of the United States and to executive heads of such of the Territories and possessions of the United States as the Administrator, having due regard for the subject matter of the proposal and the public interest, shall determine, should be notified.</P>
              <P>(2) Legal notice of the hearing shall be deemed to be given if notice is given in the manner provided by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; and failure to give notice in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not affect the legality of the notice.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Record of notice and supplemental publicity.</E> There shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing an affidavit or certificate of the person giving the notice provided in paragraph (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section. In regard to the provisions relating to mailing in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a determination by the Administrator that such provisions have been complied with shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing. In the alternative, if notice is not given in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section there shall be filed with the hearing clerk or submitted to the judge at the hearing a determination by the Administrator that such notice is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest with a brief statement of the reasons for such determination. Determinations by the Administrator as herein provided shall be final.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disqualification of judge.</E> The judge may at any time withdraw as judge in a proceeding if he deems himself to be disqualified. Upon the filing by an interested person in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a judge, the Secretary shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding, after making such investigation or holding such hearings, or both, as he may deem appropriate in the circumstances.</P>

Except as provided in § 900.15(b) such motions and requests shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, the presiding officer if made prior to his certification of the transcript pursuant to § 900.10 or by the Secretary if made thereafter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conduct of the hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Time and place.</E> The hearing shall be held at the time and place fixed in the notice of hearing, unless the judge shall have changed the time or place, in which event the judge shall file with the hearing clerk a notice of such change, which notice shall be given in the same manner as provided in § 900.4 (relating to the giving of notice of the hearing): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, if the change in time or place of hearing is made less than 5 days prior to the date previously fixed for the hearing, the judge, either in addition to or in lieu of causing the notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appearances</E>—(1) <E T="03">Right to appear.</E> At the hearing, any interested person shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or through his authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with respect to matters relevant and material to the proceeding. Any interested person who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under these rules shall, before proceeding to testify, state his name, address, and occupation. If any such person is appearing through a counsel or representative, such person or such counsel or representative shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the hearing, state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or representative, and the names and addresses and occupations of such person and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such counsel or representative shall give such other information respecting his appearance as the judge may request.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Debarment of counsel or representative.</E> Wherever, while a proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person, acting as counsel or representative for any person participating in the proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the judge may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the client to obtain other counsel or other representative. In case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the presiding officer, within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and <PRTPAGE P="12"/>shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order, respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary, as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If any interested person fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to be heard in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Order of procedure.</E> (1) The judge shall, at the opening of the hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the determination provided for in § 900.4(c).</P>
              <P>(2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall announce.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The hearing shall be publicly conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.</P>
              <P>(i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or make affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</P>
              <P>(ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative evidence.</P>
              <P>(iii) The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, he shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Proof and authentication of official records or documents.</E> An official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible as evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> All written statements, charts, tabulations, or similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of the authenticity, relevancy, and materiality of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the record. Such exhibits shall be submitted in quadruplicate and in documentary form. In case the required number of copies is not made available, the judge shall exercise his discretion as to whether said exhibits shall, when practicable, be read in evidence or whether additional copies shall be required to be submitted within a time to be specified by the judge. If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report or document (including the record of any previous hearing) the judge, after inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, or document, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document (including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the direction of the presiding officer.<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice may be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific or commercial fact of established character: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That interested persons shall be given adequate notice, at the hearing or subsequent thereto, of matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Oral argument before judge.</E> Oral argument before the judge shall be in the discretion of the judge. Such argument, when permitted, may be limited by the judge to any extent that he finds necessary for the expeditious disposition of the proceeding and shall be reduced to writing and made part of the transcript.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Briefs, proposed findings and conclusions.</E> The judge shall announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be considered in the formulation of the marketing agreement or marketing order. If the person filing a brief desires the Secretary to consider any objection made by such person to a ruling of the judge, as provided in § 900.8(d), he shall include in the brief a concise statement concerning each such objection, referring where practicable, to the pertinent pages of the transcript.</P>

As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. He shall attach to the original transcript of testimony his certificate stating that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the testimony given at the hearing except in such particulars as he shall specify; and that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced at the hearing with such exceptions as he shall specify. A copy of such certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the transcript of testimony. In accordance with such certificate the hearing clerk shall note upon the official record copy, and cause to be noted on other copies, of the transcript each correction detailed therein by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the text as originally transcribed) at the appropriate place any words necessary to make the same conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the judge. The hearing clerk shall obtain and file certifications to the effect that such corrections have been effected in copies other than the official record copy.</P>

If and when such number of the handlers as the Secretary shall deem sufficient shall have executed the agreement, the Secretary shall execute the agreement. After execution of a marketing agreement, such agreement shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, together with notice of the effective date, shall be given by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The marketing agreement shall not become effective less than 30 days after its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> unless the Secretary, upon good cause found and published with the agreement, fixes an earlier effective date therefor: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no marketing agreement shall become effective as to any person signatory thereto before either (1) it has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received actual notice that the Secretary has executed the agreement and the effective date of the marketing agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of marketing order with marketing agreement.</E> Whenever, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary executes a marketing agreement, and handlers also have executed the same as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, he shall, if he finds that it will tend to effectuate the purposes of the Act, issue and make effective the marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to § 900.13a: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the issuance of such order shall have been approved or favored by producers as required by section 8c(8) of the act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Issuance of marketing order without marketing agreement.</E> If, despite the failure or refusal of handlers to sign the marketing agreement, as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, the Secretary makes the determinations required under section 8c(9) of the Act, the Secretary shall issue and make effective the marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to § 900.13a.</P>

In case the judge has issued an order precluding a person from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the judge, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If the petitioner, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized the dismissal of the proceeding, without further procedure, and with or without prejudice as the judge may determine. In the event that the petitioner appears at the hearing and no representative of the Department appears, the judge shall proceed ex parte to hear the evidence of the petitioner. <E T="03">Provided,</E> That failure on the part of such representative of the Department to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be waiver of the Department's right to file suggested findings of fact, conclusions and order; to be served with a copy of the judge's initial decision and to appeal to the Secretary with respect thereto.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Order of proceeding.</E> Except as may be determined otherwise by the judge, the petitioner shall proceed first at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The hearing shall be publicly conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.</P>
              <P>(i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any witness may, in the discretion of the judge, be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(iii) The judge shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope <PRTPAGE P="25"/>of any examination or cross-examination, or any other ruling of the judge, he shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow which may be pursued in an appeal pursuant to § 900.65 by the party adversely affected by the judge's ruling.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Depositions.</E> The deposition of any witness shall be admitted, in the manner hereinafter provided in and subject to the provisions of § 900.61.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Affidavits.</E> Except as is otherwise provided in this subpart, affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make timely objections) that affidavits may be used.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Proof and authentication of official records or documents.</E> An official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> All written statements, charts, tabulations, or similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the record. Except where the judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit, in addition to the original, shall be filed with the judge for the use of each other party to the proceeding. The judge shall advise the parties as to the exact number of copies which will be required to be filed and shall make and have noted on the record the proper distribution of the copies. If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report, document, or transcript, the judge, after inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, document, or transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report, document, or transcript containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the direction of the judge.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice will be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the parties shall be given adequate notice, at the hearing or by reference in the judge's report or the tentative order or otherwise, of matters so noticed, and (except where official notice is taken, for the first time in the proceeding, in the final order) shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if on appeal the Secretary decides that the judge erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Transcript.</E> Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at actual cost of duplication.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure in lieu of deposition.</E> Before any party may have testimony taken by deposition, said party shall, if practicable, submit to the other party an affidavit which shall set forth the facts to which the witness would testify, if the deposition should be taken. If, after examination of such affidavit, the other party agrees, or (within 10 days after submission of the affidavit) fails to object, that the affidavit may be used in lieu of the deposition, the judge shall admit the affidavit in evidence and shall not order the deposition to be taken.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for taking deposition.</E> Upon the application of a party to the proceeding, the judge may, at any time after the filing of the moving paper, order, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, the taking of testimony by deposition. The application shall be in writing and shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall set forth: (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and address of the person (referred to hereinafter in this section as the <E T="03">judge</E>), qualified under the rules in this part to take depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the proposed time and place of the examination, which shall be at least 15 days after the date of the mailing of the application; and (4) the reasons why such deposition should be taken.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Judge's order for taking deposition.</E> If, after the examination of the application, the judge is of the opinion that the deposition should be taken, he shall order its taking. The order shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall be served upon the parties and shall state: (1) The time and place of the examination (which shall not be less than 10 days after the filing of the order); (2) the name of the judge before whom the examination is to be made; (3) the name of the deponent. The judge and the time and place need not be the same as those suggested in the application.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifications of judge.</E> The deposition shall be taken before the judge, or before a judge authorized by the law of the United States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or before a judge authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure on examination.</E> (1) The deponent shall be examined under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. The testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the judge or by some person under his direction and in his presence. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit written interrogatories to the judge prior to the examination and the judge shall propound such interrogatories to the deponent.</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant must arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination or by written interrogatories. If it is found by the judge, upon the protest of a party to the proceeding, that such party has his residence and his place of business more than 100 miles from the place of the examination and that it would constitute an undue hardship upon such party to be represented at the examination, the applicant will be required to conduct the examination by means of interrogatories. When the examination is conducted by means of interrogatories, copies of the interrogatories shall be served upon the other parties to the proceeding at least five days prior to the date set for the examination, and the other parties shall be afforded an opportunity to file with the judge cross-interrogatories at any time prior to the time of the examination.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Certification by judge.</E> The judge shall certify on the deposition that the deponent was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony. He shall then securely seal the deposition, together with two copies thereof, in an envelope and mail the same by registered mail to the hearing clerk.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of depositions.</E> A deposition ordered and taken in accord with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under the act if the judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and (1) that the witness is dead; or (2) that the witness is at a distance greater than 100 miles from the place of hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, <PRTPAGE P="27"/>sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the attendance of the witness by subpena but has been unable to do so; or (5) that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If a deposition has been taken, and the party upon whose application it was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, the other party may offer the deposition, or any part thereof, in evidence.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Issuance of subpenas.</E> The attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence from any place in the United States on behalf of any party to the proceeding may, by subpena, be required at any designated place of hearing. Subpenas may be issued by the Secretary or by the judge, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, upon a reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity, and reasonable scope thereof.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for subpena duces tecum.</E> Subpenas for the production of documentary evidence, unless issued by the judge upon his own motion, shall be issued only upon a certified written application. Such application shall specify, as exactly as possible, the documents desired and shall show their competency, relevancy, and materiality and the necessity for their production.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service of subpenas.</E> Subpenas may be served (1) by a United States Marshal or his deputy, or (2) by any other person who is not less than 18 years of age, or (3) by registering and mailing a copy of the subpena addressed to the person to be served at his or its last known residence or principal place of business or residence. Proof of service may be made by the return of service on the subpena by the United States Marshal or his deputy; or, if served by an individual other than a United States Marshal or his deputy, by an affidavit of such person stating that he personally served a copy of the subpena upon the person named therein; or, if service was by registered mail, by an affidavit made by the person mailing the subpena that it was mailed as provided in this paragraph and by the signed return post office receipt: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, if the subpena is issued on behalf of the Department, the return receipt without an affidavit of mailing shall be sufficient proof of service. In making personal service, the person making service shall leave a copy of the subpena with the person subpenaed; the original, bearing or accompanied by the required proof of service, shall be returned to the official who issued the same.</P>

Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear, and claims therefor, as to witnesses subpenaed on behalf of the Department, shall be proved before the person issuing the subpena, and, as to witnesses subpenaed on behalf of any other party, shall be presented to such party.</P>

Failure to make such request in writing, within the prescribed time period, shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument. The Secretary, in his discretion, may grant, refuse or limit any request for oral argument on appeal.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Scope of argument.</E> Argument to be heard on appeal, whether oral or in a written brief, shall be limited to the issues raised by the appeal, except that if the Secretary determines that additional issues should be argued, the parties shall be given reasonable notice of such determination, so as to permit preparation of adequate arguments on all the issues to be argued.</P>

In such case, if exceptions are filed within a period of time (to be fixed by the Secretary but not to exceed 20 days) following the service of the tentative order, the Secretary shall give consideration, to and shall make such changes in the tentative order as he deems to be appropriate; otherwise, the tentative order shall become final, as of the day following the date of expiration of the period fixed for the filing of exceptions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duties of referendum agent.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The referendum agent shall also:</P>
              <P>(a) For purposes of mailing, prepare a record of producers which will disclose the name of each such person, his address, the name of the handler who received the producer's milk during the representative period, and the name of the cooperative association, if any, which claims the right to vote for the producer. Such record may be compiled from readily available sources, including the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Records of the Department;</P>
              <P>(2) Producer records supplied by handlers;</P>
              <P>(3) Health authority records;</P>
              <P>(4) Certifications signed by dairy farmers who claim to be producers;</P>
              <P>(5) Any other reliable sources of information which may be available to the referendum agent.</P>
              <P>(b) Apply, as a guide, the following criteria in preparing a record of producers:</P>
              <P>(1) When the order requires approval by an appropriate health authority before a person meets the definition of producer, only those persons having such approval and who otherwise meet the definition may be regarded as producers. When the definition of producer requires the shipment of milk to a handler or a plant as well as health authority approval, only those persons having such approval and whose milk was received by a handler or at a plant may be regarded as producers.</P>

              <P>(2) When the order requries shipment to a handler or to a plant, without regard to health authority approval, a <PRTPAGE P="40"/>person may not be regarded as a producer, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, unless his name appears on the handler's producer records.</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of a producer that is other than an individual, the business unit shall be regarded as the producer.</P>
              <P>(4) No person may be included in the record more than once although he may operate more than one farm, hold more than one health authority approval, or appear on more than one handler's producer records.</P>
              <P>(5) In the event the health authority records are not available, are inaccurate, or are incomplete, the appearance of the producer's name on a handler's records as an approved producer shall be prima facie evidence of health authority approval.</P>
              <P>(6) In the event any handler refuses or fails to make his records available to the referendum agent, a certification signed by the producer shall be regarded by the referendum agent as prima facie evidence that such person is eligible to vote.</P>
              <P>(c) Verify the information supplied by each cooperative association which wishes to vote on behalf of producers, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Examine the records of the cooperative association for the purpose of ascertaining whether each producer claimed by the cooperative association is a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with the cooperative association.</P>
              <P>(2) Identify the persons ascertained to be members of, stockholders in, or under contract with a cooperative association which wishes to vote on behalf of its producers with the names of producers which appear on the record compiled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) In determining whether a cooperative association may vote on behalf of a producer the following criteria shall be used:</P>
              <P>(i) The cooperative association may vote for each producer who is a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with such cooperative association on the date of the order directing that the referendum be conducted.</P>
              <P>(ii) The cooperative association may cast only one ballot for all such producers.</P>
              <P>(iii) Whenever more than one cooperative association claims the right to vote for a producer only the cooperative association which furnished evidence satisfactory to the referendum agent that such association was in fact marketing the milk of the producer on the date of the referendum order may vote for such producer.</P>

              <P>(2) Give public notice of the referendum:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemption from assessments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section specifies criteria for identifying persons eligible to obtain an exemption from the portion of the assessment used to fund marketing promotion activities under a marketing order and the procedures for applying for such an exemption under 7 CFR parts 905, 906, 915, 922, 923, 925, 927, 929, 930, 932, 948, 955, 956, 958, 959, 966, 981, 982, 984, 985, 987, 989, 993, and such other parts (included in 7 CFR parts 905 through 998) covering marketing orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops as may be established or amended to include market promotion. For the purposes of this section, the term “assessment period” means fiscal period, fiscal year, crop year, or marketing year as defined under these parts; the term “marketing promotion” means marketing research and development projects or marketing promotion, including paid advertising designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, or consumption of the applicable commodity.</P>
              <P>(b) A handler who operates under an approved National Organic Program (7 CFR part 205) (NOP) organic handling system plan and is subject to assessments under a part or parts specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be exempt from the portion of the assessment applicable to marketing promotion, including paid advertising, provided that:</P>

              <P>(1) Only agricultural commodities certified as “organic” or “100 percent <PRTPAGE P="48"/>organic” (as defined in the NOP) are eligible for exemption;</P>
              <P>(2) The exemption shall apply to all certified “organic” or “100 percent organic” (as defined in the NOP) products of a handler regardless of whether the agricultural commodity subject to the exemption is handled by a person that also handles conventional or nonorganic agricultural products of the same agricultural commodity as that for which the exemption is claimed;</P>
              <P>(3) The handler maintains a valid certificate of organic operation as issued under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6501-6522)(OFPA) and the NOP regulations issued under OFPA (7 CFR part 205);</P>
              <P>(4) Any handler so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments under such part or parts specified that are associated with any agricultural products that do not qualify for an exemption under this section; and</P>
              <P>(5) For exempted products, any handler so exempted shall be obligated to pay the portion of the assessment associated with the other authorized activities under such part or parts other than marketing promotion, including paid advertising.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment exemption application.</E> (1) To be exempt from paying assessments for these purposes under a part or parts listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the handler shall submit an application to the board or committee established under the applicable part or parts prior to or during the assessment period. This application, Form FV-649, “Certified Organic Handler Application for Exemption from Market Promotion Assessments Paid Under Federal Marketing Orders,” shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) The date, applicable committee or board, and Federal marketing order number;</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicant's full name, company name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address;</P>
              <P>(iii) Certification that the applicant maintains a valid certificate of organic operation under the OFPA and the NOP;</P>
              <P>(iv) Certification that the applicant handles or markets organic products eligible to be labeled “organic” or “100 percent organic” under the NOP;</P>
              <P>(v) Certification that the applicant is otherwise subject to assessments under the Federal marketing order program for which the exemption is requested;</P>
              <P>(vi) The number of organic certified producers for whom they handle or market product (including the applicant);</P>
              <P>(vii) A requirement that the applicant attach a copy of their certificate of organic operation and all applicable producer certificates of organic operation issued by a USDA-accredited certifying agent under the OFPA and the NOP;</P>
              <P>(viii) Certification, as evidenced by signature and date, that all information provided by the applicant is true; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Such other information as the committee or board may require, with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) The handler shall file the application with the committee or board, prior to or during the applicable assessment period, and annually thereafter, as long as the handler continues to be eligible for the exemption. If the person complies with the requirements of this section and is eligible for an assessment exemption, the committee or board will approve the exemption request and provide written notification of such to the applicant within 30 days. If the application is disapproved, the committee or board will provide written notification of the reason(s) for such disapproval within the same timeframe.</P>
              <P>(3) The exemption will apply at the beginning of the next assessable period following notification of approval of the assessment exemption, in writing, by the committee or board.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assessment exemption calculation.</E> (1) The applicable assessment rate for any handler approved for an exemption shall be computed by dividing the committee's or board's estimated non-marketing promotion expenditures by the committee's or board's estimated total expenditures approved by the Secretary and applying that percentage to the assessment rate applicable to all persons for the assessment period. The modified assessment rate shall then be applied to the quantity of certified <PRTPAGE P="49"/>“organic” or “100 percent organic” products handled under an approved organic assessment exemption as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Products handled not subject to an approved organic assessment exemption shall be assessed at the assessment rate applicable to all persons for the assessment period. The committee's or board's estimated non-marketing promotion expenditures shall exclude the direct costs of marketing promotion and the portion of committee's or board's administrative and overhead costs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> salaries, supplies, printing, equipment, rent, contractual expenses, and other applicable costs) to support and administer the marketing promotion activities.</P>
              <P>(2) If a committee or board does not plan to conduct any market promotion activities in a fiscal year, the committee or board may submit a certification to that effect to the Secretary, and as long as no assessments for such fiscal year are used for marketing promotion projects, or the administration of projects are funded by a previous fiscal period's assessments, the committee or board may assess all handlers, regardless of their organic status, the full assessment rate applicable to the assessment period.</P>
              <P>(3) For each assessment period, the Secretary shall review the portion of the assessment rate applicable to marketing promotion for persons eligible for an exemption and, if appropriate, approve the assessment rate.</P>
              <P>(4) When the requirements of this section for exemption no longer apply to a handler, the handler shall inform the committee or board within 30 days and pay the full assessment on all remaining assessable product for all committee or board assessments from the date the handler no longer is eligible to the end of the assessment period.</P>
              <P>(5) Within 30 days following the applicable assessment period, the committee or board shall re-compute the applicable assessment rate for handlers exempt under this section based on the actual expenditures incurred during the applicable assessment period. The Secretary shall review, and if appropriate, approve any change in the portion of the assessment rate for market promotion applicable to exempt handlers, and authorize adjustments for any overpayments or collection of underpayments.</P>

                <P>(a) Before making any recommendations pursuant to § 905.51 for any variety of fruit, the committee shall, with respect to the regulations permitted by § 905.52, submit to the Secretary a detailed report setting forth an advisable marketing policy for such variety for the then current shipping season. Such report shall set forth the proportion of the remainder of the total crop of such variety of fruit (determined by the committee to be available for shipment during the remainder of the shipping season of such variety) deemed advisable by the committee to be shipped during such season.</P>
                <P>(b) In determining each such marketing policy and advisable proportion, the committee shall give due consideration to the following factors relating to citrus fruit produced in Florida and in other States:</P>
                <P>(1) The available crop of each variety of citrus fruit in Florida, and in other States, including the grades and sizes thereof, which grades and sizes in Florida shall be determined by the committee pursuant to § 905.31;</P>

                <P>(2) Limit the shipment of any variety by establishing and maintaining, only in terms of grades or sizes, or both, minimum standards of quality and maturity;</P>

                <P>(4) Establish, prescribe, and fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, marking (including labels and stamps), or pack of the container or containers which may be used in the packaging, transportation, sale, shipment, or other handling of fruit.<PRTPAGE P="59"/>

                <P>(c) Whenever the Secretary finds from the recommendations and reports of the committee, or from other available information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or terminated with respect to any or all shipments of fruit in order to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall so modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation. If the Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall suspend or terminate such regulation.

                <SUBJECT>Procedure for determining handlers' permitted quantities of red seedless grapefruit when a portion of sizes 48 and 56 of such variety is restricted.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) For the purposes of this section, the prior period specified in § 905.52 is hereby established as an average week within the immediately preceding three seasons. Each handler's average week shall be computed by adding the total volume of red seedless grapefruit handled in the immediately preceding three seasons and dividing the total by 99. The average week for handlers with less than three previous seasons of <PRTPAGE P="67"/>shipments shall be calculated by adding the total volume of shipments for the seasons they did ship red seedless grapefruit, divide by the number of seasons, divide further by 33. If crop conditions limit shipments from any or all of the immediately preceding three season(s), the committee may use a prior season or seasons for the purposes of calculating an average week. New handlers with no record of shipments could ship size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit as a percentage of total shipments equal to the percentage applied to other handlers' average week; once such handlers have recorded shipments, their average week shall be calculated as an average of total shipments for the weeks they have shipped red seedless grapefruit during the current season. When used in the regulation of red seedless grapefruit, the term season means the weeks beginning the third Monday in September and ending the first Sunday in the following May. The term <E T="03">regulation period</E> means the 22-week period beginning the third Monday in September of the current season.</P>
                <P>(b) When a size limitation restricts the shipment of a portion of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit during a particular week as provided in § 905.52, the committee shall compute the quantity of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit that may be shipped by each handler by multiplying the handler's calculated average week shipments of such grapefruit by the percentage established by regulation for red seedless grapefruit for that week. Such set percentage may vary from week to week but shall not be less than 25 percent in any week.</P>
                <P>(c) The committee shall notify each handler of the quantity of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit such handler may handle during a particular week.</P>
                <P>(d) During any regulation week for which the Secretary has fixed the percentage of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit, any person who has received an allotment may handle, in addition to their total allotment available, an amount of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit up to 10 percent greater than their allotment. The quantity of the overshipment shall be deducted from the handler's allotment for the following week. Overshipments will not be allowed during the last week of regulation. If the handler fails to use his or her entire allotment, the undershipment is not carried forward to the following week. Each handler shipping size 48 and/or 56 red seedless grapefruit during the regulation period shall complete and submit to the committee, no later than 2 p.m. of the business day following the shipment, a report of red seedless grapefruit shipments by day for each regulation week.</P>
                <P>(e) Any handler may transfer or loan any or all of their shipping allotment (excluding the overshipment allowance) of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit to any other handler. Each handler party to such transfer or loan shall no later than noon on the Wednesday following the regulation week notify the committee so the proper adjustment of records may be made. In each case, the committee shall confirm in writing all such transactions, prior to the following week, to the handlers involved. The committee may act on behalf of handlers wanting to arrange allotment loans or participate in the transfer of allotments.</P>
                <P>(f) New handlers with no record of shipments planning to ship red seedless grapefruit covered by any percentage size regulation shall register with the committee prior to the regulation period so their allotments can be properly calculated. Each new handler shall provide on a form furnished by the committee their Florida citrus fruit dealer's license number, their Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Fruit and Vegetable Division packinghouse registration number, and the physical location of the packinghouse where the red seedless grapefruit is to be prepared for market. The committee shall notify any new handlers of their allotments prior to the regulation period.</P>

                <P>(a) Each person who first handles avocados shall, with respect to the avocados so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during each fiscal year. Each such person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of avocados handled by him as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal year, and the total quantity of avocados so handled by all persons during the same fiscal year. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative. If a handler does not pay <PRTPAGE P="94"/>his assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the unpaid assessment may be subject to an interest charge at rates prescribed by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment per 55-pounds of fruit or equivalent in any container or in bulk, to be paid by each such handler. At any time during or after a fiscal year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment, in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expense which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all fruit handled during the applicable fiscal year. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, or borrow money on an emergency short-term basis. The authority of the committee to borrow money is subject to approval of the Secretary and may be used only to meet financial obligations as the obligations occur or to allow the committee to adjust its reserve funds to meet such obligations.</P>

                <P>(a) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each person entitled to a proportionate refund of the excess assessment shall be credited with such refund against the operation of the following fiscal year unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which event it shall be paid to him: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any sum paid by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal year may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal year to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.</P>

Such reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed approximately 3 fiscal years' operational expenses.

              <P>The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed in § 920.41.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As his or her pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal period, each person who first handles kiwifruit during such period shall pay to the committee, upon demand, assessments on all kiwifruit so handled. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative. If a handler does not pay any assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established by the Secretary upon recommendation of the committee.</P>

              <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which <PRTPAGE P="130"/>may be incurred: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any assessment, excluding any amount collected pursuant to § 920.55(c), must be limited to a maximum assessment rate of three and one-half cents per flat, or the equivalent thereof. The Secretary may increase this maximum rate in each succeeding year after the initial year of order operation by the Consumer Price Index (cost of living) for California as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Such increase shall be applied to all kiwifruit handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purposes.</P>

              <P>(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in accordance with one of the following:</P>

              <P>(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any sum paid by a person in excess of his or her pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.</P>

              <P>(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That funds already in the reserve do not equal approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used: (i) To defray expenses, during any fiscal period, prior to the time assessment income is insufficient to cover such expenses; (ii) to cover deficits incurred during any fiscal year when assessment income is less than expenses; (iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative; and, (iv) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>
              <P>(b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part.

              <P>(a) The manner of nominating grower members and alternate members to the committee shall be as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) The committee's mailing of an approved nomination form to all kiwifruit growers of record shall constitute notice of nominations. All eligible kiwifruit growers may nominate themselves or any other eligible kiwifruit grower to vacant committee positions for the nominee's district. Completed nomination forms shall be returned to the office of the committee by a date specified by the committee and approved by an agent of the Secretary. Nomination forms shall provide for names of nominees, as well as the <PRTPAGE P="136"/>nominating grower's name, address, telephone number, and signature. Incomplete nominations forms will not be considered valid.</P>
              <P>(2) For each district involved in the current year's nominations, committee staff, with the Secretary's oversight, shall establish a slate of candidates with the names of all qualified nominees received. Persons submitting invalid nomination forms shall be notified of such by the committee. Within a reasonable time period, a ballot containing a slate of candidates shall be mailed to all growers of record within the respective district represented by such candidates. The committee shall provide a reasonable period of time to growers to cast votes on the candidates and return the completed ballots for tallying.</P>
              <P>(3) To be eligible to vote, growers must be producing kiwifruit during the crop year nominations are held and within the district represented by the candidates on the ballot. A grower may only vote for candidates from one district and may only cast one ballot. Growers may also cast votes for eligible candidates who do not appear on the ballots by writing in the name of such candidates on the ballot. Each ballot shall provide for a voter eligibility certification which must include the voter's name, address, telephone number, and signature, as well as the name(s) of all handlers which handled the current season's crop. At the discretion of the Secretary, the ballots may include other background information about each candidate.</P>
              <P>(4) In order to be valid, ballots must be executed in accordance with the instructions set forth on the ballot, and are to be returned to the Secretary's agent who will tally the ballots with such assistance from the committee as may be requested by the agent. Such ballots shall be postmarked by a date specified by the committee and approved by an agent of the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(5) The names of the persons receiving the highest total number of votes for a particular position shall be submitted to the Secretary as the nominees for such positions. In the event of a tie vote, a ballot containing only the names of the candidates receiving the tied vote shall be mailed to all growers in the affected district.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of a vacancy as specified in § 920.26, the committee shall utilize the same procedure as prescribed in § 920.122(a)(1) through (a)(5) to fill such vacancy.</P>

              <P>(2) The quantity shall be indicated in terms of the size designation and either the net weight for volume-fill containers packed by weight or the count for volume-fill containers packed by count.</P>
              <P>(3) For bulk containers or individual consumer packages not within a master container, the quantity shall be indicated in terms of the size designation and net weight, or in terms of the size designation and count.</P>
              <P>(4) Master containers, which hold more than one individual package, must be properly marked with the quantity of the contents. The size designation must also be indicated.</P>

                <P>(a) Each person who first handles apricots shall, with respect to the apricots so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of apricots handled by him as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of apricots so handled by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all apricots handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.</P>

                <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section each person entitled to a proportionate refund of any excess assessment shall be credited with such refund against the operation of the following fiscal period unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which event it shall be paid to him: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any sum paid by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.</P>

                <P>(2) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may determine that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of the committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal period which are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during such period may be carried over into following periods as a reserve. Such reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed approximately one fiscal period's operational expenses; and such reserve may be used to cover the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event of termination of this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the maintenance and functioning of the committee during any fiscal period when there is a crop failure, or during any period of suspension of any or all of the provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by the committee to finance its operations, during any fiscal period, prior to the time that assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; but any of the reserve funds so used shall be returned to the reserve as soon as assessment income is available for this purpose. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That <PRTPAGE P="146"/>to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>

                <P>(a) Each person who first handles cherries shall, with respect to the cherries so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of cherries handled by him as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of cherries so handled by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.</P>

                <P>(c) If a handler does not pay any assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be <PRTPAGE P="158"/>subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established by USDA as recommended by the committee.</P>

Such reserve may also be used by the committee to finance its operations, during any fiscal period, prior to the time that assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; but any of the reserve funds so used shall be returned to the reserve as soon as assessment income is available for this purpose.

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Each person who first handles grapes shall pay to the committee, upon demand, such handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after a fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later findings by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all grapes handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments in the current period's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.</P>
                <P>(c) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by the committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest, and late payment charge shall be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within the prescribed time shall be subject to the interest or late payment charge, or both.</P>

                <P>(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in accordance with one of the following:</P>

                <P>(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any sum paid by a person in excess of that person's pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.</P>

                <P>(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That funds in the reserve shall not exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used: (i) To defray expenses, during any fiscal period, prior to the time the assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; (ii) to cover deficits incurred during any fiscal period when assessment income is less than expenses; (iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative; or (iv) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That to the extent practicable such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>
                <P>(b) All funds received by the committee under this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.</P>

                <P>(c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property and funds in such member's possession to the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be necessary <PRTPAGE P="170"/>or appropriate to vest in the committee full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant to this part.</P>

              <P>(iii) Such other types and sizes of containers as may be approved by the Committee for experimental or research purposes.</P>

              <P>(2) The minimum net weight of grapes in any such containers, except for containers containing grapes packed in sawdust, cork, excelsior or similar packing material, or packed in bags or wrapped in plastic or paper, and containers authorized in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, shall be 20 pounds based on the average net weight of grapes in a representative sample of containers. Grapes in any such containers packed in bags, or wrapped in plastic or paper prior to being placed in these containers shall meet a minimum net weight of 18 pounds based on the average net weight of grapes in a representative sample of containers: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That grapes packed in master containers containing individual consumer packages are exempt from container marking requirements and minimum net weight requirements. Containers of grapes other than master containers containing individual consumer packages shall be marked with the minimum net weight of 20 or 18 pounds.</P>
              <P>(3) Such containers of grapes shall be plainly marked with the minimum net weight of grapes contained therein (with numbers and letters at least one-fourth inch in height), the name of the variety of the grapes and the name of the shipper, as provided in §§ 1436.30 and 1359 of Title 3: California Code of Regulations.</P>

              <P>(4) Such containers of grapes shall be plainly marked with the lot stamp number corresponding to the lot inspection conducted by an authorized inspector, except that such requirement shall not apply to containers in the center tier of a lot palletized in a 3 box by 3 box pallet configuration: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That pallets of reusable plastic containers shall have the lot stamp number stamped on two USDA-approved pallet tags, each affixed to opposite sides of the pallet of containers, in addition to other required information on the cards of the individual containers.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Donation to charitable organizations.</E> Handlers of grapes failing to meet the requirements of § 925.55 and paragraph (a) of this section may donate such grapes to charitable organizations. Any such grapes shall not be used for resale. Handlers donating such grapes to a charitable organization shall submit a completed Food Donation Form, CDGAC Form No. 8, as required in § 925.160(c), within 2 days of receipt by the intended charity.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Organically grown grapes.</E> Organically grown grapes (defined to mean grapes which have been grown for market as natural grapes by performing all the normal cultural practices, but not using any inorganic fertilizers or agricultural chemicals including insecticides, herbicides, and growth regulators, except sulfur) need not meet the minimum individual berry size requirements of this section if the following conditions and safeguards are met: (1) <PRTPAGE P="176"/>The handler of such grapes has registered and certified with the committee on a date specified by the committee the location of the vineyard, the acreage and variety of grapes, and such other information as may be needed by the committee to carry out these provisions; (2) each container of organically grown grapes bears the words “organically grown” on one outside end of the container in plain letters in addition to requirements specified under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">By-product grapes.</E> The handling of grapes for processing (raisins, crushing and other by-products) is exempt from requirements specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section if the committee determines that the person handling such grapes has secured the appropriate permit or order from the County Agricultural Commissioner, and the by-product plant or packing plant to which the grapes are shipped has adequate facilities for commercial processing, grading, packing or manufacturing of by-products for resale.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Suspension of packing holidays.</E> Upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Secretary, the prohibition against packing or repacking grapes on any Saturday, Sunday or on Memorial Day or Independence Day holidays of each year, may be modified or suspended to permit the handling of grapes provided such handling complies with procedures and safeguards specified by the committee as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) All requests for suspension of a packing holiday shall be in writing, shall state the reasons the suspension is being requested, and shall be submitted to the Committee manager by noon on Wednesday or at least 3 days prior to the requested suspension date;</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of a written request, the Committee manager shall promptly give reasonable notice to producers and handlers and to the Secretary that an assembled Committee meeting will be held to discuss the request(s). The representative of the Secretary shall attend the meeting via speakerphone or in person, and all votes of the Committee members shall be cast in person;</P>
              <P>(3) The Committee members shall consider marketing conditions (i.e., supplies of competing commodities to include quantities in inventory, the expected demand conditions for grapes in different markets, and any pertinent documents which provide data on market conditions), weather conditions, labor shortages, the size of the crop remaining to be marketed, and other pertinent factors in reaching a decision to suspend packing holidays;</P>
              <P>(4) Once a vote is taken, any documents utilized during the meeting will be forwarded immediately to the Secretary's representative and a summary of the Committee's action and reasons for recommending approval or disapproval will be prepared and also forwarded by the committee; and</P>
              <P>(5) The Secretary's representative shall notify the Committee manager of approval or disapproval of the request prior to commencement of the suspended packing holiday and the Committee manager shall notify handlers and producers accordingly.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Expenses.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Fresh Pear Committee and the Processed Pear Committee are authorized, each independently, to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds may be necessary to carry out their functions under this subpart. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as provided in § 927.41.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 927.41</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Assessments will be levied only upon handlers who first handle pears. Each handler shall pay assessments on all pears handled by such handler as the pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee during a fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may be required under this part throughout the period such assessments are payable irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Based upon a recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for the fresh market during each fiscal period. Such base rates shall include one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as summer/fall; one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears, classified as winter; and one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as other. Upon recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates of assessment on individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within the assessment classifications in this paragraph (b)(1) to secure sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under § 927.47. At any time during the fiscal period when it is determined on the basis of a Fresh Pear Committee recommendation or other information that different rates are necessary for fresh pears or for any varieties or subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of assessment and such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or subvarieties that are shipped during the fiscal period for fresh market.</P>
                <P>(2) Based upon a recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for processing during each fiscal period. Such base rates shall include one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as summer/fall; one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears, classified as winter; and one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as other. Upon recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates of assessment on individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within the assessment classifications defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to secure sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under § 927.47. At any time during the fiscal period when it is determined on the basis of a Processed Pear Committee recommendation or other information that different rates are necessary for pears for processing or for any varieties or subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of assessment and such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears that are shipped during the fiscal period for processing.</P>
                <P>(c) Based on the recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee, the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may establish additional base rates of assessments, or change or modify the base rate classifications defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

                <P>(d) The Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may impose a late payment charge on any handler who fails to pay any assessment within the time prescribed. In the event the handler thereafter fails to pay the <PRTPAGE P="187"/>amount outstanding, including the late payment charge, within the prescribed time, the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may impose an additional charge in the form of interest on such outstanding amount. The Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe the amount of such late payment charge and rate of interest.</P>
                <P>(e) In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee prior to commencement of shipments in any season, handlers may make advance payments of assessments, which advance payments shall be credited to such handlers and the assessments of such handlers shall be adjusted so that such assessments are based upon the quantity of each variety or subvariety of pears handled by such handlers during such season. Further, payment discounts may be authorized by the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee upon the approval of the Secretary to handlers making such advance assessment payments.</P>

                <P>(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may carryover such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That funds already in the reserve do not exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve may be used to cover any expense authorized under this part and to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Any such excess not retained in a reserve or applied to any outstanding obligation of the person from whom it was collected shall be refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>
                <P>(b) All funds received pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part.

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) As a handler's pro rate share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal period, a handler shall pay to the committee assessments on all cranberries acquired as the first handler thereof during such period, except as provided in § 929.55: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no handler shall pay assessments on excess cranberries as provided in § 929.57. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler during a fiscal period in an amount designated to secure funds sufficient to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the assessment rate in order to secure funds sufficient to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cranberries acquired during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal year, before sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance and may also borrow money for such purposes.</P>
                <P>(c) If a handler does not pay such assessment within the period of time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be increased by either a late payment charge, or an interest charge, or both, at rates prescribed by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary.</P>

Such reserve funds may be used (1) to cover any expenses authorized by this part and (2) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, it shall be refunded proportionately to the handlers from whom the excess was collected. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Sales history.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A sales history for each grower shall be computed by the committee in the following manner:</P>
                <P>(1) For growers with acreage with 6 or more years of sales history, the sales history shall be computed using an average of the highest four of the most recent six years of sales.</P>

                <P>(2) For growers with 5 years of sales history from acreage planted or replanted 2 years prior to the first harvest on that acreage, the sales history is computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years.<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) For growers with 5 years of sales history from acreage planted or replanted 1 year prior to the first harvest on that acreage, the sales history is computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years and in a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) For a grower with 4 years or less of sales history, the sales history shall be computed by dividing the total sales from that acreage by 4 and in a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) For growers with acreage having no sales history, or for the first harvest of replanted acres, the sales history will be the average first year yields (depending on whether first harvested 1 or 2 years after planting or replanting) as established by the committee and multiplied by the number of acres.</P>
                <P>(6) In a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation, in addition to the sales history computed in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, additional sales history shall be assigned to growers using the formula x = (a−b)c. The letter “x” constitutes the additional number of barrels to be added to the grower's sales history. The value “a” is the expected yield for the forthcoming year harvested acreage as established by the committee. The value “b” is the total sales from that acreage as established by the committee divided by four. The value “c” is the number of acres planted or replanted in the specified year. For acreage with five years of sales history: a = the expected yield for the forthcoming sixth year harvested acreage (as established by the committee); b = an average of the most recent 4 years of expected yields (as established by the committee); and c = the number of acres with 5 years of sales history.</P>
                <P>(b) A new sales history shall be calculated for each grower after each crop year, using the formulas established in paragraph (a) of this section, or such other formula(s) as determined by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(c) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may adopt regulations to change the number and identity of years to be used in computing sales histories, including the number of years to be used in computing the average. The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and operation of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) Sales histories, starting with the crop year following adoption of this part, shall be calculated separately for fresh and processed cranberries. The amount of fresh fruit sales history may be calculated based on either the delivered weight of the barrels paid for by the handler (excluding trash and unusable fruit) or on the weight of the fruit paid for by the handler after cleaning and sorting for the retail market. Handlers using the former calculation shall allocate delivered fresh fruit subsequently used for processing to growers' processing sales. Fresh fruit sales history, in whole or in part, may be added to process fruit sales history with the approval of the committee in the event that the grower's fruit does not qualify as fresh fruit at delivery.</P>
                <P>(e) The committee may recommend rules and regulations, with the approval of the Secretary, to adjust a grower's sales history to compensate for catastrophic events that impact the grower's crop.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Marketable quantity, allotment percentage, and annual allotment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Marketable quantity and allotment percentage. If the Secretary finds, from the recommendation of the committee or from other available information, that limiting the quantity of cranberries purchased from or handled on behalf of growers during a crop year would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall determine and establish a marketable quantity for that crop year.</P>

                <P>(b) The marketable quantity shall be apportioned among growers by applying the allotment percentage to each grower's sales history, established pursuant to § 929.48. Such allotment percentage shall be established by the <PRTPAGE P="205"/>Secretary and shall equal the marketable quantity divided by the total of all growers' sales histories including the estimated total sales history for new growers. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, no handler shall purchase or handle on behalf of any grower cranberries not within such grower's annual allotment.</P>
                <P>(c) In any crop year in which the production of cranberries is estimated by the committee to be equal to or less than its recommended marketable quantity, the committee may recommend that the Secretary increase or suspend the allotment percentage applicable to that year. In the event it is found that market demand is greater than the marketable quantity previously set, the committee may recommend that the Secretary increase such quantity.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Issuance of annual allotments.</E> The committee shall require all growers to qualify for such allotment by filing with the committee a form wherein growers include the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) The amount of acreage which will be harvested;</P>
                <P>(2) A copy of any lease agreement covering cranberry acreage;</P>
                <P>(3) The name of the handler(s) to whom their annual allotment will be delivered;</P>
                <P>(4) Such other information as may be necessary for the implementation and operation of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, the committee shall issue to each grower an annual allotment determined by applying the allotment percentage established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to the grower's sales history.</P>
                <P>(f) On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, in which an allotment percentage is established by the Secretary, the committee shall notify each handler of the annual allotment that can be handled for each grower whose total crop will be delivered to that handler. In cases where a grower delivers a crop to more than one handler, the grower must specify how the annual allotment will be apportioned among the handlers. If a grower does not specify how their annual allotment is to be apportioned among the handlers, the Committee will apportion such annual allotment equally among those handlers they are delivering their crop to.</P>
                <P>(g) Growers who do not produce cranberries equal to their computed annual allotment shall transfer their unused allotment to such growers' handlers unless it is transferred to another grower in accordance with § 929.50(b) or if it is not assigned in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. The handler shall equitably allocate the unused annual allotment to growers with excess cranberries who deliver to such handler. Unused annual allotment remaining after all such transfers have occurred shall be reported and transferred to the committee by such date as established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(h) Handlers who receive cranberries more than the sum of their growers' annual allotments have “excess cranberries,” pursuant to § 929.59, and shall so notify the committee. Handlers who have remaining unused allotment pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section are “deficient” and shall so notify the committee. The committee shall allocate unused allotment to all handlers having excess cranberries, proportional to each handler's total allotment.</P>
                <P>(i) Growers who decide not to grow a crop, during any crop year in which a volume regulation is in effect, may choose not to assign their allotment to a handler.</P>
                <P>(j) The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and operation of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Withholding.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Whenever the Secretary has fixed the free and restricted percentages for any fiscal period, as provided for in § 929.52(a), each handler shall withhold from handling a portion of the cranberries acquired during such period. The withheld portion shall be equal to the restricted percentage multiplied by the volume of marketable cranberries acquired. Such withholding requirements shall not apply to any lot of cranberries for which such withholding requirement previously has been met by another handler in accordance with § 929.55.</P>
                <P>(b) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe the manner in which, and date or dates during the fiscal period by which, handlers shall have complied with the withholding requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) Withheld cranberries may meet such standards of grade, size, quality, or condition as the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may prescribe. The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service may inspect all such cranberries. A certificate of such inspection shall be issued which shall include the name and address of the handler, the number and type of containers in the lot, the location where the lot is stored, identification marks (including lot stamp, if used), and the quantity of cranberries in such lot that meet the prescribed standards. Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit to the committee a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with respect to such cranberries.</P>
                <P>(d) Any handler who withholds from handling a quantity of cranberries in excess of that required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall have such excess quantity credited toward the next fiscal year's withholding obligation, if any—provided that such credit shall be applicable only if the restricted percentage established pursuant to § 929.52 was modified pursuant to § 929.53; to the extent such excess was disposed of prior to such modification; and after such handler furnishes the committee with such information as it prescribes regarding such withholding and disposition.</P>
                <P>(e) The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) Transfer of cranberries from one handler to another may be made without prior notice to the committee, except during a period when a volume regulation has been established. If such transfer is made between handlers who have packing or processing facilities located within the production area, the assessment and withholding obligations provided under this part shall be assumed by the handler who agrees to meet such obligation.

                <SUBJECT>Special provisions relating to withheld (restricted) cranberries.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A handler shall make a written request to the committee for the release of all or part of the cranberries that the handler is withholding from handling pursuant to § 929.54(a). Each request shall state the quantity of cranberries for which release is requested and shall provide such additional information as the committee may require. Handlers may replace the quantity of withheld cranberries requested for release as provided under either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The handler may contract with another handler for an amount of free cranberries to be converted to restricted cranberries that is equal to the volume of cranberries that the handler wishes to have converted from his own restricted cranberries to free cranberries.</P>
                <P>(1) The handlers involved in such an agreement shall provide the committee with such information as may be requested prior to the release of any restricted cranberries.</P>
                <P>(2) The committee shall establish guidelines to ensure that all necessary documentation is provided to the committee, including but not limited to, the amount of cranberries being converted and the identities of the handlers assuming the responsibility for withholding and disposing of the free cranberries being converted to restricted cranberries.</P>
                <P>(3) Cranberries converted to replace released cranberries may be required to be inspected and meet such standards as may be prescribed for withheld cranberries prior to disposal.</P>
                <P>(4) Transactions and agreements negotiated between handlers shall include all costs associated with such transactions including the purchase of the free cranberries to be converted to restricted cranberries and all costs associated with inspection (if applicable) and disposal of such restricted cranberries. No costs shall be incurred by the committee other than for the normal activities associated with the implementation and operation of a volume regulation program.</P>
                <P>(5) Free cranberries belonging to one handler and converted to restricted cranberries on the behalf of another handler shall be reported to the committee in such manner as prescribed by the committee.</P>
                <P>(c) Except as otherwise directed by the Secretary, as near as practicable to the beginning of the marketing season of each fiscal period with respect to which the marketing policy proposes regulation pursuant to § 929.52(a), the committee shall determine the amount per barrel each handler shall deposit with the committee for it to release to him, in accordance with this section, all or part of the cranberries he is withholding; and the committee shall give notice of such amount of deposit to handlers. Such notice shall state the period during which such amount of deposit shall be in effect. Whenever the committee determines that, by reason of changed conditions or other factors, a different amount should therefore be deposited for the release of withheld cranberries, it shall give notice to handlers of the new amount and the effective period thereof. Each determination as to the amount of deposit shall be on the basis of the committee's evaluation of the following factors:</P>
                <P>(1) The prices at which growers are selling cranberries to handlers,</P>
                <P>(2) The prices at which handlers are selling fresh market cranberries to dealers,</P>
                <P>(3) The prices at which cranberries are being sold for processing in products,</P>
                <P>(4) The prices at which handlers are selling cranberry concentrate,</P>
                <P>(5) The prices the committee has paid to purchase cranberries to replace released cranberries in accordance with this section, and</P>

                <P>(6) The costs incurred by growers in producing cranberries.<PRTPAGE P="209"/>
                </P>
                <P>(7) Each request for release of withheld cranberries shall include, in addition to all other information as may be prescribed by the committee, the quantity of cranberries the release is requested and shall be accompanied by a deposit (a cashier's or certified check made payable to the Cranberry Marketing Committee) in an amount equal to the twenty percent of the amount determined by multiplying the number of barrels stated in the request by the then effective amount per barrel as determined in paragraph (c).</P>
                <P>(8) Subsequent deposits equal to, but not less than, the ten percent of the remaining outstanding balance shall be payable to the committee on a monthly basis commencing on January 1, and concluding by no later than August 31 of the fiscal period.</P>
                <P>(9) If the committee determines such a release request is properly filled out, is accompanied by the required deposit, and contains a certification that the handler is withholding such cranberries, it shall release to such handler the quantity of cranberries specified in his request.</P>
                <P>(d) Funds deposited for the release of withheld cranberries, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, shall be used by the committee to purchase from handlers unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries in an aggregate amount as nearly equal to, but not in excess of, the total quantity of the released cranberries as it is possible to purchase to replace the released cranberries.</P>
                <P>(e) All handlers shall be given an equal opportunity to participate in such purchase of unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries. If a larger quantity is offered than can be purchased, the purchases shall be made at the lowest price possible. If two or more handlers offer unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries at the same price, purchases from such handlers shall be in proportion to the quantity of their respective offerings insofar as such division is practicable. The committee shall dispose of cranberries purchased as restricted cranberries in accordance with § 929.57. Any funds received by the committee for cranberries so disposed of, which are in excess of the costs incurred by the committee in making such disposition, will accrue to the committee's general fund.</P>
                <P>(f) In the event any portion of the funds deposited with the committee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section cannot, for reasons beyond the committee's control, be expended to purchase unrestricted (free percentage) cranberries to replace those withheld cranberries requested to be released, such unexpended funds shall, after deducting expenses incurred by the committee, be refunded to the handler who deposited the funds. The handler shall equitably distribute such refund among the growers delivering to such handler.</P>
                <P>(g) Inspection for restricted (withheld) cranberries released to a handler is not required.</P>
                <P>(h) The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and regulations for the implementation of this section. Such rules and regulations may include, but are not limited to, revisions in the payment schedule specified in paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) of this section.</P>

Such withheld cranberries shall be defined as “excess cranberries” after all unused allotment has been allocated.</P>
                <P>(1) Excess cranberries received by a handler shall be made available for inspection by the committee or its representatives from the time they are received until final disposition is completed. Such excess cranberries shall be identified in such manner as the committee may specify in its rules and regulations with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(2) All matters dealing with handler-held excess cranberries shall be in accordance with such rules and regulations established by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(c) Prior to March 1, or such other date as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary, all excess cranberries shall be disposed of pursuant to § 929.61.</P>

              <P>The determination pursuant to § 929.54 of the quantity of screened cranberries contained in an unscreened lot shall be made in accordance with the following procedure and on the basis of a sample of representative boxes comprising no less than 2 percent of the cranberries in the lot:</P>
              <P>(a) The cranberries in the sample are cleaned to remove chaff, and the boxes of cleaned berries are weighed. The weight of the boxes themselves is then deducted to determine the weight of the cleaned berries. The weight of the cleaned berries is divided by the number of boxes in the sample to obtain the net weight of cleaned cranberries per box. The net weight is multiplied by the number of boxes in the lot to obtain the net weight of the berries in the unscreened lot.</P>
              <P>(b) The cleaned berries are run through a separator, having a <FR>9/32</FR> inch screen, and with the bounce boards in the lowest position.</P>
              <P>(c) The berries from the lower three bounce boards are rerun through the separator.</P>
              <P>(d) The berries from the upper four bounce boards are thoroughly mixed and a random cupful (approximately 1 pint) is used to determine, from a count of the sound and unsound berries, the percentage of sound berries in the lot.</P>
              <P>(e) Such percentage is adjusted by increasing it by 5 percentage points but not to exceed a total of 100 percent. (This increase makes the sample comparable to lots of screened cranberries, as such lots generally contain an average of 5 percent unsound berries.)</P>
              <P>(f) The net weight, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, of the berries in the unscreened lot, is multiplied by the adjusted percentage to obtain the quantity of screened cranberries in the unscreened lot.</P>

              <P>(b) The handler offering any lot of cranberries for inspection shall furnish the necessary labor and pay the costs of moving, weighing, and otherwise making available the sample the inspector chooses for inspection. The size of the sample shall be determined by the inspector. In the case of inspection of a lot of unscreened cranberries, the sample shall be screened by the handler under the supervision of the inspector and the inspection certificate shall show the quantity of cranberries in such lot which meets the requirements established for withheld cranberries pursuant to § 929.54(c).</P>

              <P>A sales history for each grower shall be computed by the Committee in the following manner when a producer allotment volume regulation is in effect.</P>
              <P>(a) For each grower with acreage with 6 or more years of sales history, a new sales history shall be computed using an average of the highest 4 of the most recent 6 years of sales. If the grower has acreage with 5 years of sales history and such acreage was planted more than 6 years ago, a new sales history shall be computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years.</P>
              <P>(b) For growers whose acreage has 5 years of sales history and was planted 6 years ago or later, the sales history shall be computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d). For growers whose acreage has 4 years of sales history, the sales history shall be computed by averaging all 4 years and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d). For growers whose acreage has 1 to 3 years of sales history, the sales history shall be computed by dividing the total years sales by 4 and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(c) For growers with acreage with no sales history or for the first harvest of re-planted acres, the sales history will be 75 barrels per acre for acres planted or re-planted 1 year ago and first harvested in the current crop year and 156 barrels per acre for acres planted or re-planted 2 years ago and first harvested in the current crop year.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the sales history computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, additional sales history shall be assigned to growers with acreage planted in the last 6 years. The additional sales histories depending on the date the acreage is planted are shown in Table 1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Handler diversion.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Methods of diversion.</E> Handlers may divert cranberries by disposing of cranberries or cranberry products. Diversion by disposal may take place prior to placing the cranberries into the processing line or after processing. Handlers may also divert cranberries or cranberry products to approved, noncompetitive outlets for withheld fruit. Whole berries or processed products diverted must come from the current crop year. Any information collected of a confidential and/or proprietary nature would be held in confidence pursuant to § 929.65.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Diversion through disposal.</E> This type of diversion is to be carried out under the supervision of the Committee, and the cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Handlers shall notify the Committee of their intent to dispose of cranberries or cranberry products using Form CMC-DISP as specified in § 929.162(c). Following notification, a Committee inspector will meet with the handler to verify the documentation provided and, when possible, witness the destruction. The Committee inspector may request receipts, visual proof, or any other information needed to support the disposal as reported. Once the verification process has been completed, the Committee inspector will sign the certification section of Form CMC-DISP and return it to the Committee.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Diversion through noncompetitive outlets.</E> To divert cranberries or cranberry products to a noncompetitive outlet, handlers must apply to the Committee using Form CMC-OUT as specified in § 929.162(d) prior to each disposal activity of this type. The Committee will review the information and approve or disapprove the diversion request. Once the cranberries or cranberry products are delivered to the approved noncompetitive outlets, the Committee must receive satisfactory documentation of the transaction using Form CMC-CONF as specified in § 929.162(e).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Committee notification and handler plan.</E> Any handler intending to divert cranberries or cranberry products pursuant to § 929.54 must notify the Committee of such intent and provide a plan by June 1 that shows how the handler intends to meet the restricted percentage obligation. The handler shall submit this plan using Form CMC-JUNE as specified in the reporting requirements under § 929.162(a). The handler will have until August 31 to fulfill the plan, by which time the handler shall submit a final report detailing how the restricted percentage obligation was met using Form CMC-AUG as specified in § 929.162(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> (1) If a handler is dissatisfied with a determination made by the Committee which affects such handler, the handler may submit to the Committee within 30 days after receipt of the Committee's determination, a request for a review by an appeals subcommittee composed of two independent growers and two cooperative representatives, as well as a public member. The appeals subcommittee shall be appointed by the Committee chairperson. The handler may forward with the request any pertinent materials for consideration of the appeal.</P>
              <P>(2) The subcommittee shall review the information submitted by the handler and render a decision within 30 days of receipt of such appeal. The subcommittee shall notify the handler of its decision, accompanied by the reasons for its conclusions and findings.</P>
              <P>(3) The handler may further appeal to the Secretary, within 15 days after notification of the subcommittee's findings, if such handler is not satisfied with the appeals subcommittee's decision. The Committee shall forward a file to the Secretary with all pertinent information related to the handler's appeal. The Secretary shall inform the handler and all interested parties of the Secretary's decision. All decisions by the Secretary are final.</P>

                <P>(3) Only growers, including duly authorized officers or employees of growers, who are eligible to serve as grower members of the Board shall participate in the nomination of grower members and alternate grower members of the Board. No grower shall participate in the submission of nominees in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a grower produces cherries in more than one district, that grower may select in which district he or she wishes to participate in the nominations and election process and shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection. A grower may not participate in the nomination process in one district and the election process in a second district in the same election cycle.</P>
                <P>(4) Only handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees of handlers, who are eligible to serve as handler members of the Board shall participate in the nomination of handler members and alternate handler members of the Board. No handler shall participate in the selection of nominees in more than one district during any fiscal period.

A handler may not participate in the nominations process in one district and the elections process in a second district in the same election cycle. If a person is a grower and a grower-handler only because some or all of his or her cherries were custom packed, but he or she does not own or lease and operate a processing facility, such person may vote only as a grower.</P>
                <P>(5) In districts entitled to only one Board member, both growers and handlers may be nominated for the district's Board seat. Grower and handler nominations must follow the petition procedures outlined in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) All eligible growers and handlers in all districts may submit the names of the nominees for the public member and alternate public member of the Board.</P>
                <P>(7) After the appointment of the initial Board, the Secretary or the Board shall announce at least 180 days in advance when a Board member's term is expiring and shall solicit nominations for that position in the manner described in this section. Nominations for such position should be submitted to the Secretary or the Board not less than 120 days prior to the expiration of such term.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Election.</E> (1) After receiving nominations, the Secretary or the Board shall distribute ballots via the U.S. Postal Service or other means, as determined by the Secretary, to all eligible growers and handlers containing the names of the nominees by district for the respective seats on the Board, excluding the public voting member seat. The ballots will clearly indicate that growers and handlers may only rank or otherwise vote for nominees in their own district.<PRTPAGE P="227"/>

No grower shall participate in the election of Board members in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a grower produces cherries in more than one district, the grower must vote in the same district in which he or she chose to participate in the nominations process under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. However, if the grower did not participate in the nominations process, he or she may select in which district he or she wishes to vote and shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, only handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees of handlers, who are eligible to serve as handler members of the Board shall participate in the election of handler members and alternate handler members of the Board. No handler shall participate in the election of Board members in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a handler does handle cherries in more than one district, he or she must vote in the same district in which the handler elected to participate in the nominations process under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. However, if a handler did not participate in the nominations process, that handler may select in which district he or she chooses to vote and shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection. If a person is a grower and a grower-handler only because some or all of his or her cherries were custom packed, but he or she does not own or lease and operate a processing facility, such person may vote only as a grower.</P>

                <P>(ii) To be seated as a handler representative in any district, the successful candidate must receive the support of handler(s) that handled a combined total of no less than five percent (5%), of the average production, as that term is used in § 930.20, handled in the district; <E T="03">Provided,</E> that this paragraph shall not apply if its application would result in a sales constituency conflict as provided in § 930.20(g).</P>
                <P>(4) In districts entitled to only one Board member, growers and handlers may vote for either the grower or handler nominee(s) for the single seat allocated to those districts.</P>
                <P>(d) The members of the Board appointed by the Secretary pursuant to § 930.24 shall, at the first meeting and whenever necessary thereafter, by at least a two-thirds vote of the entire Board, select individuals to serve as the public member and alternate public member of the Board from the list of nominees received from growers and handlers pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or from other persons nominated by the Board. The persons selected shall be subject to appointment by the Secretary under § 930.24.</P>

                <P>The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred for its maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as provided in § 930.41.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An assessment may be levied upon handlers annually under this part to cover the administrative costs of the Board, costs of inspection, and any research, development and promotion activities initiated by the Board under § 930.48.</P>
                <P>(b) Each part of an assessment intended to cover the costs of each activity in paragraph (a) of this section, must be identified and approved by the Board and the Secretary, and any notification or other statement regarding assessments provided to handlers must contain such information.</P>

                <P>(c) As a pro rata share of the administrative, inspection, research, development, and promotion expenses which the Secretary finds reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Board during a fiscal period, each handler shall pay to the Board assessments on all cherries handled, as the handler thereof, during such period: <E T="03">Provided,</E> a handler shall be exempt from any assessment only on the tonnage of handled cherries that either are diverted by destruction at the handler's facilities according to § 930.59 or are cherries represented by grower diversion certificates issued pursuant to § 930.58(b) and acquired by handlers as described in § 930.59.</P>

                <P>(d) The Secretary, after consideration of the recommendation of the Board, shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler during the fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be approved and incurred during such period or subsequent period as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="231"/>may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the Board may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may borrow money for such purposes.</P>

                <P>(e) Assessments not paid within a time prescribed by the Board may be made subject to interest or late payment charges, or both. The period of time, rate of interest, and late payment charge will be as recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That when interest or late payment charges are in effect, they shall be applied to all assessments not paid within the prescribed period of time.</P>
                <P>(f) Assessments shall be calculated on the basis of pounds of cherries handled. The established assessment rate may be uniform, or may vary dependent on the product the cherries are used to manufacture. In recommending annual assessment rates, the Board shall consider:</P>
                <P>(1) The differences in the number of pounds of cherries utilized for various cherry products; and</P>
                <P>(2) The relative market values of such cherry products.</P>
                <P>(g) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over all or any portion of such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve. Such reserve funds may be used to cover any expenses authorized by this part, and to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, it shall be refunded proportionately to the handlers from whom the excess was collected. Without an additional reserve level approved by the Secretary, the amount held in reserve may not exceed approximately one year's operational expenses. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such a manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That to the extent practicable, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>
                <P>(b) All funds received by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection and certification.</E> Whenever the handling of any cherries requires inspection pursuant to this part, each handler who handles cherries shall cause such cherries to be inspected by the appropriate division of USDA, and certified by it as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulation: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That inspection and certification shall be required for cherries which previously have been so <PRTPAGE P="232"/>inspected and certified only if such cherries have been regraded, resorted, repackaged, or in any other way further prepared for market.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Optimum supply.</E> On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board shall hold a meeting to review sales data, inventory data, current crop forecasts and market conditions in order to establish an optimum supply level for the crop year. The optimum supply volume shall be calculated as 100 percent of the average sales of the prior three years reduced by average sales that represent dispositions of exempt cherries and restricted percentage cherries qualifying for diversion credit for the same three years, unless the Board determines that it is necessary to recommend otherwise with respect to sales of exempt and restricted percentage cherries, to which shall be added a desirable carry-out inventory not to exceed 20 million pounds or such other amount as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. This optimum supply volume shall be announced by the Board in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Preliminary percentages.</E> On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board shall establish a preliminary free market tonnage percentage which shall be calculated as follows: from the optimum supply computed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall deduct the carry-in inventory to determine the tonnage requirements (adjusted to a raw fruit equivalent) for the current crop year which will be subtracted from the current year USDA crop forecast or by an average of such other crop estimates the Board votes to use. If the resulting number is positive, this would represent the estimated overproduction which would be the restricted tonnage. This restricted tonnage would then be divided by the sum of the crop forecast(s) for the regulated districts to obtain a preliminary restricted percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, for the regulated districts. If subtracting the current crop year requirement, computed in the first sentence from the current crop forecast, results in a negative number, the Board shall establish a preliminary free market tonnage percentage of 100 percent with a preliminary restricted percentage of zero. The Board shall announce these preliminary percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim percentages.</E> Between July 1 and September 15 of each crop year, the Board may modify the preliminary free market tonnage and restricted percentages to adjust to the actual pack occurring in the industry. The Board shall announce any interim percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Final percentages.</E> No later than September 15 of each crop year, the Board shall review the most current information available including, but not limited to, processed production and grower diversions of cherries during the current crop year. The Board shall make such adjustments as are necessary between free and restricted tonnage to achieve the optimum supply and recommend such final free market tonnage and restricted percentages to the Secretary and announce them in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The difference between any final free market tonnage percentage designated by the Secretary and 100 percent shall be the final restricted <PRTPAGE P="233"/>percentage. With its recommendation, the Board shall report on its consideration of the factors in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Factors.</E> When computing preliminary and interim percentages, or determining final percentages for recommendation to the Secretary, the Board shall give consideration to the following factors:</P>
                <P>(1) The estimated total production of cherries;</P>
                <P>(2) The estimated size of the crop to be handled;</P>
                <P>(3) The expected general quality of such cherry production;</P>
                <P>(4) The expected carryover as of July 1 of canned and frozen cherries and other cherry products;</P>
                <P>(5) The expected demand conditions for cherries in different market segments;</P>
                <P>(6) Supplies of competing commodities;</P>
                <P>(7) An analysis of economic factors having a bearing on the marketing of cherries;</P>
                <P>(8) The estimated tonnage held by handlers in primary or secondary inventory reserves;</P>
                <P>(9) Any estimated release of primary or secondary inventory reserve cherries during the crop year; and</P>
                <P>(10) The quantity of grower-diverted cherries during the crop year.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Modification.</E> In the event the Board subsequently deems it advisable to modify its marketing policy, because of national emergency, crop failure, or other major change in economic conditions, it shall hold a meeting for that purpose, and file a report thereof with the Secretary within 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) after the holding of such meeting, which report shall show the Board's recommended modification and the basis therefor.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Additional tonnage to sell as free tonnage.</E> In addition, the Board, in years when restricted percentages are established, shall make available tonnage equivalent to an additional 10 percent, if available, of the average sales of the prior 3 years, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, for market expansion.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Publicity.</E> The Board shall promptly give reasonable publicity to growers and handlers of each meeting to consider a marketing policy or any modification thereof, and each such meeting shall be open to them and to the public. Similar publicity shall be given to growers and handlers of each marketing policy report or modification thereof, filed with the Secretary and of the Secretary's action thereon. Copies of all marketing policy reports shall be maintained in the office of the Board, where they shall be made available for examination. The Board shall notify handlers, and give reasonable publicity to growers, of its computation of the optimum supply, preliminary percentages, and interim percentages and shall notify handlers of the Secretary's action on final percentages by registered or certified mail.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Restricted percentages.</E> Restricted percentage requirements established under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section may be fulfilled by handlers by either establishing an inventory reserve in accordance with § 930.55 or § 930.57 or by diversion of product in accordance with § 930.59. In years where required, the Board shall establish a maximum percentage of the restricted quantity which may be established as a primary inventory reserve such that the total primary inventory reserve does not exceed 50-million pounds; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such 50-million-pound quantity may be changed upon recommendation of the Board and approval of the Secretary. Any such change shall be recommended by the Board on or before September 30 of any crop year to become effective for the following crop year, and the quantity may be changed no more than one time per crop year. Handlers will be permitted to divert (at plant or with grower diversion certificates) as much of the restricted percentage requirement as they deem appropriate, but may not establish a primary inventory reserve in excess of the percentage established by the Board for restricted cherries. In the event handlers wish to establish inventory reserve in excess of this amount, they may do so, in which case it will be classified as a secondary inventory reserve and will be regulated accordingly.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Inventory Reserve Release.</E> In years when inventory reserve cherries are <PRTPAGE P="234"/>available and when the expected availability of cherries from the current crop plus expected carryin inventory does not fulfill the optimum supply, the Board shall release not later than November 1st of the current crop year such volume from the inventory reserve as will satisfy the optimum supply.</P>
                <P>(k) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.</P>

Such regulation designating such percentage shall fix the free market tonnage and restricted percentages, totaling 100 percent, which shall be applied in accordance with this section, §§ 930.55, 930.57 and 930.59 to cherries grown in regulated districts, as determined under § 930.52, and handled during such fiscal period.</P>
                <P>(b) The Board shall be informed immediately of any such regulation issued by the Secretary, and the Board shall promptly give notice thereof to handlers.</P>
                <P>(c) That portion of a handler's cherries that are restricted percentage cherries is the product of the restricted percentage imposed under paragraph (a) of this section multiplied by the tonnage of cherries, originating in a regulated district, handled, including those diverted according to § 930.59, by that handler in that fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(d) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall develop rules and regulations which shall provide guidelines for handlers in complying with any restricted tonnage requirements, including, but not limited to, a grace period of at least 30 days to segregate and appropriately document any tonnage they wish to place in the inventory reserve and to assemble any applicable diversion certificates.</P>

                <P>(a) Whenever the Secretary has fixed the free market tonnage and restricted percentages for any fiscal period, as provided for in § 930.51(a), each handler in a regulated district shall place in his or her primary inventory reserve for such period, at such time, and in such manner, as the Board may prescribe, or otherwise divert, according to § 930.59, a portion of the cherries acquired during such period.</P>

                <P>(b) The form of the cherries, frozen, canned in any form, dried, or concentrated juice, placed in the primary inventory reserve is at the option of the handler. The product(s) placed by the handler in the primary inventory reserve must have been produced in either the current or the preceding two crop years. Except as may be limited by § 930.50(i) or as may be permitted pursuant to §§ 930.59 and 930.62, such inventory reserve portion shall be equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the weight or volume of the cherries in each lot of cherries acquired during the fiscal period by the then effective restricted percentage fixed by the Secretary; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in converting cherries in each lot to the form chosen by the handler, the inventory reserve obligations shall be adjusted in accordance with uniform rules adopted by the Board in terms of raw fruit equivalent.</P>

                <P>(c) Inventory reserve cherries shall meet such standards of grade, quality, or condition as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. All such cherries shall be inspected by USDA. A certificate of such inspection shall be issued which shall show, among other things, the name and address of the handler, the number and type of containers in the lot, the grade of the product, the location where the lot is stored, identification marks (can codes or lot stamp), and a certification that the cherries meet the prescribed standards. Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Board, at the place designated by the Board, a copy of the certificate <PRTPAGE P="236"/>of inspection issued with respect to such cherries.</P>
                <P>(d) Handlers shall be compensated for inspection costs incurred on cherries placed in the primary inventory reserve. All reporting of cherries placed in, rotated in and out, or released from an inventory reserve shall be in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Board, with the approval of the Secretary. The Board could, with the approval of the Secretary, also limit the number of inspections of reserve cherries being rotated into inventory reserves for which the Board would be financially liable.</P>
                <P>(e) Except as provided in § 930.54, handlers may not sell inventory reserve cherries prior to their official release by the Board. Handlers may rotate cherries in their inventory reserves with prior notification to the Board. All cherries rotated into the inventory reserve must meet the applicable inspection requirements.</P>

                <P>(a) In the event the inventory reserve established under § 930.55 of this part is at its maximum volume, and the Board has announced, in accordance with § 930.50, that volume regulation will be necessary to maintain an orderly supply of quality cherries for the market, handlers in a regulated district may elect to place in a secondary inventory reserve all or a portion of the cherries the volume regulation would otherwise require them to divert in accordance with § 930.59.</P>
                <P>(b) Should any handler in a regulated district exercise his or her right to establish a secondary inventory reserve under paragraph (a) of this section, all costs of maintaining that reserve, as well as inspection costs, will be the responsibility of the individual handler.</P>
                <P>(c) The secondary inventory reserve shall be established in accordance with §§ 930.55 (b) and (c) and such other rules and regulations which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish.</P>
                <P>(d) The Board shall retain control over the release of any cherries from the secondary inventory reserve. No cherries may be released from the secondary reserve until all cherries in any primary inventory reserve established under § 930.55 have been released. Any release of the secondary inventory reserve shall be in accordance with the annual marketing policy and with § 930.54.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any grower may voluntarily elect to divert, in accordance with the provisions of this section, all or a portion of the cherries which otherwise, upon delivery to a handler, would become restricted percentage cherries. Upon such diversion and compliance with the provisions of this section, the Board shall issue to the diverting grower a grower diversion certificate which such grower may deliver to a handler. Any grower diversions completed in accordance with this section, but which are undertaken in districts subsequently exempted by the Board from volume regulation under § 930.52(d), shall qualify for diversion credit.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible diversion.</E> Grower diversion certificates shall be issued to growers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Diversion may take such of the following forms which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may designate: uses exempt under § 930.62; nonhuman food uses; or other uses, including diversion by leaving such cherries unharvested.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Application/mapping.</E> The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall develop rules and regulations providing for the diversion of cherries by growers. Such regulations may include, among other things:<PRTPAGE P="237"/>

After the diversion has been accomplished, the Board shall issue to the diverting grower a diversion certificate stating the weight of cherries diverted. Where diversion is carried out by leaving the cherries unharvested, the Board shall estimate the weight of cherries diverted on the basis of such uniform rule prescribed in rules and regulations as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may recommend to implement this section.</P>

Upon voluntary diversion and compliance with the provisions of this section, the Board shall issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate which shall satisfy any restricted percentage or diversion requirement to the extent of the Board or Department inspected weight of the cherries diverted.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible diversion.</E> Handler diversion certificates shall be issued to handlers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Such diversion may take place in any form which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may designate. Tart cherry juice and juice concentrate may receive diversion credit but only if diverted in forms approved under the terms of this section. Such forms may include, but are not limited to:</P>

Such notification shall describe in detail the manner in which the handler proposes to divert cherries including, if the diversion is to be by means of destruction of the cherries, a detailed description of the means of destruction and ultimate disposition of the cherries. It shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Uniform fees for such supervision may be established by the Board, pursuant to rules and regulations approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Diversion certificate.</E> The Board shall conduct such supervision of the handler's diversion of cherries under paragraph (c) of this section as may be necessary to assure that the cherries are diverted as authorized. After the diversion has been completed, the Board shall issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate indicating the weight of cherries which may be used to offset any restricted percentage requirement.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Transfer of certificates.</E> Within such restrictions as may be prescribed in rules and regulations, including but not limited to procedures for transfer of diversion credit and limitations on the type of certification eligible for transfer, a handler who acquires diversion certificates representing diverted cherries during any crop year may transfer such certificates to another handler or handlers. The Board must be notified in writing whenever such transfers take place during a crop year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Grower diversion certificates.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Board may, for the 1997 crop year, issue diversion certificates to growers, in districts subject to volume regulation (Northwest Michigan, Central Michigan, New York, and Utah) who have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of their 1997 tart cherry production which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> To be eligible to receive diversion credit, growers voluntarily choosing to divert cherries must meet the following terms and conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) In order to receive a certificate, a grower must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Board, that rows or trees which were selected for diversion were not harvested. Trees six years old or younger do not qualify for diversion.</P>
                <P>(2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate. The Board will confirm the grower's production amount with information provided by handlers (to which the grower delivers cherries) on Board Form Number Two.</P>
                <P>(3) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken place.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculation of diversion amounts.</E> The weight of cherries diverted and left unharvested shall be calculated by the Board after growers furnish the Board with the necessary information concerning their production. After verification of the volume of cherries diverted, the Board shall calculate the amounts of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificates and issue such certificates to growers. Such amounts shall be determined as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For whole block diversion, the weight of a harvested sample of 5 percent of each diverted block, provided by the grower, will be used to calculate the total volume of diverted cherries to be credited on the diversion certificate. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and elects to whole block divert a 200 acre block. If 5 percent of the harvested trees in the block diverted yield 80,000 pounds of cherries, the grower would receive a diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds (80,000 pounds divided by 5 percent (.05) yields 1,600,000 pounds). The rest of the block would remain unharvested.</P>

                <P>(2) For random row diversion, such estimated volume would be calculated by applying the percentage of the grower's production diverted to the actual average volume per acre of cherries produced and harvested. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and <PRTPAGE P="242"/>elects to divert 20 percent of the harvestable acreage (200 acres). The grower harvests the remaining 800 acres and obtains 6,400,000 pounds of cherries, which represents a yield per acre of 8,000 pounds. Such grower would receive a diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds of cherries (8,000 lbs multiplied by the 20 percent of the total acreage diverted; in this instance, 200 acres).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Grower diversion and grower diversion certificates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Grower diversion certificates.</E> The Board may issue diversion certificates <PRTPAGE P="243"/>to growers in districts subject to volume regulation who have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of their tart cherry production which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries. Handlers may redeem diversion certificates with the Board through June 30 of each crop year. After June 30 of the crop year that crop year's grower diversion certificates are no longer valid. Cherries that have reached a harvestable, marketable condition will be eligible for diversion. Diversion will not be granted to growers whose fruit was destroyed before it set and/or matured on the tree, or whose fruit is unmarketable. If marketable fruit were to be damaged or destroyed by acts of nature such as storms or hail diversion credit could be granted. To be considered marketable for the purposes of this section, sampled fruit may not exceed a 5 percent tolerance for insects or a 7 percent tolerance for rot.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application and mapping for diversion.</E> Any grower desiring to divert cherries using methods other than in-orchard tank shall submit a map of the orchard or orchards to be diverted, along with a completed Grower Diversion Application, to the Board by April 15 of each crop year. The application includes a statement which must be signed by the grower which states that the grower agrees to comply with the regulations established for a tart cherry diversion program. Each map shall contain the grower's name and number assigned by the Board, the grower's address, block name or number when appropriate, location of orchard or orchards and other information which may be necessary to accomplish the desired diversion. On or before July 1, the grower should inform the Board of such grower's intention to divert in-orchard and what type of diversion will be used. The four types of diversion are random row diversion, whole block diversion, partial block diversion and in-orchard tank diversion. A grower who informs the Board about the type of diversion he or she wishes to use by July 1 can elect to use any diversion method or combination of diversion methods. Only random row or in-orchard tank diversion methods may be used if the Board is not so informed by July 1. Trees that are four years or younger do not qualify for diversion. Annual resubmissions of either the map or application will no longer be required. Growers will only submit a new application and map if they are participating in the grower diversion program for the first time. Growers will need only to submit a new orchard map if he/she adds a new block of trees to the orchard or changes the orchard layout differently from the map previously submitted to the Board.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Random row diversion.</E> Using the orchard map furnished by the grower, the Board will randomly select rows of trees within the orchard to be diverted. The amount of cherries to be diverted will be based on the preliminary restricted percentage amount established pursuant to § 930.50. A grower may elect a different percentage amount; however, the grower needs to inform the Board as soon as possible after the preliminary percentages are announced of this other amount, but in no event shall this be less than seven days in advance of harvest. The designated rows indicated by the map must not be harvested. After completing harvest of the remaining rows in the orchard, the grower must notify the Board and/or the Board's compliance officer. A compliance officer will then be allowed to observe the grower's orchard to assure that the selected rows have not been harvested. The grower must inform the Board of the total production of the orchard to calculate the tonnage that was diverted.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Whole block diversion.</E> Based on maps supplied by the grower, a sampling procedure will be used to determine the amount of cherries in the orchard to be diverted. A block is defined as rows that run in the same direction, are similar in age, and have definable boundaries. The Board will require a number of tree sites to be sampled depending on the size of the block. A tree site is a planted tree or an area where a tree was planted and may have been uprooted or died. If a block has 5 rows or less, or 200 or less tree sites, 3 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled, if a block has 6 to 15 rows, or 201-<PRTPAGE P="244"/>400 tree sites, 4 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled, and if a block has 16 or more rows and greater than 400 tree sites, 5 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled. The Board's compliance officer will apply the sampling procedure (based on the number of rows or the number of tree sites) which results in the fewest number of tree sites required to be sampled. From each of the rows to be sampled, ten contiguous tree sites will be sampled. Only trees more than five years old will be harvested for the sample. For example, if it is determined that five rows are to be sampled, 10 contiguous tree sites in each of the five rows will be subject to harvest. Trees within the 10 sites which are more than five years old will be harvested. The harvested tonnage will be converted to a volume that represents the entire block of cherries. If, for example, a total of 4,600 pounds is harvested from the sample tree sites and this total is divided by 50 tree sites a yield of 92 pounds per tree site is obtained. To find the total yield for the block, the 92 pounds per tree site yield is multiplied by the 880 tree sites that were mapped in the block and that equals 80,960 pounds for that block. The compliance officer would be allowed access to the block to oversee the sampling process and to confirm that the block has been diverted.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Partial block diversion.</E> Partial block diversion will also be accomplished using maps supplied by the grower. Sampling will be done as in whole block diversion except that only partial blocks would be selected and sampled. Growers may divert up to five partial blocks, or 50 percent of a grower's total number of blocks per year. Such block(s) must be mapped and will be sampled as described under whole block diversion. Rows used in partial block diversion must be contiguous.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">In-orchard tank diversion.</E> Growers wishing to in-orchard tank divert must pick the cherries to be diverted and place them in harvesting tanks. A compliance officer would then probe the tanks for volume measurement and observe the destruction of the cherries on the grower's premises. Growers wishing to take advantage of this option must have at least 10 tanks ready for diversion. The compliance officer has up to five days to come to the grower's premises to observe the diversion after being contacted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> Growers who voluntarily participate in the grower diversion program must sign and file with the Board a Grower Diversion Application. By signing the application, a grower agrees to the terms and conditions of the grower diversion program as contained in these regulations. To be eligible to receive diversion credit, growers voluntarily choosing to divert cherries must meet the following terms and conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) In order to receive a certificate, a grower must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Board, that rows or trees which were selected for diversion were not harvested. Trees four years old or younger do not qualify for diversion.</P>
              <P>(2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate. The Board will confirm the grower's production amount with information provided by handlers (to which the grower delivers cherries) on Board form Number Two.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken place. If the terms and conditions for whole block, partial block or in-orchard tank diversion are not completed, the Board shall not issue the grower a diversion certificate.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a grower who chooses random row diversion harvests rows that were designated not to be harvested, the grower should inform the Board immediately of the error. The grower will then be required to divert twice the amount (rows or trees) incorrectly harvested to correct the mistake. The grower will still receive a diversion certificate equal to the original requested amount. However, in instances where a grower is at the end of harvesting the orchard and fails to divert a complete block or specified rows, the Board shall multiply by two the difference between the original diversion amount and the actual diverted amount. The Board shall subtract that <PRTPAGE P="245"/>amount from the diversion application amount. Thus, the grower would receive a grower diversion certificate equal to a portion of the originally requested amount. If the grower does not inform the Board of such errors, the grower will not receive a diversion certificate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Handler diversion.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Methods of diversion.</E> Handlers may divert cherries by redeeming grower diversion certificates, by destroying cherries at handlers' facilities (at-plant), by diverting cherry products accidentally or voluntarily destroyed, by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable organizations or by using cherries or cherry products for exempt purposes under § 930.162, including export to countries other than Canada, and Mexico. Once diversion has taken place, handlers will receive diversion certificates stating the weight of cherries diverted. Diversion credit may be used to fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in part. Any information of a confidential and/or proprietary nature included in this application would be held in confidence pursuant to § 930.73 of the order.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Board notification and handler plan.</E> Any handler intending to divert cherries or cherry products pursuant to § 930.59 of the order (except through exempt uses under § 930.62 of the order) must notify the Board of such intent and provide a plan by October 1 which shows how the handler intends to meet the restricted percentage obligation, except that, for the 1997-98 season only, the deadline is February 5, 1998. The Board may extend this date in individual cases pursuant to a written request showing good cause why the plan cannot be provided by the due date. A handler will have one year to fulfill such plan. The details of the plan shall include, but not be limited to, the name and address of the handler, the total product processed at-plant, product diverted at-plant, in-orchard diversion certificates to be redeemed, anticipated donations to charitable outlets, disposition to exempt outlets or uses and detailed plans for how and where such disposition will be made, and inventory reserve amount. It shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Supervision of diversion by means other than destruction of the cherries at a handler's facility will be subject to supervision as found necessary by the Board. USDA inspectors or Board employees will supervise diversion of cherry products at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 52.42). Any cherries not diverted in accordance with the handler's plan will be placed into the secondary inventory reserve or the primary inventory reserve if a secondary inventory reserve has not been established.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">At-plant diversion.</E> Diversion by disposal at-plant may take place prior to placing the cherries into the processing line, or after processing, but before a finished product is manufactured. Such diversion will take place under the supervision of USDA Inspection Service or Board employee inspectors. USDA inspectors or Board employees or Board agents will supervise diversion of cherry products at-plant at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 52.42).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Diversion of finished products.</E> Handlers may be granted diversion credit for finished tart cherry products that are accidentally destroyed or voluntarily destroyed by the handler. To receive diversion credit under this option the cherry products must be owned by the handler at the time of accidental or voluntary destruction, be a marketable product at the time of processing, be included in the handler's end of the year handler plan, and have been assigned a Raw Product Equivalent (RPE) by the handler to determine the volume of cherries. In addition, the accidental or voluntary destruction and disposition of the product must be verified by either a USDA inspector or Board agent or employee who witnesses the disposition of the accidentally or <PRTPAGE P="246"/>voluntarily destroyed product. Products will be considered as accidentally destroyed if they sustain damage which renders them unacceptable in normal market channels. Products which are voluntarily destroyed must have deteriorated in condition to such an extent that they are not acceptable for use in normal market channels.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Contributions to approved charitable organizations.</E> When diverting by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable organizations, handlers should follow the requirements specified herein. For contributions to qualify for diversion credit, the contributed product should be marked clearly “NOT FOR RESALE”. The receiving organization must be approved by the Board as a qualified recipient of contributions of tart cherry products. Such organizations must be tax-exempt, must not sell the donated products and must be noncompetitive with other tart cherry industry sales outlets. Once products are donated to an organization, the Board must receive satisfactory documentation of the transaction. Handlers should provide the Board with information on how the product was used and the volume of product used.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Grower diversion certificates.</E> To satisfy restricted percentage obligations by redeeming grower diversion certificates handlers must present to the Board grower diversion certificates obtained from growers who have diverted cherries by non-harvest, and who have been issued diversion certificates by the Board in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations governing the issuance of grower diversion certificates. For this crop year July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, grower diversion certificates will be valid until February 5, 1998.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Tart cherries which are used for the purpose of new product development, for new market development and market expansion, for the development of export markets, for experimental purposes, for export to countries other than Canada, and Mexico, or which are donated to charitable organizations may be granted an exemption by the Board and will be exempt from §§ 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and §§ 930.55 through 930.57, subject to the following terms and conditions. Any information received of a confidential and/or proprietary nature included in this application will be protected from disclosure pursuant to § 930.73 of the order.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms in paragraph (a) of this section shall have the following meaning:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">New product development.</E> This term includes the development of new tart cherry products or of foods or other products in which tart cherries or tart cherry products are incorporated which are not presently being produced on a commercial basis. New product development can also include the production or processing of a tart cherry product using a technique not presently being utilized commercially in the tart cherry industry; an end product of the processing of raw tart cherries done by the industry at pack time either for resale or for re-manufacturing which has not been manufactured previously by the industry; or a processed, value-added item that includes tart cherry products as an ingredient which has never been marketed to consumers either by a handler within the industry or by a food manufacturer. In addition, the maximum duration of any credit activity is five years from the date of the first shipment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">New market development and market expansion.</E> This includes the development of markets for tart cherry products which are not commercially established markets and which are not competitive with commercial outlets presently utilized by the tart cherry industry (including the development of new export markets): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That these markets are a geographic area into which tart cherries or products derived from them have not been previously sold. The term “market expansion”, includes activities that incrementally expand the sale of either tart cherries or the products in which tart cherries are an ingredient, such as, but not limited to: Expansions of the geographic areas into which tart cherries or tart <PRTPAGE P="247"/>cherry products are marketed; product line extensions; significant improvements to or revisions of existing products; packaging innovations; segmentation of markets along geographic, demographic, or other definable characteristics; and product repositionings. In addition, shipments of tart cherries or tart cherry products in new market development and market expansion outlets are eligible for handler diversion credit for a period of five years from the handler's date of the first shipment into such outlets.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Development of export markets.</E> The sale of cherries or cherry products, including the development of sales for new or different tart cherry products or the expansion of sales for existing tart cherry products, to countries other than Canada, and Mexico.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Experimental purposes.</E> The use of cherries or cherry products in preliminary and/or developmental activities intended to result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration and volume based on information supplied by the applicant at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case shall an individual exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent of tart cherries.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Obtaining approval for exempt uses.</E> In order to receive exemptions for cherries or cherry products utilized for exempt purposes, handlers must apply to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of an existing exemption by November 1 for the next succeeding year, except for the 1997 year only, handlers may apply through February 5, 1998. A handler shall have one crop year to dispose of cherries or cherry products to exempt outlets approved by the Board, unless granted a renewal. Handlers applying to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of an existing exemption are subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) When applying to the Board for an exemption for new product development, handlers must detail the nature of their new product, how it differs from current, existing products and the anticipated short and long term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.</P>
              <P>(2) When applying to the Board for an exemption for new market development, handlers must detail the nature of their new market, how it differs from current, existing markets and the anticipated short and long term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.</P>
              <P>(3) When applying to the Board for an exemption for the use of domestic tart cherry products in markets not currently served by the domestic industry, handlers may provide a verifiable statement from the buyer of its intent to use domestic tart cherry products to the Board staff for review in lieu of review by the subcommittee as detailed in paragraph (d) of this section. A verifiable statement is defined as a written statement from the buyer that it will use domestic tart cherries in products or markets not currently supplied by domestic sources, which will be reviewed and documented by Board staff.</P>
              <P>(4) When applying to the Board for an exemption for the development of export markets for tart cherries or cherry products (including juice and juice concentrate) in countries other than Canada and Mexico, including the expansion of sales in existing export markets, handlers must detail the nature of their product, specify whether such product differs from current products being sold in export markets, and estimate the anticipated short and long term sales volumes for the requested exemption.</P>

              <P>(5) When applying to the Board for an exemption for experimental purposes, handlers must indicate the preliminary and/or developmental experimental activity. Such experimental purposes should be intended to result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for existing tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration and volume which the proposing <PRTPAGE P="248"/>party shall specify at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case shall an exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent per handler of tart cherries during the duration of the experiment.</P>
              <P>(6) To be eligible for new product, new market development and market expansion diversion exemptions, a handler must demonstrate involvement in the activity for which the exemptions are sought. The requesting handler must either be or have been involved in development of the product, the market, or market expansion activities for which the exemptions are sought or have had financial involvement in the activities. This involvement must be demonstrated and established to the satisfaction of the Board by the handler requesting the exemptions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of applications.</E> A Board appointed subcommittee shall review applications for exemption or renewal of exemption and either approve or deny the exemption. The subcommittee shall consist of three members and one alternate, each having no handler affiliation but knowledge of the tart cherry industry, one of whom shall be the public member or the alternate public member if available to serve. Any denial of an application for exemption or renewal of an existing exemption shall be served on the applicant by certified mail and shall state the reasons for the denial. Within 10 days after the receipt of a denial, the applicant may file an appeal, in writing, with the Deputy Administrator, Specialty Crops Program, supported by any arguments and evidence the applicant may wish to offer as to why the application for exemption or renewal of exemption should have been approved. The Deputy Administrator, upon consideration of such appeal, will take such action as deemed appropriate with respect to the application for exemption or renewal of exemption.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Progress report.</E> Each handler that is granted an exemption must submit to the Board an annual progress report, due May 1 of each crop year. The progress report shall include the results of the exemption activity (comparison of intended activity with actual activity) for the year in its entirety, the volume of exempted fruit, an analysis of the success of the exemption program, and such other information as the Board may request.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Diversion credit; failure to meet terms and conditions of exemption.</E> Handler diversion certificates for exempt uses shall be issued to handlers provided that terms and conditions applicable to exempt uses are satisfied. Diversion certificates will not be issued to handlers for any volume of tart cherry products for which such terms and conditions are not satisfied and such cherries would be subject to all of the terms and conditions of §§ 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and §§ 930.55 through 930.57.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to meet terms and conditions for exemption.</E> Upon termination of an exemption, any volume of tart cherry products that were granted an exemption but were not utilized for the authorized exempt purpose would be subject to all of the terms and conditions of §§ 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and §§ 930.55 through 930.57.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Extensions and transfers.</E> (1) If no shipments are made within the first year of any approved exemption project from the date of approval, new applications for a similar project (same market or product) are eligible for approval; <E T="03">provided that,</E> handlers with an approved exemption project have the opportunity to apply to the subcommittee for a six-month extension of this time period.</P>
              <P>(2) For projects granted extensions, if no shipment is made prior to the end of the extension period, new applications for the same market or project are eligible for approval.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deferment of restricted obligation.</SUBJECT>

              <P>A handler may obtain a surety bond on restricted percentage cherries to be posted to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserves must be held. The surety bond must be posted at two times the market value of the quantity of cherries for which the holding obligation is being deferred. The Board can <PRTPAGE P="249"/>temporarily defer the date inventory reserve cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler. However, this date shall not be later than 60 days prior to the end of the crop year. The deferment shall be conditioned on the execution and delivery by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within 30 days after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage under § 930.51. The written undertaking (required to be secured by a bond or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board) must guarantee that on or prior to the deferment date requested by the handler the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage obligation. On or prior to the deferment date requested by the handler, the handler will have to fully satisfy the restricted percentage obligation. In the event, a handler has posted the surety bond, reached the deferment date deadline and does not have cherries in the inventory reserve to cover his/her inventory reserve obligation, the bond will be forfeited to the Board. The Board will then buy cherries to fulfill that handler's obligation.</P>

                <P>(a) As each handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal year, each handler who first handles olives during the current crop year shall pay to the committee, upon demand, assessments less any amounts which may be credited pursuant to § 932.45, on all olives to be used in the production of packaged olives, including olives to be used in canned ripe olives of the “tree-ripened” type or green olives when such are regulated as packaged olives pursuant to § 932.52. The payment of assessments for maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such handler during a fiscal year in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period. At any time during or after the fiscal year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all olives handled during the applicable crop year. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal year before sufficient operation income is available from assessments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.</P>
                <P>(c) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by the committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest and late payment charge shall be as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within the presecribed period of time shall be subject to an interest or late payment charge or both.</P>

                <P>(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the committee shall refund or credit to handler accounts the aforesaid excess.

Excess funds may be used temporarily by the committee to defray expenses of the subsequent fiscal year: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That each handler's share of such excess shall be made available to the handler by the committee within five months after the end of the fiscal year.</P>

Such reserve funds may be used for any expenses authorized pursuant to § 932.38 and for necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part.

                <P>(1) The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, establish or provide for the establishment of production research, and marketing research and development projects designed to assist, improve or promote the marketing, distribution, and consumption or efficient production of California olives. Such projects may provide for any marketing research and development projects designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, and consumption or efficient production of California olives. Such projects may provide for any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising. The expenses of such research and projects shall be paid from funds collected pursuant to § 932.39 or from voluntary contributions. Voluntary contributions may be accepted by the committee only to pay the expenses of such projects: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the committee shall retain complete control over the use of such contributions which shall be free from any encumbrances.</P>
                <P>(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may provide for crediting a portion of a handler's direct expenditures for paid brand advertising for olives. Such expenditures may include, but are not limited to, money spent for advertising space in magazines, newspapers, outdoor media and transit or time charges for radio and television. No handler shall receive credit in excess of such handler's pro rata share of the total monies allotted by the committee for brand advertising credit. Each advertisement must be published, broadcast or displayed during the fiscal year for which credit is requested. Before any creditable brand advertising may be undertaken pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary, upon recommendation by the committee, shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations as are necessary to effectively regulate such activity.</P>
                <P>(b) In recommending marketing research and development projects pursuant to this section, the committee shall give consideration to the following factors:</P>
                <P>(1) The expected supply of olives in relation to market requirements;</P>
                <P>(2) The supply situation among competing areas and commodities; and</P>
                <P>(3) The need for marketing research with respect to any marketing development activity and the need for a coordinated effort with USDA's Plentiful Food Program.</P>
                <P>(c) In recommending production research projects pursuant to this section, the committee shall give consideration to the extent and need for assistance to, and improvement of California olive production.</P>
                <P>(d) If the committee should conclude that a program of production research, marketing research, or development should be undertaken or continued pursuant to this section in any fiscal year, it shall submit the following for the approval of the Secretary:</P>
                <P>(1) Its recommendations as to funds to be obtained pursuant to § 932.39 or voluntary contributions;</P>
                <P>(2) Its recommendations as to any production research or marketing research project; and</P>

                <P>(3) Its recommendation as to promotion activity and paid advertising.<PRTPAGE P="258"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) The committee shall, as soon as practicable, prepare and mail reports on current production research and marketing research and development projects to the Secretary and make a copy of such reports available at the committee office for examination by producers, handlers, or other interested parties.</P>

                <P>At least 14 days prior to the start of each crop year (except that this period may be shortened by the committee not more than 5 days if warranted), the committee shall hold a meeting for the purpose of formulating a marketing policy for the coming crop year: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That with respect to the 1982-83 crop year the committee shall hold a meeting for such purpose as soon as practicable. The committee shall prepare and submit to the Secretary promptly after each such meeting, a report setting forth its recommended marketing policy for the ensuing crop year. In the event it becomes advisable to modify such policy, because of changed supply, demand, or other conditions, the committee shall formulate a new policy and shall submit a report thereon to the Secretary. In developing the marketing policy, the committee shall give consideration to the handler carryover, production, probable quality and composition of olive sizes in the crop, trade demand, probable imports, whether producer prices are likely to exceed parity, the probable assessable tonnage and such other factors as may have a bearing on the marketing of olives or the administration of this part. Notice of the committee's marketing policy, and of any modifications thereof, shall be given promptly by reasonable publicity to producers and handlers.</P>

              <P>(2) Following such meetings, and no later than March 15 of each odd-numbered year, the Committee shall prepare and mail a ballot to each producer that delivered olives during that crop year in each district.</P>
              <P>(i) A producer who produces olives in more than one district must choose the district in which the producer will vote and notify the Committee of that choice. If the Committee is not notified and more than one ballot is received from such a producer, the first ballot received will be counted. Candidates may only vote in the district in which they are seeking nomination.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each ballot will list separately the names of candidates for the member positions and the names of candidates for the alternate member positions for said district.</P>
              <P>(iii) A ballot will be mailed to producers of record to give them an opportunity to vote. Committee records will be used to determine the list of producers eligible to cast ballots. However, any producer who is not identified in such records may receive a ballot if the Committee determines that such producer is eligible to participate in nominations in that district.</P>
              <P>(iv) A producer may cast a vote for as many candidates as there are member or alternate positions in said district.</P>
              <P>(v) The candidate on each list, as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, who receives the most votes will be the nominee for the first position, and until all positions for that district are filled, the candidates receiving the second, third and fourth highest number of votes will be the nominees for the second, third and fourth position respectively.</P>
              <P>(vi) In the event of a tie which would result in elimination of a tied candidate, a second ballot with the names of those tied candidates will be mailed to producers in said district for another vote.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nomination meetings.</E> In lieu of the mail ballot nomination procedure specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Committee may schedule nomination meetings. In such an event, the following procedure will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Prior to March 15 of each odd-numbered year, the Committee shall schedule a nomination meeting to be held in each district for the purpose of obtaining nominees for producer members and alternate members for such district.</P>
              <P>(2) Nominations for members and balloting thereon shall precede nominations and balloting for alternate members.</P>

              <P>(3) The candidate for each position who receives the highest number of votes shall be the nominee for the position: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such candidate receives a majority of the ballots cast. If no candidate receives such a majority, the two candidates who received the highest number of votes shall participate in a run-off balloting to determine which is the nominee.</P>

              <P>(c) For the purposes of this section, a producer is a person engaged in a proprietary capacity as a single business unit in the production of olives for market as packaged olives and includes <PRTPAGE P="267"/>an individual (owner-operated), partnership, corporation, association, institution, or other legal business unit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of producer eligibility.</E> (1) Only producers (including duly authorized officers or employees of producers) who produced olives within the district shall participate in the nomination and election of producer members and alternates.</P>
              <P>(2) Each producer (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be entitled to cast only one vote for each position.</P>
              <P>(3) A producer having olive acreage in more than one district may participate in nominations and elections in only one district. The district in which the producer wishes to participate shall be the producer's choice.</P>
              <P>(4) Any member of a producer's family (husband, wife, son or daughter) may vote on behalf of an owner-operated, landlord-tenant, family enterprise, or other farming unit.</P>
              <P>(5) Any authorized officer or employee of a corporation which is a producer may vote.</P>
              <P>(6) Any authorized member of a partnership which is a producer may vote.</P>
              <P>(7) Power of attorney (proxies) for voting purposes are not accepted.</P>

                <P>(a) The funds to cover the committee's expenses pursuant to § 945.40 shall be acquired by the levying of assessments upon handlers as provided in this subpart. Each handler who ships potatoes as the first handler thereof shall pay assessments to the committee upon demand, which assessments shall be in payment of such handler's pro rata share of such expenses.</P>
                <P>(b) Assessments shall be levied upon handlers at a rate per hundredweight of potatoes or equivalent established by the Secretary. Such rate may be established upon the basis of the committee's budget recommendations, and other available information.</P>
                <P>(c) At any time during or subsequent to a given fiscal period, the committee may recommend the approval of an amended budget and an increase in the rate of assessment. Upon the basis of such recommendation, or other available information, the Secretary may approve an amended budget and increase the rate of assessment. Such increase shall be applicable to all potatoes assessable under this part and handled by the first handler thereof during such fiscal period.</P>
                <P>(d) The committee may impose a late payment charge or an interest charge, or both, on any handler who fails to pay, on or before the due date established by the Secretary, the total assessment for which such handler is liable. Such due date and the late payment fee and interest rate shall be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(e) In order to provide funds to carry out its function, after the effective date of this subpart the committee may accept advance assessments from handlers. Advance assessments received from a handler shall be credited toward assessments levied against that handler during that fiscal period. In the case of an extreme emergency, the committee may also borrow money on a short term basis to provide funds for the administration of this part. Any <PRTPAGE P="299"/>such borrowed money shall only be used to meet the committee's current financial obligations, and the committee shall repay all borrowed money by the end of the next fiscal period from assessment income.</P>

Whenever the committee finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in special outlets, and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and further certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms <E T="03">U.S. Extra No. 1, U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 2, Size B, fairly clean, moderately skinned,</E> and <E T="03">slightly skinned</E> shall have the same meaning as when used in the United States Standards for Potatoes (7 CFR 51.1540-51.1566), including the tolerances set forth therein. The term <E T="03">prepeeling</E> means the commercial preparation in a prepeeling plant of clean, sound, fresh potatoes by washing, peeling, or otherwise removing the outer skin, trimming, sorting, and properly treating to prevent discoloration preparatory to sale in one or more of the styles of peeled potatoes described in § 52.2422 of the United States Standards for Peeled Potatoes (7 CFR 52.2421-52.2433). The term <E T="03">other processing</E> has the same meaning as the term appearing in the act and includes, but is not restricted to, potatoes for dehydration, chips, shoestrings, starch, and flour. It includes only that preparation of potatoes for market which involves the application of heat or cold to such an extent that the natural form or stability of the commodity undergoes a substantial change. The act of peeling, cooling, slicing, dicing, or applying material to prevent oxidation does not constitute “other processing.” The terms <E T="03">Idaho Utility</E> grade and <E T="03">Oregon Utility</E> grade shall have the same meaning as when used in the standards for potatoes for the respective State. Other terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement No. 98 and Order No. 945, both as amended.</P>

Such increase shall be applicable to all potatoes handled during the given fiscal period. The payment of expenses for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required during periods when no regulations are in effect. If a handler does not pay his assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be increased by a late payment charge or an interest charge, or both, at rates prescribed by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.</P>

Shipments specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vii) of this section shall be exempt from assessment requirements as specified in § 946.248 and established pursuant to § 946.41.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Safeguards.</E> (1) Handlers desiring to make shipments of potatoes for prepeeling shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the committee of intent to ship potatoes by applying on forms furnished by the committee for a certificate applicable to such special purpose shipments;</P>

              <P>(ii) Prepare on forms furnished by the committee a special purpose shipment report on each such shipment, a copy of which must also accompany each shipment. The handler shall forward copies of each such special purpose shipment report to the committee office and to the receiver with instructions to the receiver to sign and return a copy to the committee office. Failure of the handler or receiver to report such shipments by promptly signing and returning the applicable special purpose shipment report to the committee office shall be cause for cancellation of such handler's certificate applicable to such special purpose shipments and/or the receiver's eligibility to receive further shipments pursuant to such certificate. Upon cancellation <PRTPAGE P="324"/>of such certificate, the handler may appeal to the committee for reconsideration; such appeal shall be in writing;</P>
              <P>(iii) Before diverting any such special purpose shipment from the receiver of record as previously furnished to the committee by the handler such handler shall submit to the committee a revised special purpose shipment report.</P>
              <P>(2) Handlers desiring to ship potatoes for grading or storing to any specified location in Morrow or Umatilla Counties in the State of Oregon shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the committee of intent to ship potatoes by applying on forms furnished by the committee for a certificate applicable to such special purpose shipment. Upon receiving such application, the committee shall supply to the handler the appropriate certificate after it has determined that adequate facilities exist to accommodate such shipments and that such potatoes will be used only for authorized purposes;</P>
              <P>(ii) If reshipment is for any purpose other than as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, each handler desiring to make reshipment of potatoes which have been graded or stored shall, prior to reshipment, cause each such shipment to be inspected by an authorized representative of the Federal-State Inspection Service. Such shipments must comply with the minimum grade, size, cleanness, maturity, and pack requirements specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) If reshipment is for any of the purposes specified in paragraph (d) of this section, each handler making reshipment of potatoes which have been graded or stored shall do so in accordance with the applicable safeguard requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Each handler making shipments of potatoes for canning, freezing, or “other processing” pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall:</P>
              <P>(i) First apply to the committee for and obtain a Special Purpose Certificate to make shipments for processing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Make shipments only to those firms whose names appear on the committee's list of canners, freezers, or other processors of potato products maintained by the committee, or to persons not on the list provided the handler furnishes the committee, prior to such shipment, evidence that the receiver may reasonably be expected to use the potatoes only for canning, freezing, or other processing;</P>
              <P>(iii) Upon request by the committee, furnish reports, or cause reports to be furnished, for each shipment pursuant to the applicable Special Purpose Certificate;</P>
              <P>(iv) Mail to the office of the committee a copy of the bill of lading for each Special Purpose Certificate shipment promptly after the date of shipment unless other arrangements are made;</P>
              <P>(v) Bill each shipment directly to the applicable processor.</P>
              <P>(4) Each receiver of potatoes for processing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Complete and return an application form for consideration of approval as a canner, freezer, or other processor of potato products;</P>
              <P>(ii) Certify to the committee and to the Secretary that potatoes received from the production area for processing will be used for such purpose and will not be placed in fresh market channels;</P>
              <P>(iii) Report on shipments received as the committee may require and the Secretary approve.</P>
              <P>(5) Each handler desiring to make shipments of potatoes for experimentation shall:</P>
              <P>(i) First apply to the committee for and obtain a Special Purpose Certificate to make shipments for experimentation;</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon request by the committee, furnish reports of each shipment pursuant to the applicable Special Purpose Certificate.</P>
              <P>(6) Handlers diverting potatoes to livestock feed are not required to apply for a Special Purpose Certificate nor report such shipments to the committee.</P>
              <P>(7) Each handler desiring to make shipments of potatoes for charity shall:</P>

              <P>(i) First apply to the committee for, and obtain, a Special Purpose Certificate for the purpose of making shipments for charity: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That shipments for charity of 1,000 pounds or less are exempt from the application and reporting requirements: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That potatoes previously <PRTPAGE P="325"/>graded, assessed, and inspected in preparation for shipment to the fresh market are exempt from the application and reporting requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each handler shipping potatoes to charity must inform the recipient that the potatoes cannot be resold or otherwise placed in commercial market channels.</P>
              <P>(8) Each handler making shipments of seed potatoes shall furnish, at the request of the committee, reports on the total volume of seed potatoes handled.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Minimum quantity exemption.</E> Each handler may ship up to, but not to exceed 5 hundredweight of potatoes per day without regard to the inspection and assessment requirements of this part, but this exception shall not apply to any shipment over 5 hundredweight of potatoes.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> (1) Except when relieved by paragraphs (d) or (f) of this section, no person may handle any potatoes unless a Federal-State Inspection Notesheet or certificate covering them has been issued by an authorized representative of the Federal-State Inspection Service and the document is valid at the time of shipment.</P>
              <P>(2) U.S. No. 1 grade or better potatoes in the State of Washington which are resorted or repacked within 72 hours of being inspected and certified are exempt from reinspection.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms <E T="03">U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 2, not seriously damaged by dirt, fairly clean, slightly skinned,</E> and <E T="03">moderately skinned</E> shall have the same meaning as when used in the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes (7 CFR 51.1540-51.1566), including the tolerances set forth in it. The term <E T="03">prepeeling</E> means the commercial preparation in the prepeeling plant of clean, sound, fresh tubers by washing, peeling or otherwise removing the outer skin, trimming, sorting, and properly treating to prevent discoloration preparatory to sale in one or more of the styles of peeled potatoes described in § 52.2422 United States Standards for Grades of Peeled Potatoes (7 CFR 52.2421-52.2433). The term <E T="03">other processing</E> has the same meaning as the term appearing in the Act and includes, but is not restricted to, potatoes for dehydration, chips, shoestrings, starch, and flour. It includes the application of heat or cold to such an extent that the natural form or stability of the commodity undergoes a substantial change. The act of peeling, cooling, slicing, dicing, or applying material to prevent oxidation does not constitute “other processing.” Other terms used in this section have the same meaning as when used in the marketing agreement, as amended, and this part.</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms <E T="03">U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 2, Size B, moderately skinned</E> and <E T="03">slightly skinned</E> shall have the same meaning as when used in the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes (7 CFR 51.1540-51.1566) including the tolerances set forth therein. The term <E T="03">prepeeling</E> means the commercial preparation in a prepeeling plant of clean, sound, fresh potatoes by washing, peeling or otherwise removing the outer skin, trimming, sorting, and properly treating to prevent discoloration preparatory to sale in one or more of the styles of peeled potatoes described in § 52.2422 United States Standards for Grades of Peeled Potatoes (7 CFR 52.2421-52.2433). The term <E T="03">other processing</E> has the same meaning as the term appearing in the act and includes, but is not restricted to, potatoes for dehydration, chips, shoestrings, starch, and flour. It includes only that preparation of potatoes for market which involves the application of heat or cold to such an extent that the natural form or stability of the commodity undergoes a substantial change. The act of peeling, cooling, slicing, dicing, or applying material to prevent oxidation does not constitute “other processing.” The term <E T="03">manufacture or conversion into specified products</E> means the preparation of potatoes for market into products by peeling, slicing, dicing, applying material to prevent oxidation, or other means approved by the committee, but not including other processing. All other terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement No. 97, as amended, and this part.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Onions for peeling, chopping, or slicing.</E> Onions that have been inspected and certified as meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and that are subsequently peeled, chopped, or sliced for fresh market within the production area may be handled without reinspection: <E T="03">Provided the following:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Each handler making shipments of onions for alteration or performing alteration by peeling, chopping, or slicing must furnish the committee the following information on the “Fresh Cut Report” and such other documents as required:</P>
              <P>(i) Business name, address, telephone number, signature, and the date the form was signed;</P>

              <P>(2) Handlers who peel, chop, or slice onions produced outside the production area must provide the committee with documentation showing that the onions so prepared were produced outside the production area.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Special purpose shipments.</E> (1) The minimum grade, size, maturity, pack, assessment, and inspection requirements of this section shall not be applicable to shipments of onions for any of the following purposes:</P>

              <P>(2) Shipments of onions for the purpose of experimentation, as approved by the Committee, may be made without regard to the minimum grade, size, maturity, pack, and inspection requirements of this section. Assessment requirements shall be applicable to such shipments.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Safeguards.</E> Each handler making shipments of onions outside the production area for dehydration, canning, freezing, extraction, pickling, or experimentation pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Furnish “Application to Make Special Purpose Shipments—Certificate of Privilege” and such other information to the committee as required. The committee will review and verify each “Application to Make Special Purpose Shipments—Certificate of Privilege” and notify the handler of approval or disapproval. The committee may contact the receiver or receiver's agent of the special purpose shipment for verification and request the receiver or receiver's agent to complete a “Special Purpose Shipment Receiver Certification”</P>
              <P>(2) Bill or consign each shipment directly to the applicable receiver or receiver's agent of the special purpose shipment;</P>

              <P>(3) Furnish “Onion Diversion Report” and such other information to the committee as required. Failure of the handler to furnish such report and information as required to the committee may be cause for cancellation of such handlers' Certificate of Privilege. Upon cancellation of any such Certificate of Privilege the handler may appeal to the committee for reconsideration. The committee may audit a receiver or receiver's agent of the special purpose shipment to verify reports and information submitted by handlers. Failure of a receiver or receiver's agent of a special purpose shipment to comply with the committee may be cause for cancellation of the receiver's or receiver agent's eligibility to receive further special purpose shipments from <PRTPAGE P="383"/>the production area. Upon cancellation of any such Certificate of Privilege the receiver or the receiver's agent may appeal to the committee for reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Minimum quantity exemption.</E> Each handler may ship up to, but not to exceed, one ton of onions each day without regard to the inspection and assessment requirements of this part, if such onions meet minimum grade, size and maturity requirements of this section. This exception shall not apply to any portion of a shipment that exceeds one ton of onions.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms “U.S. No. 1”, “U.S. Commercial,” and “U.S. No. 2” have the same meaning as defined in the United States Standards for Grades of Onions (Other than Bermuda Granex-Grano and Creole Types), as amended (7 CFR 51.2830 through 51.2854), or the United States Standards for Grades of Bermuda-Granex-Grano Type Onions (7 CFR 51.3195 through 51.3209), as amended, whichever is applicable to the particular variety, or variations thereof specified in this section. The term “braided red onions” means onions of red varieties with tops braided (interlaced). “Pearl onions” means onions produced using specific cultural practices that limit growth to the same general size as boilers and picklers (defined in the United States Standards specified in this paragraph), and that have been inspected and certified as measuring 2 inches in diameter or less. The term “moderately cured” means the onions are mature and are more nearly well cured than fairly well cured. Other terms used in this section have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement No. 130 and this part.</P>

                <P>(c) At any time during, or subsequent to, a given fiscal period the committee may recommend the approval of an amended budget and an increase in the rate of assessment. Upon the basis of such recommendations, or other available information, the Secretary may approve an amended budget and increase the rate of assessment. Such increase shall be applicable to all onions which were regulated under this part and which were handled by the first handlers thereof during such fiscal period.</P>

If such applicant has facilities available to him that are determined by the committee to be adequate for grading and packing onions for market, and he assumes responsibility for inspection of onions handled by him, and for assessments thereon, he may be approved and recorded as a registered handler. If the committee determines from the available information that the applicant is not entitled to be registered with the committee, he shall be so informed by written notice stating the reason for denial of his application. Any registration of a handler pursuant to this section may be canceled by the committee under circumstances which would have justified denial of his application. Any handler whose registration has been canceled shall be so informed by written notice thereof stating the reason therefor. The committee shall also notify producers of each such cancellation of handler registration through committee bulletins or published notice in local newspapers of general distribution, or both.</P>

                <P>The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary may find are reasonable and likely to be incurred during each fiscal period for its maintenance and functioning, and for such purposes as the Secretary, pursuant to this subpart, determines to be appropriate. Handlers shall share expenses upon the basis of a fiscal period. Each handler's share of such expense shall be proportionate to the ratio between the total quantity of tomatoes handled by him as the first handler thereof during a fiscal period and the total quantity of tomatoes handled by all handlers as first handlers thereof during such fiscal period.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The funds to cover the committee's expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments upon handlers as provided in this subpart. Each handler who first handles tomatoes shall pay assessments to the committee upon demand, which assessments shall be in payment of such handler's pro rata share of the committee's expenses.</P>
                <P>(b) Assessments shall be levied upon handlers at rates established by the Secretary. Such rates may be established upon the basis of the committee's recommendations and other available information. Such rates may be applied to specified containers used in the production area.</P>
                <P>(c) At any time during, or subsequent to, a given fiscal period the committee may recommend the approval of an amended budget and an increase in the rate of assessment. Upon the basis of such recommendations, or other available information, the Secretary may approve an amended budget and increase the rate of assessment. Such increase shall be applicable to all tomatoes which were regulated under this part and which were shipped by the first handler thereof during such fiscal period.</P>
                <P>(d) The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>

                <P>(e) In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, or may borrow money on a short-term basis not to exceed one full-year coinciding with the existing committee's term of office. The authority of the committee to borrow money may be used only to meet financial obligations as they occur and to allow the committee a season to adjust its reserve <PRTPAGE P="404"/>funds to meet any additional obligations.</P>

                <P>(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish an operating monetary reserve and may carry over to subsequent fiscal periods excess funds in a reserve so established: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That funds in the reserve shall not exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used (i) to defray any expenses authorized under this part, (ii) to defray expenses during any fiscal period prior to the time assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses, (iii) to cover deficits incurred during any fiscal period when assessment income is less than expenses, (iv) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative, and (v) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation, and after reasonable effort by the committee it is found impracticable to return such remaining funds to handlers, such funds shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Registered handler certification.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Each handler who handles tomatoes grown in the production area must be certified as a registered handler by the committee in order to ship such tomatoes outside of the regulated area. A handler who is certified as a registered handler is a handler who has adequate facilities to meet the requirements for preparing tomatoes for market, obtains inspection on tomatoes handled, agrees to handle tomatoes in compliance with the order's grade, size and container requirements, pays applicable assessments on a timely basis, submits reports required by the committee, and agrees to comply with other regulatory requirements on the handling of tomatoes grown in the production area.</P>
                <P>(a) Based on the criteria specified in this section, the committee shall determine eligibility for certification as a registered handler. The committee or its authorized agent shall inspect a handler's facilities to determine if the facilities are adequate for preparing tomatoes for market. In order to be adequate for such purposes, the facilities must be permanent, nonportable buildings located in the production area with equipment that is nonportable for the proper washing, grading, sizing and packing of tomatoes grown in the production area.</P>
                <P>(b) Application for certification shall be executed by the handler and filed with the committee on a form, prescribed by and available at the principal office of the committee, containing the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) Business name,</P>
                <P>(2) Address of handling facilities (including telephone and facsimile number),</P>
                <P>(3) Mailing address (if different from handling facility),</P>
                <P>(4) Number of years in tomato business in Florida,</P>
                <P>(5) Type of business, and</P>
                <P>(6) Names of senior officers, partners, or principal owners with financial interest in the business.</P>
                <P>(c) If the committee determines from available information that an applicant meets the criteria specified in this section, such applicant shall be certified as a registered handler and shall be so informed by written notice from the committee. If certification is denied, such denial shall be made by the committee in writing, stating the reasons for denial.</P>
                <P>(d) A registered handler's certification shall be cancelled by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, if the handler fails to pay assessments within 45 days of the end of the assessment billing period, fails to provide reports, or no longer has adequate facilities as described in this section. Cancellation of a handler's registration shall be made in writing to the handler and shall specify the reason(s) for and effective date of such cancellation. The committee shall recertify the handler's registration at such time as the handler corrects the deficiencies which resulted in the cancellation. Certification is permanent until the committee determines, based on criteria herein, that cancellation is warranted. Persons who make deliveries of ungraded tomatoes to such certified registered handlers are hereby determined to be exempt from otherwise applicable regulations pursuant to this part.</P>
                <P>(e) During any period in which the handling of tomatoes is regulated pursuant to this part, no handler shall obtain an inspection certifying that said handler's tomatoes meet the requirements of the marketing order unless said handler has been certified as a registered handler. Any person who is not certified as a registered handler may receive inspection on tomatoes from the Federal-State Inspection Service. Such inspection certificate shall state “Fails to meet the requirements of Marketing Order No. 966 because the handler is not a registered handler.”</P>

                <SUBJECT>Meaning of “producer”.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The term “producer” is defined in § 966.8 as being any person engaged in a proprietary capacity in the production of tomatoes for market. Under the definition of “tomatoes” in § 966.5, such production must have been in the production area. Section 966.22 provides that each person selected as a committee member or alternate must be a producer, or an officer or an employee of a corporate producer. Section 966.27 provides that producers may vote for nominees for members and alternates on the Florida Tomato Committee, the administrative agency established pursuant to said marketing agreement and order. Section 966.3 defines a person as an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other business unit. The term “person” is construed to mean the business unit which produces the tomatoes for market.</P>
                <P>(a) The prevailing principle which shall apply to the determination of “producer” is who or which interest as a unit, whether an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other business unit, has the authority to pass title to the tomatoes grown and made a part of the marketable supply of tomatoes. In other words, the terms shall be limited to those who have an ownership in tomatoes produced in the production area.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Producer</E> means any person, as defined in this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Who or which owns and farms land resulting in his or its ownership of the tomatoes produced thereon;</P>

                <P>(2) Who or which rents or farms land, resulting in his or its ownership of all or a portion of the tomatoes produced thereon; or<PRTPAGE P="414"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) Who or which owns land which he or it does not farm and, as rental for such land, obtains the ownership of a portion of the tomatoes produced thereon.</P>
                <P>(c) The term “partnership” shall be deemed to include a husband and wife with respect to land, the title to which, or leasehold interest in which, is vested in them as tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants by entirety, or, under community property laws, as community property. The term “partnership” shall also be deemed to include individuals, partnerships or corporations which join together by agreement, informal or otherwise, for the purpose of growing tomatoes and which, as a unit, have authority to transfer title to such tomatoes at the time they are harvested or subsequent thereto. The term “partnership” shall also include so-called “joint ventures,” wherein one or more parties to the arrangement contributes capital and others contribute labor, management, equipment, or other services, or any variation of such contributions by two or more parties, so that it results in the growing of tomatoes and the authority to transfer title to the tomatoes so produced from that business unit to some other parties in the marketing chain.</P>
                <P>(d) Each legal entity, whether an individual, a partnership, a “joint venture,” or a corporation, so engaged in the production of tomatoes for market shall have one vote for each position which is to be filled for the district for which he or it is eligible to vote. In the case of a partnership or a “joint venture,” such vote shall not be accepted in the absence of unanimous agreement of the respective members. In the case of a corporation, such vote shall be cast pursuant to the authorization of its board of directors. In the case of a person who owns land which he or it does not farm but, as rental for such land, obtains the ownership of a portion of the tomatoes produced thereon, such person shall be regarded as the producer of that portion and entitled to one vote, and the tenant on such land shall be regarded as the producer of the remaining portion produced on such land and also entitled to one vote.</P>
                <P>(e) A producer eligible to vote is a person who produced tomatoes for market in a proprietary capacity in the production area during the then current fiscal period, i.e., between August 1, of the previous year and July 31 of the then current year. If a person who would otherwise qualify as a producer in a proprietary capacity in the production area planted tomatoes for market as fresh tomatoes during the current fiscal period, but (1) did not market any tomatoes in the fresh market during the current fiscal period due to adverse weather conditions, or (2) has tomatoes in production for fresh market during the current fiscal period, although still unharvested, he shall, nevertheless, be eligible as a producer to vote for committee nominees, if he produced and marketed tomatoes grown in the production area in the next preceding fiscal period.</P>

              <P>From October 10 through June 15 of each season, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, no person shall handle any lot of tomatoes produced in the production area for shipment outside the regulated area unless it meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Grade, size, container, and inspection requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grade.</E> Tomatoes shall be graded and meet the requirements specified for U.S. No. 1, U.S. Combination, or U.S. No. 2 of the U.S. Standards for Grades of Fresh Tomatoes. When not more than 15 percent of the tomatoes in any lot fail to meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade and not more than one-third of this 15 percent (or 5 percent) are comprised of defects causing very serious damage including not more than 1 percent of tomatoes which are soft or affected by decay, such tomatoes may be shipped and designated as at least 85 percent U.S. No. 1 grade.</P>

              <P>(iv) To allow for variations incident to proper sizing, not more than a total of ten (10) percent, by count, of the tomatoes in any lot may be smaller than the specified minimum diameter or larger than the maximum diameter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Containers.</E> (i) All tomatoes packed by a registered handler shall be packed in containers of 10, 20, and 25 pounds designated net weights.

Upon cancellation of any such certificate, the handler may appeal to the committee for reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(5) Make shipments only to those who have qualified with the committee as approved receivers.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Findings and determinations with respect to imports of Irish potatoes.</E> (1) Pursuant to section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), it is hereby found that:</P>

            <P>(i) Grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations have been issued from time to time pursuant to the following marketing orders: No. 945 (part 945 of this chapter), No. 948 (part 948 of this chapter), No. 947 (part 947 of this chapter), No. 946 (part 946 of this chapter), and No. 953 (part 953 of this chapter).<PRTPAGE P="418"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) During the past several years, grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations have been in effect pursuant to two or more of such orders during each month of the year;</P>
            <P>(iii) The marketing of Irish potatoes can be reasonably distinguished by the several seasonal categories, i.e., winter, early spring, late spring, early summer, late summer, and fall. The bulk of the fall crop is harvested and placed in storage in the fall and marketed over a period of several months extending into the following summer. But potatoes harvested from the other seasonal crops are generally marketed as the potatoes are harvested. The marketing seasons for these crops overlap.</P>
            <P>(iv) Concurrent grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations under two or more of the aforesaid marketing orders are expected in the ensuing and future seasons, as in the past.</P>
            <P>(2) Therefore it is hereby determined that:</P>
            <P>(i) Imports of red-skinned, round type potatoes during each month of the marketing year are in most direct competition with potatoes of the same type produced in the area covered by Marketing Order No. 946 (part 946 of this chapter).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Import regulations; onions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Findings and determinations with respect to onions.</E> (1) Under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), it is hereby found that:</P>
            <P>(i) Grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations have been issued regularly under Marketing Orders No. 958 and 959, both as amended;</P>
            <P>(ii) Since December 9, 1985, grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations have been in effect pursuant to these orders during the period August through July;</P>
            <P>(iii) The marketing of onions can be reasonably distinguished by the seasonal categories, i.e., late summer and early spring. The bulk of the late summer crop is harvested and placed in storage in late summer and early fall and marketed over a period of several months extending into the following spring. But the onions harvested from the early spring crop are generally marketed as soon as the onions are harvested. The marketing seasons for these crops overlap;</P>
            <P>(iv) Concurrent grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations under the two marketing orders are expected in future seasons, as in the past.</P>
            <P>(2) Therefore, it is hereby determined that: Imports of onions during the June 5 through March 9 period, and the entire year for imports of pearl and cipolline varieties of onions, are in most direct competition with the marketing of onions produced in designated counties of Idaho and Malheur County, Oregon, covered by Marketing Order No. 958, as amended (7 CFR Part 958) and during the March 10 through June 4 period the marketing of imported onions, not including pearl or cipolline varieties of onions, is in most direct competition with onions produced in designated counties in South Texas covered by Marketing Order No. 959, as amended (7 CFR part 959).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements.</E> On and after the effective date hereof no person may import onions as defined herein unless they are inspected and meet the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) During the period June 5 through March 9 of each marketing year, and the entire year for pearl and cipolline onions, whenever onions grown in designated counties in Idaho and Malheur County, Oregon, are regulated under Marketing Order No. 958, imported onions shall comply with the grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements imposed under that order.</P>
            <P>(2) During the period March 10 through June 4 of each marketing year, whenever onions grown in designated counties in South Texas are regulated under Marketing Order No. 959, imported onions, not including pearl and cipolline onions, shall comply with the grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements imposed under that order.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum quantity exemption.</E> Any importation which in the aggregate does not exceed 110 pounds (50 kilograms) may be imported without regard to the provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Plant quarantine.</E> Provisions of this section shall not supercede the restrictions or prohibitions on onions under the Plant Quarantine Act of 1912.<PRTPAGE P="421"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Designation of governmental inspection service.</E> The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food of Plant Origin Division, Plant Products Directorate, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, are hereby designated as governmental inspection services for the purpose of certifying the grade, size, quality, and maturity of onions that are imported, or to be imported, into the United States under the provisions of section 8e of the Act.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Inspection and official inspection certificates.</E> (1) An official inspection certificate certifying the onions meet the U.S. import requirements for onions under section 8e (7 U.S.C. 608e-1), issued by a designated governmental inspection service and applicable to a specified lot is required on all imports of onions.</P>
            <P>(2) Inspection and certification by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will be available and performed in accordance with the rules and regulations governing certification of fresh fruits, vegetables and other products (7 CFR part 51). Each lot shall be made available and accessible for inspection as provided therein. Cost of inspection and certification shall be borne by the applicant.</P>
            <P>(3) Since inspectors may not be stationed in the immediate vicinity of some smaller ports of entry, importers should make advance arrangements for inspection by ascertaining whether or not there is an inspector located at their particular port of entry. For all ports of entry where an inspection office is not located, each importer must give the specified advance notice to the applicable office listed below prior to the time the onions will be imported.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grade, size, quality and maturity requirements.</E> On and after the effective date hereof no person may import fresh tomatoes except pear shaped, cherry, hydroponic and greenhouse tomatoes as defined herein, unless they are inspected and meet the following requirements:</P>

            <P>(1) From October 10 through June 15 of each season, tomatoes offered for importation shall be at least 2<FR>9/32</FR> inches in diameter. Not more than 10 percent, by count, in any lot may be smaller than the minimum specified diameter. All lots of tomatoes shall be at least U.S. No. 2 grade. <E T="03">Provided,</E> That UglyRipe <SU>TM</SU> and Vintage Ripes <SU>TM</SU> tomatoes shall be graded and at least meet the requirements specified for U.S. No. 2 under the U.S. Standards for Grades of Fresh Tomatoes, except they are exempt from the requirements that they be reasonably well formed and not more than slightly rough, and <E T="03">Provided,</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="423"/>Further that the UglyRipe <SU>TM</SU> and Vintage Ripes <SU>TM</SU> tomatoes meet the requirements of the Identity Preservation program, Fresh Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, USDA.</P>
            <P>(2)—(3) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum quantity exemption.</E> Any importation which in the aggregate does not exceed 60 pounds may be imported without regard to the provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Plant quarantine.</E> Provisions of this section shall not supersede the restrictions or prohibitions on tomatoes under the Plant Quarantine Act of 1912.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Designation of governmental inspection service.</E> The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food of Plant Origin Division, Plant Products Directorate, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, are hereby designated as governmental inspection services for the purpose of certifying the grade, size, quality, and maturity of tomatoes that are imported, or to be imported, into the United States under the provisions of section 8e of the Act.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Inspection and official inspection certificates.</E> (1) An official inspection certificate certifying the tomatoes meet the United States import requirements for tomatoes under Section 8e (7 U.S.C. 608e-1), issued by a designated governmental inspection service and applicable to a specified lot is required on all imports of fresh tomatoes.</P>
            <P>(2) Inspection and certification by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will be available and performed in accordance with the rules and regulations governing certification of fresh fruits, vegetables and other products (7 CFR part 51). Each lot shall be made available and accessible for inspection as provided therein. Cost of inspection and certification shall be borne by the applicant.</P>
            <P>(3) Since the inspectors may not be stationed in the immediate vicinity of some smaller ports of entry, importers should make advance arrangements for inspection by ascertaining whether or not there is an inspector located at their particular port of entry. For all ports of entry where an inspection office is not located, each importer must give the specified advance notice to the applicable office listed below prior to the time the tomatoes will be imported.</P>

Nominees for each respective member and alternate member shall be chosen by ballot delivered to the Board. Nominees chosen by the Board in this manner shall be submitted by the Board to the Secretary on or before June 1 of each year together with such information as the Secretary may require. If a nomination for any Board member or alternate is not received by the Secretary on or before June 1, the Secretary may select such member or alternate from persons belonging to the group to be represented without nomination. The Board shall mail to all handlers and growers, other than the cooperative(s) of record, the required ballots with all necessary voting information including the names of incumbents willing to accept renomination, and, to such growers, the name of any person proposed for nomination in a petition signed by at least 15 such growers and filed with the Board on or before April 1. Distribution of ballots shall be announced by press release, furnishing pertinent information on balloting, issued by the Board through newspapers and other publications having general circulation in the almond producing areas.</P>
                <P>(2) Nominees for the positions described in § 981.31(c) shall be handled in the same manner as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section except that those terms of office shall expire annually.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Voting.</E> (1) Nominees for each member and alternate member position shall be voted upon separately by the group proposing them. The handler or grower group which is determined to be eligible for additional representation pursuant to § 981.31 (e) and (f), respectively, shall nominate such representatives in the same manner prescribed for choosing other nominees.</P>
                <P>(2) Each handler may vote for a nominee for each position representing the group to which he belongs. Each handler vote shall be weighted by the quantity of almonds (kernel weight basis computed to the nearest whole ton) handled for his own account through December 31 of the crop year in which nominations are made. The nominee for each position shall be the person receiving the highest weighted vote for the position.</P>
                <P>(3) Growers who market their almonds through cooperative handlers shall vote through their respective organizations. Each cooperative shall cast a vote for nominees for each position representing the cooperative grower group and such ballots shall be weighted by the number of growers who are members of, or under contract with, such cooperative. The nominee for each position shall be the person receiving the highest weighted vote for that position.</P>
                <P>(4) Growers who market their almonds through other than cooperative handlers shall each have one equal vote. The nominees for each position representing such grower group shall be the person receiving the highest number of votes for that position.</P>

No handler shall receive credit for any allowable direct expenditures that would exceed the total of his <PRTPAGE P="432"/>assessment obligation which is attributable to that portion of his assessment designated for marketing promotion including paid advertising. Such expenditures may include, but are not limited to, money spent for advertising space or time in newspaper, magazines, radio, television, transit, and outdoor media, including the actual standard agency commission costs not to exceed 15 percent.</P>

From the reserve almonds that may have been withheld by him and not yet disposed of, any handler authorized to act and acting as agent of the Board in disposing of reserve pursuant to § 981.66 shall be permitted to select, under the supervision and direction of the Control Board, the particular reserve almonds to be restored to his salable percentage, and such restoration shall be deemed to fulfill the obligation of the Board with respect to such increase.</P>

In the event there are not sufficient reserve almonds held by the Board at the time the salable percentage is increased, to make full restoration, as represented by the increase in the salable percentage, to all such handlers, the restoration to the salable quantities of the respective handlers shall be pro rata on the basis of certified kernel weight poundage of reserve contributed by said handlers during the crop year to the date of increase of the salable percentage: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That restoration shall be made in a manner that will result, to the extent practicable, in a comparable percentage of reserve disposition for each such handler and that no handler shall receive almonds in excess of his contribution.

Such redetermined kernel weight for each handler shall be the basis for computing his reserve obligation for the crop year through such dates, except that adjustment shall be made for almonds on which the obligation has been assumed by another handler. The redetermined kernel weight of each handler's receipts, as of any date during the crop year, shall be his carryover as of that date plus the weight of almonds delivered or used in products minus the carryover at the beginning of the crop year, the weight on which another handler has assumed the obligations, and the weight delivered to exempt outlets. Weights used in such computations for various classifications of almonds shall be:</P>
                <P>(a) For unshelled almonds, the kernelweight based on representative samples reduced to shelled weight;</P>

Any handler who is authorized to dispose of his reserve may, through arrangement with another handler dispose of such reserve through such other handler or, in lieu of disposition, may acquire credits for reserve disposition from another handler. <PRTPAGE P="437"/>In the first instance, the second handler shall also be subject to the conditions of § 981.66. It shall be the obligation of any handler authorized to dispose of such reserve to effect disposition thereof in accordance with all applicable requirements and conditions.

Such authorization shall expire as of December 31 of the next crop year, and any reserve then remaining undisposed of by the handler shall be returned to the Board. If the date of December 31 specified in § 981.66(e) is extended, the date of December 31 shall be extended correspondingly. Any handler who has been authorized to act as agent of the Board in disposing of his reserve may terminate such agency as of April 1 of the particular crop year by giving written notice to the Board to that effect not later than the previous March 20, in which event such handler shall return to the Board, for disposition by it, all reserve almonds remaining in his possession. In case a handler does not terminate his agency as of April 1, he shall be required to continue to serve as such agent until December 31 of the next crop year. The Board shall not terminate such an agency prior to December 31 unless the agent violates the terms and conditions specified by the Board or other provisions of the order. During the period of such agency the Board, as principal, shall not dispose of the reserve withheld from handling by said agent. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary may prescribe such rules and regulations as are necessary to regulate disposition of reserve almonds including methods for crediting as reserve any salable almonds sold and delivered to reserve outlets.</P>

                <P>The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary may find are reasonable and likely to be incurred by it during each crop year, for the maintenance and functioning of the Board, including the accumulation and maintenance of an operating reserve fund, and for such purposes as the Secretary may, pursuant to the provisions of this subpart, determine to be appropriate. The recommendation of the Board as to the expenses for each such year, together with all data supporting such recommendation, shall be submitted to the Secretary on or before August 1 of the crop year in connection with which such recommendation is made.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement for payment.</E> Each handler shall pay to the Board on demand by the Board, from time to time, such sum less any amounts credited pursuant to § 981.41, based on such rate per pound of almonds, kernel weight basis, received by him for his own account (except as to receipts from other handlers on which assessments have been paid) as the Secretary finds is necessary to provide funds to meet the authorized board expenses and the operating reserve requirements, and establishes for the crop year. Upon redetermination of the kernel weight of almonds received by handlers for their <PRTPAGE P="439"/>own account as provided in § 981.61, such redetermined kernel weight for each handler, adjusted for receipts on which assessments have been paid, shall be the basis upon which he shall pay assessments. At any time during or after a crop year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessments to apply to all such almonds during such crop year to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses authorized by § 981.80 or by any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses of the Board, and such additional assessments shall be paid to the Board by each handler on demand. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Board may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Refunds.</E> Any money collected as assessments for either the administrative (maintenance and functioning) or research activities of the Board and not used for the expenses of the applicable crop year, may be used in paying the Board's expenses of the first four months of the succeeding crop year. No later than the fifth month the amount not expended from assessments collected for administrative-research in the previous crop year shall be retained in the operating reserve fund. Any amounts, not credited pursuant to § 981.41 for a crop year may be used by the Board for its marketing promotion expenses of the succeeding crop year, and any unexpended portion of those amounts at the end of that crop year shall be retained in the marketing promotion portion of the operating reserve fund. Any funds in each portion of the operating reserve fund in excess of the level authorized pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall be refunded to handlers or used to reduce the assessment rate of the subsequent crop year, as the Board may determine. Each handler's share of a refund shall be the amount by which his payment of assessments exceeds his pro rata share of the two major classifications of Board expenses. For the purpose of computing any refund from the marketing promotion portion, each handler's payment of assessments shall include any amount credited to the handler pursuant to § 981.41. In lieu of a refund, each handler may have the amount due him credited to his assessment obligation of the crop year in which the amount would be refunded.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reserves.</E> The Board may maintain an operating reserve fund consisting of an administrative-research portion and a marketing promotion portion. The amount in each portion shall not exceed approximately six-months' budget for the activity area or such lower amount as the Board may establish with the approval of the Secretary: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That this limitation shall not restrict the temporary retention of excess funds for the purpose of stabilizing or reducing the assessment rate of a crop year. To the extent that funds from current crop year assessments are inadequate, funds in the operating reserve may be used for the authorized activities of the crop year. Funds so used, and not exceeding the six-month limitation, shall be replaced to the extent practicable from assessments subsequently collected for the crop year.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Disposition of funds upon termination.</E> Any money collected from assessments hereunder and remaining unexpended in possession of the Board upon the termination of this part shall be distributed in such manner as the Secretary may direct.</P>
                <P>(e) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by the Board may be subject to an interest or late payment charge or both. The period of time, rate of interest and late payment charge shall be as recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within the prescribed period of time shall be subject to an interest or late payment charge or both.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition. Adjusted kernel weight</E> shall mean the actual gross weight of any lot of almonds: Less weight of containers; less moisture of kernels in excess of five percent; less shells, if applicable; less processing loss of one percent for deliveries with less than 95 percent kernels; less trash or other foreign material. The adjusted kernel weight shall be determined by sampling certified by the inspection agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation.</E> The computation of adjusted kernel weight shall be in the manner shown in the following examples. The examples are based on the analysis of a 1,000 gram sample taken from a lot of almonds weighing 10,000 pounds with less than 95 percent kernels, and a 1,000 gram sample taken from a lot of almonds weighing 10,000 pounds with 95 percent or more kernels. The first computation example is for the lot with less than 95 percent kernels containing the following: Edible kernels, 530 grams; inedible kernels, 120 grams; foreign material, 350 grams, and moisture content of kernels, seven percent. Excess moisture is two percent. The second computation example is for the lot with 95 percent or more kernels containing the following: Edible kernels, 840 grams; inedible kernels, 120 grams; foreign material, 40 grams; and moisture content of kernels, seven percent. Excess moisture is two percent. The example computations are as follows:<PRTPAGE P="442"/>

Credit will be granted either in the form of a payment from the Board, or as an offset to that portion of the assessment if activities are conducted and documented to the satisfaction of the Board at least 2 weeks prior to the Board's first and second assessment billings, and at least 3 weeks prior to the Board's third and fourth assessment billings in a crop year. Credit, hereinafter termed “Credit-Back”, will be granted in an amount not to exceed 66<FR>2/3</FR> percent of a handler's proven expenditures for qualified activities.</P>

              <P>(b) The portion of the handler assessment for which credit may be received under this section will be billed, and is due and payable, at the same time as the portion of the handler assessment <PRTPAGE P="443"/>used for the Board's administrative expenses, unless the handler(s) conduct and document activities at least 2 weeks prior to the first and second assessment billings and 3 weeks prior to the third and fourth assessment billings. If the handler(s) conduct activities and submit documentation according to applicable provisions in this section, their advertising assessment obligation will be reduced according to the amount of proven activities approved by the Board.</P>
              <P>(c) The Board shall grant Credit-Back for qualifying activities only to the handler who performed such activities and who filed a claim for Credit-Back in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Credit-Back shall be granted only for qualified promotional activities which are conducted and completed during the crop year for which Credit-Back is requested.</P>
              <P>(e) The following requirements shall apply to Credit-Back for all promotional activities:</P>
              <P>(1) Credit-Back granted by the Board shall be that which is appropriate when compared to accepted professional practices and rates for the type of activity conducted. In the case of claims for Credit-Back activities not covered by specific and established criteria, the Board shall grant the claim if it is consistent with practices and rates for similar activities. To this end, the Board may issue guidelines for qualifying activities from time to time as warranted. For activities in markets other than the United States and Canada, paragraph (e)(5) of this section shall also apply.</P>
              <P>(2) The clear and evident purpose of each activity shall be to promote the sale, consumption or use of California almonds, and nothing therein shall detract from this purpose.</P>

              <P>(3) No Credit-Back will be given for advertising placed in publications that target the farming or grower trade. No Credit-Back shall be given for any outdoor advertising in California almond growing counties with more than 1,000 bearing acres: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That outdoor advertising in these counties which specifically directs consumers to a handler-operated outlet offering direct purchase of almonds will be eligible for Credit-Back.</P>
              <P>(4) Credit-Back shall be granted for those qualified activities specified below, except that Credit-Back will not be allowed in any case for travel expenses, or for any promotional activities that result in price discounting.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Paid advertising directed to end-users, trade or industrial users.</E> Credit-Back shall be granted for money spent on paid advertising space or time including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, radio, television, transit and outdoor media, and including the standard agency commission costs not to exceed 15 percent of gross.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other market promotion activities.</E> Credit-Back shall be granted for market promotion other than paid advertising, for the following activities:</P>
              <P>(A) Marketing research (except pre-testing and test-marketing of paid advertising);</P>
              <P>(B) Trade and consumer product publicity: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no Credit-Back shall be given for related fees charged by an advertising or public relations agency;</P>
              <P>(C) Printing costs for promotional material;</P>
              <P>(D) Direct mail printing and distribution;</P>
              <P>(E) Retail in-store demonstrations;</P>
              <P>(F) Point-of-sale materials (not including packaging);</P>
              <P>(G) Sales and marketing presentation kits;</P>
              <P>(H) Trade fairs and exhibits;</P>
              <P>(I) 50/50 advertising with retailers;</P>
              <P>(J) Couponing (printing, distribution, and handling costs only); and</P>

              <P>(K) Development and use of web-site on the Internet for advertising and public relations purposes, including E-commerce (mail ordering through the Internet): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That Credit-Back shall be limited to $20,000 per year for such activities, and no credit shall be given for costs for E-commerce administration, Extranet (restricted Web sites within the Internet), Intranet (inter-office communication network), or portions of a web-site that target the farming or grower trade.</P>

              <P>(iii) For any qualified activity involving joint participation by a handler and a manufacturer or seller of a complementary product(s), or a handler selling multiple complementary products, including other nuts, with <PRTPAGE P="444"/>such activity including the handler's name or brand, or the words “California Almonds”, the amount allowed for Credit-Back claim shall reflect that portion of the activity represented by almonds, or the handler's actual payment, whichever is less.</P>

              <P>(iv) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section, when products containing almonds are promoted, the amount allowed for Credit-Back shall reflect that portion of the product weight represented by almonds, or the handler's actual payment, whichever is less: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, except for mixed nut products, the amount of Credit-Back for qualified promotional activities for products containing almonds shall be granted at 66<FR>2/3</FR> percent of proven expenditures, if the product is owned or distributed by the handler and such ownership or distributorship is stated on the package: <E T="03">Provided Further,</E> That to receive any level of credit, the product must display the handler's name, the handler's brand, or the words “California Almonds” on the primary, face label.</P>
              <P>(5) Credit-Back for promotional activities in a foreign market shall be granted at 66<FR>2/3</FR> percent of a handler's unreimbursed expenditures for qualified activities in any foreign market, if the handler is promoting pursuant to a contract with the Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA (FAS) and/or the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Such activities must also meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (6) of this section. Unless the Board is administering the foreign marketing program, such activities shall not be eligible for Credit-Back unless the handler certifies that he/she was not and will not be reimbursed by either FAS or the CDFA for the amount claimed for Credit-Back, and has on record with the Board all claims for reimbursement made to FAS and/or the CDFA. Foreign market expenses paid by third parties as part of a handler's contract with FAS or CDFA will not be eligible for Credit-Back.</P>
              <P>(6) A handler must file claims with the Board to obtain Credit-Back for promotional expenditures, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) All claims submitted to the Board for any qualified activity must include:</P>
              <P>(A) A description of the activity and when and where it was conducted;</P>
              <P>(B) Copies of all invoices from suppliers or agencies;</P>
              <P>(C) Copies of all canceled checks issued by the handler in payment of these invoices; and</P>
              <P>(D) An actual sample, picture or other physical evidence of the activity.</P>

              <P>(ii) Handlers may receive credit against their assessment obligation up to the advertising amount of the assessment installment due: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That handlers submit the required documentation for a qualified activity at least 2 weeks prior to the mailing of the Board's first and second assessment notices, and at least 3 weeks prior to the mailing of the Board's third and fourth assessment notices in a crop year. In all other instances, handlers must remit the advertising assessment to the Board when billed, and a refund will be issued to the extent of proven, qualified activities.</P>
              <P>(iii) Checks from the Board in payment of approved Credit-Back claims will be mailed to handlers on February 15, April 15, June 15, and 30 days after submission of final claims for the crop year pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section. To receive payment on these dates, handler claims must be submitted, with all required elements, at least one month prior to the payment date. A handler can receive Credit-Back for his/her allowable direct expenditures only up to the amount of that portion of the handler's assessment designated for marketing promotion, including paid advertising.</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement of the Credit-Back commitments outstanding as of the close of a crop year must be submitted in full to the Board within 15 days after the close of that crop year. Final claims pertaining to such commitments outstanding must be submitted with all required elements within 76 days after the close of that crop year. All other final claims for which no statement of Credit-Back commitments outstanding has been filed must be submitted by August 15 of that calendar year.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If a determination is made by the Board staff that a particular promotional activity is not eligible for Credit-Back because it does <PRTPAGE P="445"/>not meet the criteria specified herein, or for any other reason, the affected handler may request the Public Relations and Advertising Committee to review the Board staff's decision. If the affected handler disagrees with the decision of the Public Relations and Advertising Committee, the handler may request that the Board review the Committee decision. If the handler disagrees with the decision of the Board, the handler, through the Board, may request that the Secretary review the Board's decision. Handlers have the right to request anonymity in the review of their appeal. The Secretary maintains the right to review any decisions made by the aforementioned bodies at his/her discretion.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Quality control.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Incoming.</E> Pursuant to § 981.42(a), the quantity of inedible kernels in each variety of almonds received by a handler, including almonds of his own production, shall be determined and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sampling.</E> Each handler shall cause a representative sample of almonds to be drawn from each lot of any variety received. The sample shall be drawn before inedible kernels are removed from the lot, or the lot is processed or stored by the handler. For receipts at premises with mechanical sampling equipment and under contracts providing for payment by the handler to the producer for sound meat content, samples shall be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency. The inspection agency shall make periodic checks of the mechanical sampling procedures. For all other receipts, including but not limited to field examination and purchase receipts, accumulations purchased for cash at the handler's door or from an accumulator, or almonds of the handler's own production, sampling shall be conducted or monitored by the inspection agency in a manner acceptable to the Board. All samples shall be bagged and identified in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Variety.</E> For the purpose of classifying receipts by variety to determine a handler's disposition obligation, “variety” shall mean that variety of almonds which constitutes at least 90 percent of the lot: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That lots containing a combination of Butte and Padre varieties only, shall be classified as “Butte-Padre”, regardless of the percentage of each variety in the lot. If no variety constitutes at least 90 percent of the almonds in a lot, the lot shall be classified as “mixed”: <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That if the variety or varieties of almonds in a lot are not identified, the lot shall be classified as “mixed”, regardless of the percentage of each variety in a lot.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Analysis of sample.</E> Each sample shall be analyzed by or under the surveillance of the inspection agency to determine the kernel content and the proportion of inedible kernels in the sample. The inspection agency shall prepare a report for each handler showing, by variety, the total adjusted kernel weight received by handler, the inedible kernel weight and any other information as the Board may prescribe. The report shall cover the handler's daily receipt or the handler's total receipts during a period not exceeding one week, and shall be submitted by the inspection agency to the Board and the handler.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disposition obligation.</E> (i) Beginning August 1, 2016, the weight of inedible kernels in excess of 2 percent of kernel weight reported to the Board of any variety received by a handler shall constitute that handler's disposition obligation. For any almonds sold inshell, the weight may be reported to the Board and the disposition obligation for that variety reduced proportionately.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a sufficient sample is not available for any lot of almonds, the handler may establish and substantiate, to the satisfaction of the Board, the received weight, the edible and inedible kernel weights, and the adjusted kernel weight by providing sufficient information as the Board may prescribe. If the handler is only able to establish and substantiate the approximate received weight, an inedible disposition obligation of 10 percent of such received <PRTPAGE P="446"/>weight may be applied, upon agreement between the Board and the handler.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Meeting the disposition obligation.</E> Each handler shall meet its disposition obligation by delivering packer pickouts, kernels rejected in blanching, pieces of kernels, meal accumulated in manufacturing, or other material, to crushers, feed manufacturers, feeders, or dealers in nut wastes on record with the Board as accepted users. Handlers shall notify the Board at least 72 hours prior to delivery: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Board or its employees may lessen this notification time whenever it determines that the 72 hour requirement is impracticable. The Board may supervise deliveries at its option. In the case of a handler having an annual total obligation of less than 1,000 pounds, delivery may be to the Board in lieu of an accepted user, in which case the Board would certify the disposition lot and report the results to the USDA. For dispositions by handlers with mechanical sampling equipment, samples may be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency. For all other dispositions, samples shall be drawn by or under supervision of the inspection agency. Upon approval by the Board and the inspection agency, sampling may be accomplished at the accepted user's destination. The edible and inedible almond meat content of each delivery shall be determined by the inspection agency and reported by the inspection agency to the Board and the handler. The handler's disposition obligation will be credited upon satisfactory completion of ABC Form 8. ABC Form 8, Part A, is filled out by the handler, and Part B by the accepted user. Beginning August 1, 2006, at least 50 percent of a handler's total crop year inedible disposition obligation shall be satisfied with dispositions consisting of inedible kernels as defined in § 981.408: <E T="03">Provided</E>, That this 50 percent requirement shall not apply to handlers with total annual obligations of less than 1,000 pounds. Each handler's disposition obligation shall be satisfied when the almond meat content of the material delivered to accepted users equals the disposition obligation, but no later than September 30 succeeding the crop year in which the obligation was incurred.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Inedible almonds unfit for processing.</E> All lots received from growers as “inedible almonds unfit for processing,” shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section, but shall be disposed of in their entirety (other than as pickouts), as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Disposition of these lots shall not be credited toward the disposition obligation of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If a grower sells or ships inedible almonds to a person other than a handler, the grower thereby becomes a handler and subject to all the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Accepted users.</E> An accepted user's eligibility shall be subject to the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Annual completion of an application with the Board for accepted user status;</P>
              <P>(ii) Annual submission of a business data sheet to the Board;</P>
              <P>(iii) Annual submission of an Accepted User Plan (Form ABC 30) to the Board by July 31 of each year;</P>
              <P>(iv) The accurate and prompt submission of Form ABC 8, Part B, to the Board for each lot of almonds received. Each lot of inedible almonds received must be documented by a public weighmaster weight certificate issued at the request of the accepted user at the time of receipt of the lot. Weighmaster weight certificates must be submitted to the Board within 10 business days of issuance;</P>
              <P>(v) Disposal of inedible almond material within 6 months of receipt; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Disposal of inedible almond material received with no transfer of the material between accepted users.</P>
              <P>(vii) The Board may deny or revoke accepted user status at any time if the applicant or accepted user fails to meet the terms and conditions of § 981.442, or if the applicant or accepted user fails to meet the terms and conditions set forth in the accepted user application (Form ABC 34).</P>

              <P>(viii) The eligibility of accepted users shall be reviewed annually by the Board. Handlers will not receive credit towards their disposition obligations <PRTPAGE P="447"/>pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section for inedible lots where the difference between the weight of the lot reported by the inspection agency on Form ABC 8 and the weight of the lot reported on the public weighmaster weight certificate exceeds 2.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Outgoing.</E> Pursuant to § 981.42(b), beginning September 1, 2007, and except as provided in § 981.13 and in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, handlers shall subject their almonds to a treatment process or processes prior to shipment to reduce potential <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria contamination in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Treatment process.</E> Treatment processes shall utilize technologies that have been determined to achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria in almonds, pursuant to a letter of determination issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or acceptance by a scientific review panel as identified by the Board (Technical Expert Review Panel or “TERP”). Such panel shall be approved at least annually by the Board prior to the beginning of each crop year, or as needed during the crop year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">On-site versus off-site treatment.</E> Handlers shall subject almonds to a treatment process or processes prior to shipment either at their handling facility (on-site), or at an off-site treatment facility located within the production area. Transportation of almonds by a handler to an off-site treatment facility shall not be deemed a shipment.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Validation by process authorities.</E> Handlers shall only use, or transport their almonds to off-site treatment facilities that use treatment processes that have been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Treatment technology and equipment that have been modified to a point where operating parameters such as time, temperature, or volume change, shall be revalidated.</P>

              <P>(i) Validation means that the treatment technology and equipment have been demonstrated to achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria in almonds. Validation data prepared by a Board-approved process authority must be submitted to and accepted by the TERP for each piece of equipment used to treat almonds prior to its use under the program.</P>
              <P>(ii) A process authority is a person that has expert knowledge of appropriate processes for the treatment of almonds as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(A) Knowledge about the equipment used for the treatment process;</P>
              <P>(B) Experience in conducting appropriate studies to determine the ability of the equipment to deliver the appropriate treatment (such as heat penetration or heat distribution); and</P>
              <P>(C) Able to determine that sufficient data has been gathered to identify the critical factors needed to ensure the quality of the final product.</P>
              <P>(iii) Process authorities may be employees of the entity for which they are conducting validation. The Board shall provide process authorities specific protocols and parameters for treatment processes that are FDA determined or TERP accepted.</P>
              <P>(iv) Process authorities must submit an initial application to the Board on ABC Form No. 51, “Application for Process Authority for Almonds,” and be approved by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the TERP's decision concerning approval, the applicant may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop years, approved applicants with no changes to their initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on file.</P>
              <P>(v) The TERP may revoke any approval for cause. The TERP shall notify the process authority in writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the process authority disagree with the TERP's decision, he/she may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A process authority whose approval has been revoked must submit a new application to the TERP and await approval.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Compliance and verification.</E> In accordance with the requirements of this paragraph, handlers shall utilize either an on-site verification program (traditional), or an audit-based verification program to ensure that their almonds <PRTPAGE P="448"/>have been subjected to a treatment process to reduce <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria prior to shipment. Each handler may decide which verification program would be the most cost-effective for his or her operation.</P>
              <P>(i) By May 31, each handler shall submit to the Board a Treatment Plan for the upcoming crop year. A Treatment Plan shall describe how a handler plans to treat his or her almonds, and must address specific parameters as outlined by the Board for the handler to ship almonds. Such plan shall be reviewed by the Board, in conjunction with the inspection agency, to ensure it is complete and can be verified, and be approved by the Board. Almonds sent by a handler for treatment to an off-site facility affiliated with another handler shall be subject to the approved Treatment Plan utilized at that facility. Handlers shall follow their own approved Treatment Plans for almonds sent to an off-site facility that is not affiliated with another handler.</P>
              <P>(ii) Handlers utilizing an on-site verification program shall cause the inspection agency to verify that their Treatment Plans have been followed, and that their almonds have been subjected to a treatment process that has been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Such handlers shall submit, or cause to be submitted, a verification report to the Board. The inspection agency must physically observe the treatment process to issue such report.</P>
              <P>(iii) Handlers utilizing an audit-based verification program shall be subject to periodic audits conducted by the inspection agency. The inspection agency shall provide copies of the audit report to the Board. Handlers who do not comply with an audit-based verification program shall be required to revert to an on-site verification program.</P>
              <P>(iv) Interhandler transfers of almonds may or may not be treated prior to transfer. Handlers receiving untreated almonds from another handler shall be responsible for treating the product. Handlers receiving treated almonds from another handler must have procedures outlined in their Treatment Plan addressing how the integrity of the treated almonds will be maintained. In all instances involving interhandler transfers, the receiving handler shall be responsible for ensuring that the almonds are treated prior to shipment and maintaining documentation to that effect.</P>
              <P>(v) An off-site treatment facility that does not handle almonds, pursuant to § 981.16, shall provide access to the inspection agency and Board staff for verification of treatment and review of treatment records. A treatment process at an off-site treatment facility that has been validated by a Board approved process authority is deemed to be approved by the Board for handler use. The Board may revoke any such approval for cause. The Board shall notify the off-site treatment facility of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the off-site facility disagree with the Board's decision, it may appeal the decision in writing to USDA. Handlers may treat their almonds only at off-site treatment facilities that have been deemed to be approved by the Board.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Records.</E> Handlers shall maintain records and documentation that will be subject to audit by the Board for the purpose of verifying compliance with this section. Records must be maintained for two full years following the end of the crop year, and must identify lots from the point of treatment forward to the point of shipment by the handler. Lot identification shall also provide the ability to differentiate treated from untreated product. Off-site treatment facilities that do not handle almonds pursuant to § 981.16, shall maintain treatment records for 2 full years following the end of a crop year and make such records available to the Board.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> Handlers may ship untreated almonds under the following conditions. For purposes of this section, container means a box, bin, bag, carton, or any other type of receptacle used in the packaging of bulk almonds.</P>

              <P>(i) Handlers may ship untreated almonds for further processing directly to manufacturers located within the U.S., Canada or Mexico. This program shall be termed the Direct Verifiable (DV) program. Handlers may only ship untreated almonds to manufacturers who have submitted ABC Form No. 52, <PRTPAGE P="449"/>“Application for Direct Verifiable (DV) Program for Further Processing of Untreated Almonds,” and have been approved by the TERP. Such almonds must be shipped directly to approved manufacturing locations, as specified on Form No. 52. Such manufacturers DV users must submit an initial Form No. 52 to the Board and be approved by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the TERP's decision concerning approval, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop years, approved applicants with no changes to their initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on file. The TERP may revoke any approval for cause. The TERP shall notify the manufacturer in writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the manufacturer disagree with the TERP's decision, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A manufacturer whose approval has been revoked must submit a new application to the TERP and await approval. The Board shall issue a DV User code to an approved manufacturer. Handlers must reference such code in all documentation accompanying the lot and identify each container of such almonds with the term “unpasteurized.” Such lettering shall be on one outside principal display panel, at least <FR>1/2</FR> inch in height, clear and legible. If a third party is involved in the transaction, the handler must provide sufficient documentation to the Board to track the shipment from the handler's facility to the approved DV user. While a third party may be involved in such transactions, shipments to a third party and then to a manufacturing location are not permitted under the DV program. Approved DV Users shall:</P>

              <P>(A) Subject such almonds to a treatment process or processes using technologies that achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria as determined by the FDA, accepted by the TERP, or established by a process authority approved in accordance with and subject to the provisions and procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Establish means that the treatment process and protocol have been evaluated to ensure the technology's ability to deliver a lethal treatment for <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria in almonds to achieve a minimum 4-log reduction;</P>
              <P>(B) Identify the manufacturing locations where treatment will occur;</P>

              <P>(C) Have their treatment technology and equipment validated by a Board-approved process authority, and provide documentation with their DV application to verify that their treatment technology and equipment have been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Such documentation may include, but not be limited to, a letter from such process authority certifying the validation. Such documentation shall be sufficient to demonstrate that the treatment processes and equipment achieve a 4-log reduction in <E T="03">Salmonella</E> bacteria. Treatment technology and equipment that have been modified to a point where operating parameters such as time, temperature, or volume change, shall be revalidated;</P>

              <P>(D) Have their technology and procedures verified by a Board-approved DV auditor to ensure they are being applied appropriately. A DV auditor may not be an employee of the manufacturer that he/she is auditing. DV auditors must submit a report to the Board after conducting each audit. DV auditors must submit an initial application to the Board on ABC Form No. 53, “Application for Direct Verifiable (DV) Program Auditors,” and be approved by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the TERP's decision concerning approval, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop years, approved DV auditors with no changes to their initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on file. The TERP may revoke any approval for cause. The TERP shall notify the DV auditor in writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the DV auditor disagree with the TERP's decision, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A DV auditor whose approval has been revoked must <PRTPAGE P="450"/>submit a new application to the TERP and await approval;</P>
              <P>(E) Maintain all records regarding validation and verification of treatment methods, processing, and product traceability. Such records shall be retained for two years and shall be made available for review by the Board; and,</P>
              <P>(F) Ship any almonds which will not be treated to a handler, to another approved DV user, to locations outside the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (containers must remain identified with the term “unpasteurized”), as specified in § 981.442(b)(6)(i), or dispose of such almonds in non-edible channels.</P>
              <P>(ii) Handlers may ship untreated almonds directly or through a third party to locations outside the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, provided that each container of such almonds is identified with the term “unpasteurized.” Such lettering shall be on one outside principal display panel, at least <FR>1/2</FR> inch in height, clear and legible. If a third party is involved in the transaction, the handler must provide sufficient documentation to the Board to track the shipment from the handler's facility to the importer in the foreign country.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Other restrictions.</E> The provisions of this section do not supersede any restrictions or prohibitions regarding almonds grown in California under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or any other applicable laws or regulations or the need to comply with applicable food and sanitary regulations of city, county, State or Federal agencies.</P>

Such a transfer does not relieve the transferring handler of any reserve obligations for the applicable crop year. The transferred credit shall not exceed the quantity needed by the receiving handler to cover that handler's reserve obligation. The Board shall complete the transfer upon receipt of an ABC Form 11 executed by both handlers. No transfer of reserve credits shall be made to satisfy a handler's inedible disposition obligation incurred pursuant to § 981.42(a).</P>

              <P>(d) Transfer of inedible obligation may be made, with the approval of the <PRTPAGE P="451"/>Board, only when the inedible kernels are physically transferred with the entire lot of almonds. The transfer of the lot shall be reported on ABC Form 9, showing date of transfer and, for the transferring handler, the (1) original inspection certificate number, (2) total weight shown on the certificate, and (3) weight of inedible kernels shown on the certificate. For the receiving handler, ABC Form 9 shall show the (1) new inspection certificate number, (2) total weight shown on the certificate, and (3) weight of inedible kernels shown on the certificate.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Agents of Board.</E> Beginning with August 1 of any crop year, a handler may become an agent of the Board pursuant to § 981.67 for the purpose of disposing of reserve almonds of such crop year, in the authorized outlets. The agency shall be established upon a handler executing a reserve agreement (ABC Form 12) ABC, applicable to diversion, containing terms and conditions specified by the Board.</P>

Disposition by an agent of the Board in eligible reserve outlets within a crop year in excess of his reserve obligation shall be held to be a disposition of salable almonds. Whenever such disposition has been inspected and certified, if required, and has complied with the terms, conditions, and documentation applicable to disposition of reserve almonds as determined by the Board, the disposition may be credited against any reserve obligation subsequently incurred by the handler during that crop year, or the disposition may be credited pursuant to § 981.455(b) against the reserve obligation of another handler.</P>

If such petitions fail to result in submission of at least two names for a district, the Board shall request County Agricultural Extension Agents in that district to recommend one or more eligible growers to be included on the ballot. Ballots, accompanied by the names of all such candidates, with spaces to indicate voters' choices and spaces for write-in candidates, together with voting instructions, shall be mailed to all growers who are on record with the Board. The person receiving the highest number of votes shall be the member nominee for that district, and the person receiving the second highest number of votes shall be the alternate member. The Board shall recommend one candidate in case of a tie vote.</P>

                <P>(f) Nominations received in the foregoing manner by the Board for all handler and grower member and alternate member positions shall be certified and sent to the Secretary at least 60 days prior to the beginning of each two-year <PRTPAGE P="457"/>term of office, together with all necessary data and other information deemed by the Board to be pertinent or requested by the Secretary.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> As provided in this section, prior to September 20 of each marketing year, the Board may hold meetings for the purpose of computing its marketing policy for that year and shall do so for the purpose of submitting any recommendations on its policy to the Secretary. The Board may designate one of its employees to compute and announce the preliminary computed free and restricted percentages.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Inshell trade demand.</E> If the Board determines that volume regulation would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, it shall compute and announce an inshell trade demand for <PRTPAGE P="459"/>that year prior to September 20. The inshell trade demand shall equal the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions of inshell hazelnuts: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Board may increase such average by no more than 25 percent if market conditions justify such an increase. If the trade acquisitions during any or all of these years were abnormal because of crop or marketing conditions, the Board may use a prior year or years in determining the three-year average.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inshell allocation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Preliminary computed percentages.</E> Prior to September 20 of a marketing year, the Board shall compute and announce preliminary computed free and restricted percentages for that year, to release 80 percent of the inshell trade demand for that year. The preliminary computed free percentage shall be computed by multiplying that trade demand, adjusted by the declared carryin, by 80 percent, and by dividing that amount by the Board's estimate of orchard-run production less the average disappearance during the preceding three years, plus the undeclared carryin. The difference between 100 percent and the preliminary free percentage shall be the preliminary computed restricted percentage. At the same time, the Board may announce the portion of the restricted supply that may be shelled or exported, and the remainder of that supply to be disposed of in outlets approved by the Board pursuant to § 982.52.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim final and final percentages.</E> On or before November 15, the Board shall meet to recommend to the Secretary the interim final and final free and restricted percentages, including the portion of the restricted supply that may be shelled or exported. The interim final percentages shall release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously computed by the Board for the marketing year. The final free and restricted percentages may release an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions of inshell hazelnuts for desirable carryout. If the trade acquisitions during any or all of these years were abnormal, the Board may use a prior year or years in determining this three-year average. The final free and restricted percentages shall become effective 30 days prior to the end of the marketing year, or earlier as may be recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. The recommendations to the Secretary shall include the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The estimated tonnage of merchantable hazelnuts expected to be produced during the marketing year.</P>
                <P>(ii) The estimated tonnage of inshell hazelnuts held by handlers on the first day of the marketing year which may be available for handling as inshell hazelnuts thereafter.</P>

                <P>(iii) Any other pertinent factors bearing on the marketing of hazelnuts during the marketing year.
                </P>
                <FP>Whenever the Secretary finds, on the basis of the recommendation of the Board or other available information that, to establish the interim final and final free and restricted percentages would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, the Secretary shall establish such percentages.</FP>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Grade, size, and quality regulations.</E> Prior to September 20, the Board may consider grade, size, and quality regulations in effect and may recommend modifications thereof to the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Revision of marketing policy.</E> At any time prior to February 15 of the marketing year, the Board may recommend to the Secretary revisions in the marketing policy for that year: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in no event shall any such recommendation provide for free and restricted percentages based on an inshell trade demand which is more than 125 percent of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for that marketing year. At any time during the period December 1 through February 10 at the request of two or more handlers, who during the preceding marketing year handled at least 10 percent of all hazelnuts handled, the Board shall meet to determine whether the marketing policy should be revised.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional grade and size regulations.</E> When the season average price of hazelnuts is not determined to be above parity, the Secretary may establish additional grade and size regulations for inshell hazelnuts in the form of a more restrictive minimum standard than that specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or pack specifications as to grades and sizes that may be handled, if he finds, on the basis of a recommendation of the Board or other information, that such regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Quality regulations.</E> For any marketing year, the Board may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, such minimum quality and inspection requirements applicable to hazelnuts to facilitate the reduction of pathogens as will contribute to orderly marketing or will be in the public interest.

                <P>(a) No handler shall handle inshell hazelnuts unless prior to or upon shipment thereof, he: (1) Has withheld from handling a quantity, by weight, of certified merchantable hazelnuts determined by dividing the quantity handled, or to be handled, by the applicable free percentage and multiplying the quotient by the restricted percentage; (2) has withheld from handling an equivalent quantity of creditable ungraded inshell hazelnuts under § 982.51(a); or (3) has under § 982.51(b), declared in lieu of a quantity of certified merchantable hazelnuts, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the equivalent quantity, by weight as determined under that section, of shelled hazelnuts certified as meeting the standards in effect for Oregon No. 1 grade for shelled hazelnuts as contained in Oregon Grade Standards for Hazelnut Kernels or such other standards as may be recommended by the Board and established by the Secretary. Any handler who intends to withhold shelled hazelnuts in satisfaction of a restricted obligation must make such declaration to the Board prior to shelling any such hazelnuts. Withholding may be temporarily deferred under the bonding provisions in § 982.54. The quantity of hazelnuts required to be withheld shall be the restricted obligation. Certified merchantable hazelnuts handled in accordance with this subpart shall be deemed to be the handler's quota fixed by the Secretary within the meaning of section 8a(5) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(b) Inshell hazelnuts withheld by a handler in satisfaction of his restricted obligation shall not be handled and shall be held by him subject to examination by and accounting control of, the Board until disposed of pursuant to this part.</P>
                <P>(c) A handler having certified merchantable hazelnuts which have not been handled at the end of a marketing year may elect to have those hazelnuts bear the restricted and assessment obligations of that year or of the marketing year in which handled. The Board shall establish such procedures as are necessary to facilitate the administration of this option among handlers.</P>
                <P>(d) Whenever the restricted percentage for a marketing year is reduced, each handler's restricted obligation shall be reduced to conform with the new restricted percentage. Any handler who, upon such reduction, is withholding restricted hazelnuts in excess of his new restricted obligation may have the excess freed from withholding by complying with such procedures as the Board may require to insure identification of the remaining hazelnuts withheld.</P>

                <P>(a) A handler may withhold ungraded inshell hazelnuts in lieu of certified merchantable hazelnuts in satisfaction of that handler's restricted obligations, and the weight on which credit may be received shall be the shelled hazelnut equivalent weight as inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service multiplied by 2.5. Any lot of ungraded hazelnuts not meeting the moisture requirements for certified merchantable hazelnuts shall not be eligible for credit. All determinations as to the shelled hazelnut equivalent weight shall be made by the Federal-State Inspection Service at the handler's expense. Hazelnuts so withheld shall be subject to the applicable requirements of § 982.50. The weight of all such lots for which a handler has received credit shall be adjusted by the Board when the lots are handled or disposed of so that the creditable weight is equal to the amount of <PRTPAGE P="462"/>certified merchantable inshell hazelnuts or certified shelled hazelnuts that are subsequently handled or disposed of from those lots. If this adjustment causes the handler to no longer be in satisfaction of that handler's restricted obligation as required by § 982.50, the deficiency shall be satisfied in the subsequent marketing year. If this adjustment results in a handler disposing of, in restricted outlets, a quantity in excess of that handler's restricted obligation, such excess shall not be credited to such handler's restricted obligation during the subsequent marketing year.</P>
                <P>(b) A handler may withhold, in accordance with § 982.50(a), certified shelled hazelnuts in lieu of merchantable hazelnuts in satisfaction of such handler's restricted obligation, subject to such terms and conditions as are recommended by the Board and established by the Secretary. The inshell equivalent of such hazelnuts shall be determined by multiplying the weight of the shelled hazelnuts by 2.5.</P>
                <P>(c) The Secretary upon recommendation of the Board and other available data may modify these procedures, change the conversion factors, and specify factors for conversion for different varieties of hazelnuts.</P>

                <P>Hazelnuts withheld from handling as inshell hazelnuts pursuant to §§ 982.50 and 982.51 may be disposed of as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Shelling.</E> Any handler may dispose of such hazelnuts by shelling them under the direction or supervision of the Board or by delivering them to an authorized sheller. Any person who desires to become an authorized sheller in any marketing year may submit written application during such year to the Board. Such application shall be granted only upon condition that the applicant agrees:</P>
                <P>(1) To use such restricted hazelnuts as he may receive for no purpose other than shelling;</P>
                <P>(2) To dispose of or deliver such restricted hazelnuts, as inshell hazelnuts, to no one other than another authorized sheller;</P>
                <P>(3) To comply fully with all laws and regulations applicable to shelling of hazelnuts; and</P>
                <P>(4) To make such reports, certified to the Board and to the Secretary as to their correctness, as the Board may require.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Export.</E> Sales of certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts for shipment to destinations outside the continental United States and such other distribution areas as may be recommended by the Board and established by the Secretary shall be made only by the Board. Any handler desiring to export any part or all of that handler's certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts shall deliver to the Board the certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts to be exported, but the Board shall be obligated to sell in export only such quantities for which it may be able to find satisfactory export outlets. Any hazelnuts so delivered for export which the Board is unable to export shall be returned to the handler delivering them. Sales for export shall be made by the Board only on execution of an agreement to prevent exportation into the area designated in § 982.16. A handler may be permitted to act as an agent of the Board, upon such terms and conditions as the Board may specify, in negotiating export sales, and when so acting shall be entitled to receive a selling commission as authorized by the Board. The proceeds of all export sales, after deducting all expenses actually and necessarily incurred, shall be paid to the handler whose certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts are so sold by the Board.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Other outlets.</E> In addition to the dispositions authorized in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Board may designate such other outlets into which such hazelnuts may be disposed which it determines are noncompetitive with normal market outlets for inshell hazelnuts. Such dispositions shall be made under the direction or supervision of the Board.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Restricted credits.</E> During any marketing year, handlers who dispose of a quantity of eligible hazelnuts in restricted outlets in excess of their restricted obligations, may transfer such excess credits to another handler or <PRTPAGE P="463"/>handlers. Upon a handler's written request to the Board during a marketing year, the Board shall transfer any or all of such excess restricted credits to such other handler or handlers that the handler may designate. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall establish rules and regulations for the transfer of excess restricted credits.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Bonding.</E> Compliance by any handler with the requirements of § 982.50 when restricted hazelnuts may be withheld shall be temporarily deferred to any date requested by the handler, but not later than 60 days prior to the end of the marketing year. Such deferment shall be conditioned upon the voluntary execution and delivery by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking before beginning to handle merchantable hazelnuts during the marketing year. Such written undertaking shall be secured by a bond or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board that on or prior to such date the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted obligation required by § 982.50, subject to any adjustment pursuant to § 982.51.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Bonding requirement.</E> Such bond or bonds shall, at all times during their effective period, be in such amounts that the aggregate thereof shall be no less than the total bonding value of the handler's deferred restricted obligation. The bonding value shall be the deferred restricted obligation poundage multiplied by the applicable bonding rate. The cost of such bond or bonds shall be borne by the handler filing same.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Bonding rate.</E> Said bonding rate shall be an amount per pound as established by the Board. Such bonding rate shall be based on the estimated value of restricted credits for the current marketing year. Until bonding rates for a marketing year are fixed, the rates in effect for the preceding marketing year shall continue in effect. The Board should make any necessary adjustments once such new rates are fixed.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Restricted credit purchases.</E> Any sums collected through default of a handler on the handler's bond shall be used by the Board to purchase restricted credits from handlers, who have such restricted credits in excess of their needs, and are willing to part with them. The Board shall at all times purchase the lowest priced restricted credits offered, and the purchases shall be made from the various handlers as nearly as practicable in proportion to the quantity of their respective offerings of the restricted credits to be purchased.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Unexpended sums.</E> Any unexpended sums which have been collected by the Board through default of a handler on the handler's bond, remaining in the possession of the Board at the end of a marketing year, shall be used to reimburse the Board for its expenses, including administrative and other costs incurred in the collection of such sums, and in the purchase of restricted credits as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfer of restricted credit purchases.</E> Restricted credits purchased as provided for in this section shall be turned over to those handlers who have defaulted on their bonds for liquidation of their restricted obligation. The quantity delivered to each handler shall be that quantity represented by sums collected through default.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Collection upon bonds.</E> Collection upon any defaulted bond shall be deemed a satisfaction of the restricted obligation represented by the collection.</P>

The recommendation of the Board as to the expenses and size of the operating reserve for each such marketing year, together with all data supporting such recommendations, shall be submitted to the Secretary at the beginning of the fiscal year in connection with which such recommendation is made.

                <P>(a) For each marketing year, the Secretary shall fix an assessment rate per pound of hazelnuts handled and withheld, including the creditable weight of ungraded restricted hazelnuts withheld pursuant to § 982.51 and, when subject to regulation pursuant to § 982.45, the inshell equivalent of shelled hazelnuts certified which are produced from other than restricted hazelnuts that will provide sufficient funds to meet the authorized expenses and reserve requirements of the Board. At any time during or after a marketing year when he determines, on the basis of a Board recommendation or other information, that a different rate is necessary, the Secretary may modify the assessment rate and the new rate shall be applicable to all such hazelnuts. Each handler shall pay to the Board on demand, assessments on all such assessable hazelnuts at the rate fixed by the Secretary, less any amounts credited pursuant to § 982.58. The Board shall impose a late payment charge on any handler who fails to pay his assessment within the time prescribed by the Board. In the event the handler thereafter fails to pay the amount outstanding, including the late payment charge, within the prescribed time, the Board shall impose an additional charge in the form of interest on such outstanding amount. The rate of such charges shall be prescribed by the Board, with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(b) In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the Board may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose. Further, payment discounts may be authorized by the Board upon the approval of the Secretary to handlers making such advance assessment payments.</P>

Users interested in purchasing substandard hazelnuts or hazelnut waste must make prior application to the Board on F/H Form D to be included on the approved list of such users. Each handler who disposes of substandard hazelnuts to an approved user shall, upon shipment, report to the Board on F/H Form D1 the quantities disposed of or shipped. Substandard hazelnuts disposed of to an approved user may only be shipped directly to an approved location where the crushing, feed manufacture, or feeding is to take place. The Board may deny approval to any user application, or may remove any user from the approved list when such denial or removal is deemed necessary to ensure control over disposition of substandard hazelnuts. This may occur if the Board determines that substandard hazelnuts are not properly shipped to, or utilized at, approved facilities, in compliance with this requirement. F/H Form D includes the location and description of the disposal facilities to be used as well as a certification to the Board and the Secretary of Agriculture that the applicant will:</P>
              <P>(a) Crush, manufacture feed, or feed to livestock such hazelnuts at the location;</P>
              <P>(b) Use such hazelnuts for no other purpose than for crushing into oil, manufacturing into livestock feed, or livestock feeding;</P>
              <P>(c) Permit such inspection of premises and of hazelnuts received and held, and such examination of books and records covering hazelnut transactions as the Board may require;</P>
              <P>(d) Keep a record of receipts, holdings, and use of substandard hazelnuts available for examination by authorized representatives of the Board and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a period of two years after the end of the marketing year in which the recorded transactions are completed; and</P>
              <P>(e) Make such reports, certified to the Board and the Secretary of Agriculture as to their correctness, as the Board with the approval of the Secretary may require.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Initial members and nomination of successor members.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Nomination of committee members and alternates shall follow the procedure set forth in this section or as may be changed as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial members.</E> Nominations for initial producer and handler members shall be conducted by the Secretary by either holding meetings of handlers and producers, or by mail.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Successor members.</E> Subsequent to the first nomination of committee members under this part, persons to be nominated to serve on the committee as producer or handler members shall be selected pursuant to nomination procedures that shall be established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
                <P>(1) Any qualified individuals who seek nomination as a producer member shall submit to the committee an intent to seek office in one designated district on such form and with such information as the committee shall designate; ballots, accompanied by the names of all such candidates, with spaces to indicate voters' choices and spaces for write-in candidates, together with voting instructions, shall be mailed to all producers who are on record with the committee within the respective districts; the person(s) receiving the highest number of votes shall be the member nominee(s) for that district, and the person(s) receiving the second highest number of votes shall be the alternate member nominee(s). In case of a tie vote, the nominee shall be selected by a drawing.</P>
                <P>(2) Any qualified individuals who seek nomination as a handler member shall submit to the committee an intent to seek office with such information as the committee shall designate; ballots, accompanied by the names of all such candidates, with spaces to indicate voters' choices and spaces for write-in candidates, together with voting instructions, shall be mailed to all handlers who are on record with the committee. For the first handler member seat, the person receiving the highest number of votes shall be the handler member nominee for that seat, and the person receiving the second highest number of votes shall be the alternate member nominee. For the second handler member seat, the person receiving the highest number of votes representing handler volume shall be the handler member nominee for that seat, and the person receiving the second highest number of votes representing handler volume shall be the alternate member nominee. In case of a tie vote, the nominee shall be selected by a drawing.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Handlers.</E> Only handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees of handlers, may participate in the nomination of the two handler member nominees and their alternates. Nomination of the two handler members and their alternates shall be as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) For one handler member nomination, each handler entity shall be entitled to one vote;<PRTPAGE P="478"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) For the second handler member nomination, each handler entity shall be entitled to cast one vote respectively for each ton of assessed weight of pistachios processed by that handler during the two production years preceding the production year in which the nominations are made. For the purposes of nominating handler members and alternates by volume, the assessed weight of pistachios shall be credited to the handler responsible under the order for the payment of assessments of those pistachios. The committee with the approval of the Secretary, may revise the handler representation on the committee if the committee ceases to be representative of the industry.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Producers.</E> Only producers, including duly authorized officers or employees of producers, may participate in the nomination of nominees for producer members and their alternates. Each producer shall be entitled to cast only one vote, whether directly or through an authorized officer or employee, for each position to be filled in the district in which the producer produces pistachios. If a producer is engaged in producing pistachios in more than one district, such producer shall select the district in which to participate in the nomination. If a person is both a producer and a handler of pistachios, such person may participate in both producer and handler nominations, provided, however, that a single member may not hold concurrent seats as both a producer and handler.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Member's affiliation.</E> Not more than two members and not more than two alternate members shall be persons employed by or affiliated with producers or handlers that are affiliated with the same handler and/or producer. Additionally, only one member and one alternate in any one district representing producers and only one member and one alternate representing handlers shall be employed by, or affiliated with the same handler and/or producer. No handler, and all of its affiliated handlers, can be represented by more than one handler member.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Cooperative affiliation.</E> In the case of a producer cooperative, a producer shall not be deemed to be connected in a proprietary capacity with the cooperative notwithstanding any outstanding retains, contributions or financial indebtedness owed by the cooperative to a producer if the producer has not marketed pistachios through the cooperative during the current and one preceding production year. A cooperative that has as its members one or more other cooperatives that are handlers shall not be considered as a handler for the purpose of nominating or voting under this part.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Alternate members.</E> Each member of the committee shall have an alternate member to be nominated in the same manner as the member. Any alternate serving in the same district as a member where both are employed by, or connected in a proprietary capacity with the same corporation, firm, partnership, association, or business organization, shall serve as the alternate to that member. An alternate member, in the absence of the member for whom that alternate is selected shall serve in place of that member on the committee, and shall have and be able to exercise all the rights, privileges, and powers of the member when serving on the committee. In the event of death, removal, resignation, or the disqualification of a member, the alternate shall act as a member on the committee until a successor member is selected and has been qualified.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Selection by Secretary.</E> Nominations under paragraph (g) of this section received by the committee for all handler and producer members and alternate member positions shall be certified and sent to the Secretary at least 60 days prior to the beginning of each two-year term of office, together with all necessary data and other information deemed by the committee to be pertinent or requested by the Secretary. From those nominations, the Secretary shall select the ten producer and handler members of the committee and an alternate for each member.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Acceptance.</E> Each person to be selected by the Secretary as a member or as an alternate member of the committee shall, prior to such selection, qualify by advising the Secretary that if selected, such person agrees to serve in the position for which that nomination has been made.<PRTPAGE P="479"/>
                </P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Failure to nominate.</E> If nominations are not made within the time and manner specified in this part, the Secretary may, without regard to nominations, select the committee members and alternates qualified to serve on the basis of the representation provided for in § 983.41.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Term of office.</E> Selected members and alternate members of the committee shall serve for terms of two years: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That four of the initially selected producer members and one handler member and their alternates shall, by a drawing, be seated for terms of one year so that approximately half of the memberships' terms expire each year. Each member and alternate member shall continue to serve until a successor is selected and has qualified. The term of office shall begin on July 1st of each year. Committee members and alternates may serve up to four consecutive, two-year terms of office. In no event shall any member or alternate serve more than eight consecutive years on the committee. For purposes of determining when a member or alternate has served four consecutive terms, the accrual of terms shall begin following any period of at least twelve consecutive months out of office.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Qualifications.</E> (1) Each producer member and alternate shall be, at the time of selection and during the term of office, a producer or an officer, or employee, of a producer in the district for which nominated.</P>
                <P>(2) Each handler member and alternate shall be, at the time of selection and during the term of office, a handler or an officer or employee of a handler.</P>
                <P>(3) Any member or alternate member who at the time of selection was employed by or affiliated with the person who is nominated, that member shall, upon termination of that relationship, become disqualified to serve further as a member and that position shall be deemed vacant.</P>
                <P>(4) No person nominated to serve as a public member or alternate public member shall have a financial interest in any pistachio growing or handling operation.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Vacancy.</E> Any vacancy on the committee occurring by the failure of any person selected to the committee to qualify as a member or alternate member due to a change in status making the member ineligible to serve, or due to death, removal, or resignation, shall be filled, by a majority vote of the committee for the unexpired portion of the term. However, that person shall fulfill all the qualifications set forth in this part as required for the member whose office that person is to fill. The qualifications of any person to fill a vacancy on the committee shall be certified in writing to the Secretary. The Secretary shall notify the committee if the Secretary determines that any such person is not qualified.</P>
                <P>(n) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may issue rules and regulations implementing §§ 983.41, 983.42 and 983.43.</P>

                <P>Any handler may handle pistachios within the production area free of the requirements in §§ 983.50 through 983.58 and § 983.71 if such pistachios are handled in quantities not exceeding 5,000 dried pounds during any production year. The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may issue rules and regulations changing the 5,000 pound quantity applicable to this exemption.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Maximum level.</E> No handler shall ship for domestic human consumption, pistachios that exceed an aflatoxin level of 15 ppb. All shipments must also be covered by an aflatoxin inspection certificate. Pistachios that fail to meet the aflatoxin requirements shall be disposed in such manner as described in Failed lots/rework procedure of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Change in level.</E> The committee may recommend to the Secretary changes in the aflatoxin level specified in this section. If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such recommendation or other information, that such an adjustment of the aflatoxin level would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, such change shall be made accordingly.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transfers between handlers.</E> Transfers between handlers within the production area are exempt from the aflatoxin regulation of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Aflatoxin testing procedures.</E> To obtain an aflatoxin inspection certificate, each lot to be certified shall be uniquely identified, be traceable from testing through shipment by the handler, and be subjected to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Samples for testing.</E> Prior to testing, each handler shall cause a representative sample to be drawn from each lot (“lot samples”) of sufficient <PRTPAGE P="488"/>weight to comply with Tables 1 and 2 of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) At premises with mechanical sampling equipment (auto-samplers) approved by the USDA Federal-State Inspection Service, samples shall be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Committee and the USDA Federal-State Inspection Service.</P>
              <P>(ii) At premises without mechanical sampling equipment, sampling shall be conducted by or under the supervision of an inspector, or as approved under an alternative USDA-recognized inspection program.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test samples for aflatoxin.</E> Prior to submission of samples to an accredited laboratory for aflatoxin analysis, one sample (“test sample”) shall be created from the pistachios designated for aflatoxin testing in compliance with Tables 1 and 2 of this paragraph for inshell and kernel pistachio lots that weigh up to and including 4,400 pounds. For lot sizes larger than 4,400 pounds, two samples (“test samples”) shall be created equally from the pistachios designated for aflatoxin testing in compliance with the requirements to Tables 1 and 2 of this paragraph. The test samples shall be prepared by, or under the supervision of an inspector, or as approved under an alternative USDA-recognized inspection program. The test samples shall be designated by an inspector as Test Sample #1 and Test Sample #2. Each sample shall be placed in a suitable container, with the lot number clearly identified, and then submitted to an accredited laboratory. The gross weight of the inshell lot sample for aflatoxin testing and the minimum number of incremental samples required are shown in Table 1 of this paragraph. The gross weight of the kernel lot sample for aflatoxin testing and the minimum number of incremental samples required is shown in the Table 2 of this paragraph.</P>

Alternately, the handler may elect to withdraw the lot from testing, rework the lot, and resubmit it for testing after reworking. If the handler directs the laboratory to proceed with the analysis of Test Sample #2, a lot will be certified as negative to aflatoxin and the laboratory shall issue an aflatoxin inspection certificate if the averaged results of Test Sample #1 and Test Sample #2 is at or below 15 ppb.

                <P>(a) Nominations for all grower members shall be submitted by ballot pursuant to an announcement by press releases of the Board to the news media in the walnut producing areas. Such releases shall provide pertinent voting information, including the names of candidates and the location where ballots may be obtained. Ballots shall be accompanied by full instructions as to their markings and mailing and shall include the names of incumbents who are willing to continue serving on the Board and such other candidates as may be proposed pursuant to methods established by the Board with the approval of the Secretary. Each grower, regardless of the number and location of his or her walnut orchard(s), shall be entitled to cast only one ballot in the nomination and each vote shall be given equal weight. If the grower has orchards in both grower districts, he or she shall advise the Board of the district in which he/she desires to vote. The person receiving the highest number of votes for each grower position shall be the nominee.</P>
                <P>(b) Nominations for handler members shall be submitted on ballots mailed by the Board to all handlers in their respective Districts. All handlers' votes shall be weighted by the kernelweight of walnuts certified as merchantable by each handler during the preceding marketing year. Each handler in the production area may vote for handler member nominees and their alternates. However, no handler with less than 35% of the crop shall have more than one member and one alternate member. The person receiving the highest number of votes for each handler member position shall be the nominee for that position.</P>
                <P>(c) A calculation to determine whether or not a handler who handles 35 percent or more of the crop shall be made prior to nominations. For the first nominations held upon implementation of this language, the 35 percent threshold shall be calculated using an average of crop handled for the year in which nominations are made and one year's handling prior. For all future nominations, the 35 percent handling calculation shall be based in the average of the two years prior to the year in which nominations are made. In the event that one handler handles 35% or more of the crop the membership of the Board, nominations shall be as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Nominations of growers who market their walnuts to the handler that handles 35% or more of the crop shall be conducted by that handler and the names of the nominees shall be forwarded to the Board for approval and appointment by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(2) Nominations for the two handler members representing the major handler shall be conducted by the major handler and the names of the nominees shall be forwarded to the Board for approval and appointment by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(3) Nominations on behalf of all other grower members (Groups (b)(4), (5) and (6) of § 984.35) shall be submitted after ballot by such growers pursuant to an announcement by press releases of the Board to the news media in the walnut producing areas. Such releases shall provide pertinent voting information, including the names of candidates and the location where ballots may be obtained. Ballots shall be accompanied by full instructions as to their markings and mailing and shall include the names of incumbents who are willing to continue serving on the Board and such other candidates as may be proposed pursuant to methods established by the Board with the approval of the Secretary. Each grower in Groups (Groups (b)(4), (5) and (6) of § 984.35), regardless of the number and location of his or her walnut orchard(s), shall be entitled to cast only one ballot in the nomination and each vote shall be given equal weight. If the grower has orchard(s) in both grower districts he or she shall advise the Board of the district in which he or she desires to vote. The person receiving the highest number of votes for grower position shall be the nominee.</P>

                <P>(4) Nominations for handler members representing handlers that do not handle 35% or more of the crop shall be submitted on ballots mailed by the Board to those handlers. The votes of these handlers shall be weighted by the <PRTPAGE P="496"/>kernelweight of walnuts certified as merchantable by each handler during the preceding marketing year. Each handler in the production area may vote for handler member nominees and their alternates of this subsection. However, no handler shall have more than one person on the Board either as member or alternate member. The person receiving the highest number of votes for a handler member position of this subsection shall be the nominee for that position.</P>
                <P>(d) Each grower is entitled to participate in only one nomination process, regardless of the number of handler entities to whom he or she delivers walnuts. If a grower delivers walnuts to more than one handler entity, the grower must choose which nomination process he or she participates in.</P>
                <P>(e) The nine members shall nominate one person as member and one person as alternate for the tenth member position. The tenth member and alternate shall be nominated by not less than 6 votes cast by the nine members of the Board.</P>
                <P>(f) Nominations in the foregoing manner received by the Board shall be reported to the Secretary on or before June 15 of each odd-numbered year, together with a certified summary of the results of the nominations. If the Board fails to report nominations to the Secretary in the manner herein specified by June 15 of each odd-numbered year, the Secretary may select the members without nomination. If nominations for the tenth member are not submitted by September 1 of any such year, the Secretary may select such member without nomination.</P>
                <P>(g) The Board may recommend, subject to the approval of the Secretary, a change to these nomination procedures should the Board determine that a revision is necessary.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Free, reserve, and export percentages.</E> Whenever the Secretary finds, on the basis of the Board's recommendation or other information, that limiting the quantity of walnuts that may be handled in domestic markets for merchantable free walnuts during a marketing year will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall establish a free percentage to prescribe the portion of such walnuts which may be handled as free walnuts, and a reserve percentage to prescribe the portion that must be withheld as reserve walnuts. Whenever the Board recommends an export percentage pursuant to § 984.48(a)(7), the Secretary shall establish a percentage if he finds it would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Revision of percentages.</E> (1) On or before February 15 of the marketing year, the Board may recommend that the free percentage be increased and the reserve percentage be decreased. On the basis of the Board's recommendation or other information the Secretary may establish such revisions. If the reserve percentage is reduced when an export percentage is in effect, an increase shall be made in the export percentage so that the quantity previously authorized for export will not be reduced. If the revised reserve quantity is less than the quantity previously authorized for export the export percentage shall be 100 percent. Upon revision, all reserve obligations that are theretofore accrued on merchantable walnuts certified during such year on the basis of the previously effective percentages shall be adjusted accordingly.</P>
                <P>(2) Any time prior to July 1, the Board may recommend an increase in the export percentage, if it finds that there is an insufficient volume of reserve walnuts available for export and additional demand exists, which would not adversely affect the disposition of the oncoming crop. On the basis of the Board's recommendation or other information, the Secretary may establish such revision.</P>

                <P>The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by it during each marketing year for the maintenance and functioning of the Board, and for such other purposes as the Secretary may, pursuant to this part, determine to be appropriate. The Board shall file a proposed budget of expenses and a rate of assessment with the Secretary as soon as practicable after the beginning of each marketing year.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement for payment.</E> Each handler shall pay the Board, on demand, his pro rata share of the expenses authorized by the Secretary for each marketing year. Each handler's pro rata share shall be the rate of assessment per kernelweight pound of walnuts fixed by the Secretary times the kernelweight of merchantable walnuts he has certified. At any time during or after the marketing year the Secretary may increase the assessment rate as necessary to cover authorized expenses and each handler's pro rata share shall be adjusted accordingly.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reserve walnut pool expenses.</E> The Board is authorized temporary use of funds derived from assessments collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to defray expenses incurred in disposing of reserve walnuts pooled. All such expenses shall be deducted from the proceeds obtained by the Board from the sale or other disposal of pooled reserve walnuts.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Accounting.</E> If at the end of a marketing year the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in accordance with one of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, it shall be refunded to handlers from whom collected and each handler's share of such excess funds shall be the amount of assessments he or she has paid in excess of his or her pro rata share of the actual expenses of the Board.</P>
                <P>(2) Excess funds may be used temporarily by the Board to defray expenses of the subsequent marketing year: Provided, That each handler's share of such excess shall be made available to him or her by the Board within five months after the end of the year.</P>

                <P>(3) The Board may carry over such excess into subsequent marketing years as a reserve: Provided, That funds already in reserve do not exceed approximately two years' budgeted expenses. In the event that funds exceed <PRTPAGE P="503"/>two marketing years' budgeted expenses, future assessments will be reduced to bring the reserves to an amount that is less than or equal to two marketing years' budgeted expenses. Such reserve funds may be used:</P>
                <P>(i) To defray expenses, during any marketing year, prior to the time assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses;</P>
                <P>(ii) To cover deficits incurred during any year when assessment income is less than expenses;</P>
                <P>(iii) To defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended;</P>
                <P>(iv) To meet any other such costs recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Advanced assessments and commercial loans.</E> To provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the part of a fiscal period when neither sufficient operating reserve funds nor sufficient revenue from assessments on the current season's certifications are available, the Board may accept payment of assessments in advance or may borrow money from a commercial lending institution for such purposes.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for payment.</E> Each person who first handles salable oil shall pay to the Committee, upon demand, that handler's pro rata share of the expenses authorized by the Secretary for each marketing year. Each handler's pro rata share shall be the rate of assessment fixed by the Secretary times the quantity of oil which the handler handles as the first handler thereof. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee and for such purposes as the Secretary may, pursuant to this subpart, determine to be appropriate, may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of assessment.</E> The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be <PRTPAGE P="515"/>paid by each handler. At any time during or after the marketing year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment as necessary to cover authorized expenses. Such increase shall be applied to all oil handled during the applicable marketing year. In order to provide funds for the administration of this part before sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the Committee may accept advance assessments and may also borrow money for such purpose. Advance assessments received from a handler shall be credited toward assessments levied against the handler during the marketing year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Recommendations for volume regulation.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) If the Committee's marketing policy considerations indicate a need for limiting the quantity of oil of each <PRTPAGE P="516"/>class marketed, the Committee shall recommend to the Secretary a salable quantity and allotment percentage for the ensuing marketing year. Such recommendations shall be made prior to February 15, or such other date as the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish.</P>
                <P>(b) At any time during the marketing year for which the Secretary, pursuant to § 985.52(a), has established a salable quantity and an allotment percentage for each class of oil, the Committee may recommend to the Secretary that such quantity be increased with an appropriate increase in the allotment percentage. Each such recommendation, together with the Committee's reason for such recommendation, shall be submitted promptly to the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(c) As soon as practical following the effective date of this subpart and the organization of the Committee, the Committee may recommend a salable quantity for the 1980-81 marketing year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Issuance of volume regulation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Whenever the Secretary finds, on the basis of the Committee's recommendation or other information, that limiting the total quantity of a class of oil of any crop that handlers may purchase from or handle on behalf of producers during a marketing year, would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, the Secretary shall establish the salable quantity for that oil.</P>
                <FP>The salable quantity shall be prorated among producers by applying an allotment percentage to each producer's allotment base for that class of oil. The allotment percentage shall be established for each class of oil by dividing the salable quantity by the total of all producers' allotment bases for the same class of oil.</FP>
                <P>(b) When an allotment percentage for a class of oil is established for any marketing year, no handler shall purchase from or handle on behalf of producers any oil of that class during such year unless:</P>
                <P>(1) It is, at the time of handling, within the unused portion of a producer's annual allotment, and</P>

                <SUBJECT>Allotment base.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial issuance.</E> Each producer desiring an allotment base for one or more classes of oil shall register with the Committee and furnish to it, on forms provided by the Committee, a report of the number of pounds of each class of oil sold during each of the marketing years of 1977, of 1978, and of 1979, which is the representative base period, and the number of pounds of each class of oil currently available for sale and the location of such oil, the name and address of each handler, the quantity of oil by class sold to each handler, the acreage and location of each year's production of spearmint, and any additional information requested by the Committee. A producer who has changed or changes identity from an individual producer to a partnership or corporate producer, or from a partnership to a corporate or individual producer, or from a corporate to a partnership or individual producer, may for the purpose of establishing the initial and subsequent allotment base, register with the Committee as one and the same person.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Initially, the allotment base for each class of oil shall be established by the Committee for each registered producer, at the option of such producer, as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The average annual number of pounds of oil of that class sold during any two marketing years of the representative base period; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The average annual number of pounds of that class of oil sold during the representative period plus 33<FR>1/3</FR> percent of oil of that class currently available for sale; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The quantity of that class of oil sold during the 1979 marketing year, plus the quantity of that class of oil currently available for sale.</P>

                <P>(2) If a producer has spearmint planted by February 27, 1979, but has no sales history during the representative period, the producer's allotment base shall be established by multiplying its acreage to be harvested for spearmint oil by the average amount of oil per acre sold in the allotment base of other <PRTPAGE P="517"/>producers in the state or area, whichever is more representative, in which the acreage is located: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, the Committee shall review and adjust these allotment bases in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section on the basis of the producer's sales of spearmint oil.</P>
                <P>(c) Periodically, but at least once every five years, the Committee shall review and adjust each producer's allotment base to recognize changes and trends in production and demand. Any such adjustment shall be made in accordance with a formula prescribed by the Committee with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) Beginning with the 1982-83 marketing year, the Committee annually shall make additional allotment bases available for each class of oil in the amount of no more than 1 percent of the total allotment base for that class of oil. Fifty percent of these additional allotment bases shall be made available for new producers and 50 percent made available for existing producers.</P>
                <P>(2) Any person may apply for an additional allotment base for any class of oil by filing an application with the Committee on or before December 1 of the marketing year preceding the marketing year for which the additional allotment bases will be made available.</P>
                <P>(3) The Committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, establish rules and regulations to be used for determining the distribution of additional allotment bases. In establishing such rules, the Committee shall take into account, among other things, the minimum economic enterprise requirements for oil production, the applicant's ability to produce oil, the area where the oil will be produced and other economic and marketing factors.</P>
                <P>(e) The right to each producer receiving an allotment base, or any legal successor in interest, to retain all or part of an allotment base, shall be dependent on continuance to make a bona fide effort to produce the annual allotment referable thereto and failing to do so, such allotment base shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to such unproduced portions.</P>

Each producer's annual allotment for a class of oil shall be determined by multiplying the producer's allotment base for that class of oil by the applicable allotment percentage.</P>
                <P>(b) On or before December 1, the Committee shall furnish each registered holder of an allotment base a form for the producer to apply for an annual allotment for the ensuing marketing year.

The Committee shall notify each producer of the producer's annual allotment for each class of oil within 10 days after the Secretary establishes the salable quantity and allotment percentage.</P>
                <P>(c) Through 1981, a handler may acquire oil of a producer's own production to fulfill a written contract entered into by these two persons prior to February 27, 1979. The terms of this contract shall require the producer to deliver to that handler a specified quantity of a class of oil from that producer's production at a specific price from a specified acreage and produced prior to 1982. The quantity of oil acquired by the handler pursuant to that contract during the 1980-81 or 1981-82 marketing year may exceed the producer's annual allotment for the applicable marketing year, but shall be charged against the producer's annual allotment for that year.</P>

Each handler's share of assessments paid to the Council shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of inshell pecans handled by them as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal year, and the total quantity of inshell pecans handled by all regulated handlers in the production area during the same fiscal year. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Council may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative. Handlers may avail themselves of an inter-handler transfer, as provided for in § 986.62, Inter-handler transfers.</P>
                <P>(b) Based upon a recommendation of the Council or other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of assessment for inshell pecans handled during each fiscal year.

                <P>(c) Upon implementation of this part and subject to the approval of the Secretary, initial assessment rates per classification shall be set within the following prescribed ranges: Native and seedling classified pecans shall be assessed at one-cent to two-cents per pound; improved classified pecans shall be assessed at two-cents to three-cents per pound; and, substandard classified pecans shall be assessed at one-cent to two-cents per pound. These assessment ranges shall be in effect for the initial four years of the order.</P>
                <P>(d) Subsequent assessment rates shall not exceed two percent of the aggregate of all prices in each classification across the production area based on Council data, or the average of USDA reported average price received by growers for each classification, in the preceding fiscal year as recommended by the Council and approved by the Secretary. After four years from the implementation of this part, the Council may recommend, subject to the approval of the Secretary, revisions to this calculation or assessment ranges.</P>
                <P>(e) The Council, with the approval of the Secretary, may revise the assessment rates if it determines, based on information including crop size and value, that the action is necessary, and if the revision does not exceed the assessment limitation specified in this section and is made prior to the final billing of the assessment.</P>

                <P>(f) In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal year, before sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the Council may accept the payment of assessments in advance and may also borrow money for such purposes; <E T="03">Provided</E>, That no loan may amount to more than 50 percent of projected assessment revenue projected for the year in which the loan is secured, and the loan must be repaid within five years.</P>
                <P>(g) If a handler does not pay assessments within the time prescribed by the Council, the assessment may be increased by a late payment charge and/or an interest rate charge at amounts prescribed by the Council with approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(h) On August 31 of each year, every handler warehousing inshell pecans shall be identified as the first handler of those pecans and shall be required to pay the assessed rate on the category of pecans in their possession on that date. The terms of this paragraph may be revised subject to the recommendation of the Council and approval by the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(i) On August 31 of each year, all inventories warehoused by growers from the current fiscal year shall cease to be <PRTPAGE P="536"/>eligible for inter-handler transfer treatment. Instead, such inventory will require the first handler that handles such inventory to pay the assessment thereon in accordance with the prevailing assessment rates at the time of transfer from the grower to the said handler. The terms of this paragraph may be revised subject to the recommendation of the Council and approval by the Secretary.</P>

Each producer, regardless of the number and locations of his date gardens, voting in the nominations for producer members and producer alternate members, shall be entitled to one vote for each member and alternate member position to be filled. The individual receiving the highest number of votes for a position shall be the nominee. Each person voting in the nominations for producer-handler members and producer-handler alternate members, shall be given the opportunity to vote for one member and one alternate member position.

The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may issue rules and regulations on the manner in which nominees for a position may be obtained, polling, balloting, absentee ballots, and the weighting of votes for producer-handler positions when the Committee is restructured during a term of office.</P>

                <P>Marketable dates shall not be handled or otherwise disposed of except as provided in this subpart. This shall not preclude dates of better grades or sizes being handled or otherwise disposed of in any outlet established for dates of lesser grades or sizes. The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may modify the designations specified in § 987.12 to reflect new major outlets and regulatory requirements needed because of changes in marketing conditions. Marketable dates shall include but not be limited to the following: DAC dates, Dates for further processing, Export dates, and Product dates.</P>

                <P>(a) Whenever the Committee finds that the available supply of marketable dates of applicable grade and size available to supply the trade demand for free dates of any variety is likely to be excessive, and that limiting the volume of marketable dates to be handled as free dates through establishment of free and restricted percentages applicable to such variety of such dates would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, it shall recommend such percentages to the Secretary. If the Secretary finds, upon the basis of the Committee's recommendation and supporting data or other information available to him, that the establishment of such percentages would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall establish such percentages. The sum of the free and restricted percentages for any crop year shall equal 100 percent.</P>

                <P>(b) The dates handled by any handler in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined to be that handler's quota fixed by the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="552"/>within the meaning of section 8a(5) of the act.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 987.45</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Withholding restricted dates.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Whenever free and restricted percentages for any variety of dates have been established for a crop year by the Secretary in accordance with § 987.44, each handler shall, at the time of having dates of such variety certified for handling as free dates (including those for further processing that are to be handled as free dates), withhold from handling a quantity of marketable dates of such variety having a weight equal to the restricted percentage for such variety referrable to the dates so far certified. The withholding requirement shall not apply to dates certified for delivery directly to an excess supply removal program of the Secretary. The weight required to be withheld shall be determined by dividing the restricted percentage by the free percentage and applying the resultant withholding factor, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, to the weight of dates so certified. The withholding factor, computed as aforesaid, shall be established by the Secretary. When pitted dates are certified, the weight to be withheld shall be determined by dividing the weight of the pitted dates certified for handling or further processing by a divisor established by the Committee with the approval of the Secretary and applying the withholding factor.</P>
                <P>(b) Compliance by any handler with the withholding of restricted dates may be deferred to any date not later than January 31 of any crop year, upon request to the Committee and when accompanied by a written undertaking that on or prior to such date, he will have fully satisfied his withholding obligation. Such undertaking shall be secured by a bond or bonds to be filed with, and acceptable to, the Committee and with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Committee, running in favor of the Committee and the Secretary in an amount conditioned upon full compliance with such undertaking. The amount shall be determined by multiplying the poundage of the deferred restricted obligation by a bonding rate per pound which would provide funds estimated to be sufficient for the Committee to purchase on the open market a volume of dates equivalent to the deferred obligation. Such bonding rate shall be established annually, and modified as necessary, by the Committee. Any sums collected through default by a handler on his bond shall be used by the Committee to purchase dates to meet the violated restricted obligation, reimburse the Committee for expenses relative to the default, and any excess money remaining shall be refunded to the defaulting handler. The dates so purchased by the Committee shall be turned over to the defaulting handler for disposition as restricted dates. In the event the Committee is unable to purchase a poundage of dates equal to the defaulted volume, the sums collected shall, after reimbursement of Committee expenses in connection with the default, be distributed among all handlers other than the defaulting handler in proportion to the volume of certified dates handled as free dates (including those for further processing that were handled as free dates), during the crop year in which the default occurred.</P>

                <P>(c) At any time during the crop year free dates may be inspected and certified for handling or for further processing as provided in § 987.41. Dates so certified shall, at the time of certification, be identified by appropriate seals, stamps, or tags to be furnished by the Committee and to be affixed to the containers by the handler under the direction and supervision of the Committee or its designated inspectors. The assessment requirements in § 987.72 as well as the withholding obligation prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section shall be met at the time of certification. However, a handler who has had more free dates certified for handling or further processing than he subsequently shipped or otherwise handled may, upon request to the Committee and with its approval, have any of such excess quantity of the certified dates suspended from certification of record or, if damaged or the outlet changed, removed from certification, and his withholding and assessment obligations adjusted accordingly. A handler, who has had dates certified for <PRTPAGE P="553"/>handling or further processing and has not had them so suspended from certification of record or removed from certification, may carry such certified free dates over into the new crop year and need not pay the assessment nor meet the requirements of any withholding percentages established for such year.</P>

                <P>(d) Dates withheld to meet the withholding obligation shall be stored at the expense of the handler, in storage of his own choosing and disposed of in accordance with § 987.55. All such dates shall be inspected and identified by appropriate seals, stamps, or tags to be furnished by the Committee and to be affixed to the containers by the handler under the direction and supervision of the Committee or its designated inspectors. All withholding and movement of restricted dates, shall be subject to the supervision and accounting control of the Committee and reports shall be filed as required by this part. Any handler who during a crop year disposes in restricted outlets of a quantity of marketable dates in excess of his withholding obligation of such year may: (1) On written request delivered to the Committee not later than September 30 of such crop year have a part or all of such excess transferred, by the Committee, to such other handler or handlers as he may name, for crediting such other handlers' withholding obligations incurred in that crop year; and in addition (2) have a part or all of the remainder of such excess credited to his restricted obligation of the subsequent crop year: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the amount of any such credit shall not exceed that established by the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, as the percentage of such withholding obligation.</P>
                <P>(e) On request to the Committee and with its approval, a handler may, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and any applicable rules and regulations which the Committee may prescribe with the approval of the Secretary, defer until any date not later than September 30 of the crop year the meeting of any portion of his obligation to withhold restricted dates by setting aside such amount of graded dates as will assure a quantity of marketable dates equal at least to the quantity needed to be withheld to meet his withholding obligation. With respect to any such dates the handler may set aside in connection with such a deferment, the Committee may require, if it deems it necessary, the handler to have made, at his own expense, such inspection as may be necessary for a determination as to whether such dates conform to the applicable requirements for dates that may be set aside under this paragraph. As a condition to the Committee approving the deferment, the handler shall agree in writing that:</P>
                <P>(1) He will adequately mark and identify the set-aside graded dates as such and hold them separate and apart from other dates;</P>
                <P>(2) The graded dates will not be removed from the stacks in which so set aside without the prior written permission of the Committee;</P>
                <P>(3) Inspection of the dates by the Committee will be permitted at any reasonable time; and</P>
                <P>(4) If the quantity, quality, or size of the set-aside dates is found by the Committee at any time to be deficient, the handler will promptly set aside such additional or substitute quantity of graded dates as is necessary to correct the deficiency.</P>

                <P>(f) Upon the Committee prescribing, with the approval of the Secretary, minimum standards for inspection of field-run dates and appropriate administrative rules and regulations, a handler may, in accordance therewith and the provisions of this paragraph, satisfy all or any part of his obligation to withhold restricted dates by setting aside field-run dates or by disposing of field-run dates in outlets prescribed in, or pursuant to, § 987.56. The field-run dates shall be of such quality or size as shall be prescribed in such rules and regulations. The setting aside, direct disposal, and disposal of any field-run dates set aside shall occur prior to September 30 of the crop year in which the withholding obligation occurs. Prior to the disposal or setting aside of the field run dates, the handler shall have had them inspected to determine the weight of dates eligible to satisfy withholding obligation. Upon such disposal or setting aside of the field-run dates, <PRTPAGE P="554"/>the handler shall be credited with satisfaction of his restricted obligation to the extent of the eligible weight of dates. In permitting the handler to so satisfy his withholding obligation the Committee shall require the handler to agree in writing that:</P>
                <P>(1) Any field-run dates set aside will be held separate and apart from other dates and appropriately marked;</P>
                <P>(2) Such dates will not be removed from the stacks in which so set aside for substitution of other dates, disposition, or for any other reason without prior written permission of the Committee; and</P>
                <P>(3) Inspection of said dates by the Committee will be permitted at any reasonable time. In order to satisfy a withholding obligation by direct disposal of field-run dates into cull outlets, the disposal shall be under the supervision of the Committee and through persons on a Committee approved list of feeders and manufacturers. The handler may, upon giving prior notice to the Committee of any of the following proposed actions with respect to field-run dates withheld and obtaining its approval, (i) dispose of any such set-aside, field-run dates in the same manner as provided for direct disposal (ii) grade such dates and have the graded dates certified as marketable dates and withhold or dispose of such marketable dates as restricted dates, or (iii) substitute for the set-aside, field-run dates an equivalent quantity of marketable dates which he shall withhold or dispose of as restricted dates.</P>

Upon any revision in the free and restricted percentages the control obligation of each handler with respect to free dates handled or certified for handling or for further processing by him for the entire crop year shall be recomputed in accordance with such revised control percentages. The handler shall be permitted to select, insofar as practicable, under the supervision and direction of the Committee, the particular dates to be removed from any dates withheld.</P>

Surplus dates delivered to the Committee shall be disposed of by it, in those outlets specified in § 987.56, at the best prices attainable and the proceeds returned pro rata, after deduction of Committee costs, to equity holders. The Committee may assist handlers with the cleaning, storage, or delivery of surplus dates and may, with the approval of the Secretary, establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to administration of this regulation.</P>

                <P>The Committee is authorized to incur such expenses, including maintenance of an operating reserve fund, as the Secretary may find are reasonable and are likely to be incurred by it during each crop year for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee and for such other purposes as he determines to be appropriate. The recommendation of the Committee as to total expenses and allocation thereof for each crop year, together with all data supporting such recommendation, shall be submitted to the Secretary within a reasonable time after the marketing policy for each crop year is recommended.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement for payment.</E> Each handler shall pay to the Committee upon demand, on all dates he has certified as meeting the requirements for marketable dates and utility dates utilized in product outlets including the eligible portion of any field-run dates certified and set aside or disposed of pursuant to § 987.45(f), his pro rata share of all expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Committee during each crop year. Should the condition arise wherein the utility portion of dates handled in certain other outlets should not be, in the opinion of the Committee, subject to the payment of assessments on that portion, the Committee may recommend and the Secretary approve by rulemaking, such exclusion. Each handler's pro rata share shall be the rate of assessment per hundredweight fixed by the Secretary. At any time during or after a crop year the Secretary may increase such assessment rate to secure sufficient funds to cover unanticipated expenses or a deficit in assessable poundage. Any such increase shall apply to all assessable poundage of the crop year. The Committee may accept payments of assessments in advance and may borrow money in any amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated expenses set forth in its budget for the then crop year. The assessment weight of pitted dates shall be determined by dividing the weight of such dates by a divisor established by the Committee with the approval of the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Delinquent payments.</E> Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by the Committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest, and late payment charge shall be as recommended by the Committee and approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Surplus expenses.</E> The Committee is authorized to use temporarily funds derived from assessments collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to defray expenses incurred in disposing of surplus dates. All such expenses shall be deducted from the proceeds obtained by the Committee from such disposal.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Operating reserve.</E> The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish and maintain during one or more crop years an operating monetary reserve in an amount not to exceed the average of one year's expenses incurred during the most recent five preceding crop years, except that an established reserve need not be reduced to conform to any recomputed average. Funds in reserve shall be available for use by the Committee for expenses authorized pursuant to § 987.71.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Refunds.</E> Funds held by the Committee at the conclusion of the crop year in excess of the crop year's expenses, including reserve requirements, may be used to defray expenses for no more than the ensuing four months, and thereafter within a reasonable time the Committee shall credit, or upon demand, refund the aforesaid excess to handlers who contributed to such excess: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the excess due any handler may be applied, in whole or in part, by the Committee to any outstanding obligation due the Committee from such handler. A handler's share of the excess funds shall be the amount of assessments he paid in excess of his actual pro rata share of <PRTPAGE P="559"/>the expenses, including reserve requirements, of the Committee for the preceding crop year. Upon termination of this subpart any money in possession of the Committee shall be distributed in such manner as the Secretary may direct: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, to the extent practicable, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</P>

Dates of each outlet category shall be held, stored, or shiped in a manner to preserve their identity. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the markings on the containers shall be not less than five-sixteenths (<FR>5/16</FR>) inch in height on containers exceeding 5 pounds net weight and not less than one-eighth (<FR>1/8</FR>) inch in height on smaller containers.

If the dates, including fieldrun dates with cull dates removed, are certified as meeting the grade and size requirements for export to approved countries other than Mexico, the containers shall be marked “Export”. Dry dates for processing packed for shipment to approved countries shall be marked “Export Dry”. Dates packed for export to Mexico shall be marked “Export Mexico”. However, “Export Mexico” shall be in letters not less than three-fourths (<FR>3/4</FR>) inch in height on containers exceeding 5 pounds net weight, and not less than one-eighth (<FR>1/8</FR>) inch in height on smaller containers. DAC dates and FP dates, marked pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c), respectively, of this section, may be exported without change of marking.</P>

                <P>(a) In lieu of the minimum standards prescribed in § 987.39, the following standards are prescribed as the minimum grades and sizes for marketable dates to be handled in the applicable outlets. These standards shall continue in effect irrespective of whether the season average price to producers for dates is or is not in excess of the parity level specified in section 2(1) of the act.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">DAC dates.</E> (1) All varieties of DAC dates may be handled in the United States, Canada, or any other outlet established for dates of lesser grades or sizes.</P>

                <P>(2) DAC dates of any variety shall at least meet the requirements of U.S. Grade B, except that up to 25 percent, by weight, of the dates may possess semi-dry of dry calyx ends, but not more than 5 percent, by weight, of the dates may possess dry calyx ends. Also, with respect to whole dates of the Deglet Noor variety, the individual <PRTPAGE P="562"/>dates in the sample from the lot shall weigh at least 6.5 grams, but up to 10 percent, by weight, may weigh less than 6.5 grams, except beginning February 21, 1997, and ending October 31, 1997, the 10 percent tolerance shall be increased to 15 percent. These size requirements are in addition to, and do not supersede, the requirements as to uniformity of size prescribed in the grade standards.</P>

                <P>(3) DAC dates of any variety, when packed in plastic containers, other than bags and master shipping containers, shall contain a net weight (i) for whole dates, of either eight ounces, twelve ounces, 1 pound 8 ounces, or two pounds or more, and (ii) for pitted dates, of either seven ounces, ten ounces, one pound, one pound eight ounces, or two pounds or more. DAC dates packed in other than plastic containers may be handled without regard to the net weight content. For the purpose of this subparagraph, <E T="03">plastic container</E> means any containers of any shape made from plastic and in which dates are packed without the use of cardboard boats, trays, or other like stiffening material: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That DAC dates shipped for sale in Canada in plastic containers are exempt from the net weight requirements of this subparagraph.</P>
                <P>(4) The California Date Administrative Committee may designate with the approval of the Secretary such other types and sizes of containers for testing in connection with a research project conducted by or in cooperation with the Committee. The time period and the quantity of dates which may be marketed by handlers during that period shall be designated by the Committee for each market research project. The handling of each lot of dates in such test containers shall be subject to the prior approval, and under the supervision, of the Committee.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Dates for further processing.</E> (1) Except as provided in § 987.152(b)(1), all varieties of FP dates may be disposed of only (i) to persons in the United States capable of processing and packing the dates and having them certified as DAC dates, or (ii) exported to the countries designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Credit for excess disposition in restricted outlets.</E> Disposition of marketable dates in restricted outlets in excess of a handler's withholding obligation may be: (1) Transferred pursuant to § 987.45 upon such handler filing a completed CDAC Form No. 14 with the Committee, or (2) credited to the handler's withholding obligation of the following crop year so long as the excess disposition exceds 199 pounds. However, the quantity so credited shall never exceed 40 percent of the handler's withholding obligation of the crop year in which the excess disposition occurred and 100 percent of the withholding obligation incurred by him during October through December of the crop year following the crop year in which such excess disposition occurred. All such crediting or accumulation shall be contingent upon the Committee receiving, in due course, confirmation that the dates were disposed of in eligible restricted outlets. With respect to exports, the withholding credit shall be granted upon the Committee receiving notification from the inspection service, and in due course a copy of the on board bill of lading or other documentary evidence satisfactory to the Committee.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">FP dates.</E> Withholding obligations on FP dates shall be based on the weight of such dates when they are inspected and certified. However, if such dates are subsequently processed and packed within the area of production, the withholding obligation shall be adjusted to reflect any increase in weight.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Dates for deferment of withholding.</E> Any handler may defer his certification and withholding or disposition of restricted dates by pledging a comparable volume of graded or field-run dates as a surety that he will meet his withholding obligation at a later date. Such deferment shall not be effective until: (1) The handler files with the Committee a CDAC Form No. 12 to set aside graded dates or CDAC Form No. 13 to set aside field-run dates; and (2) the pledged dates are set aside as a lot and identified by the handler as “Restricted” and as “Graded” or “Field-Run”, as appropriate, and as to the number of containers, the date of set-aside and whether or not the dates have been inspected. If the handler sets aside field-run dates or disposes of field-run dates in outlets prescribed in or pursuant to § 987.56 to obtain withholding credit for the sound date portion in the lot, the field-run dates shall meet the requirements prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section for eligible field-run dates, as determined by the inspection service.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Identification of restricted dates.</E> Any lot of restricted dates not immediately disposed of through exportation to countries approved by the Committee or directed to approved product outlets shall be stored as a lot separate from all other dates and in a specified location with a USDA inspection service tag marked “Restricted”.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Field-run dates.</E> Field-run dates set aside for the purpose of deferring or meeting any part or all of a withholding obligation shall consist of at least 70 percent, by weight, of sound dates but may contain 10 percent, by weight, of cull dates of which not more than 5 percent may be hidden culls—i.e., dates with internal defects including souring, mold, fermentation, insect infestation, or foreign material.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Substitution.</E> Any handler may, under the direction and supervision of the Committee or the inspection service, substitute for any quantity of restricted dates held by him a like quantity of dates of the same variety and of the same or more recent year's production which have been certified and identified as meeting the requirements for restricted dates.</P>

Prior to making a determination to remove a date product manufacturer from the approved date product manufacturer list, the committee shall notify such manufacturer in writing of its intention and the reasons for removal. The committee shall allow the date product manufacturer an opportunity to respond. In the event that a date product manufacturer's name has been removed from the list of approved date product manufacturers, a new application must be submitted to the committee and the applicant must await approval.</P>

The interest charge shall be a rate of one and one half percent per month, and shall be applied to the unpaid assessment balance for the number of days all or any part of the unpaid balance is delinquent beyond the 60-day payment period.</P>
                <P>(c) In addition to the interest charge specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the committee shall impose a late payment charge on any handler whose payment has not been received in the committee's office, or the envelope containing the payment legibly postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, within 60 days of the invoice date. The late payment charge shall be 10 percent of the unpaid balance.</P>

                <P>A Raisin Administrative Committee is hereby established consisting of 47 members of whom 35 shall represent producers, 10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association(s) and 1 shall be a public member. The producer members shall be selected as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) Producer members representing the cooperative marketing association(s) shall be members of such association(s) engaged in the handling of raisins, each of which acquired not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year, and those members shall be equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, obtained by multiplying 35 by the ratio the cooperative marketing association(s) raisin acquisitions are to the acquisitions of all handlers during the preceding crop year.</P>

                <P>(b) Producer members representing cooperative bargaining association(s) shall be members of such associations, and the number of those members shall be equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, obtained by multiplying 35 by the ratio the raisins acquired by handlers from bargaining <PRTPAGE P="574"/>association members are to the total acquisitions of all handlers during the preceding crop year.</P>
                <P>(c) All other producer members who shall not be members of a cooperative bargaining association(s), cooperative marketing association(s) engaged in the handling of raisins which acquired 10 percent or more of the total acquisitions during the preceding crop year, nor sold for cash to cooperative marketing association(s), shall represent all producers not defined in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and shall be selected in the number and, when appropriate, for the districts as designated in the rules and regulations.</P>
                <P>(d) The handler members shall be divided into two groups and include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Handler members shall be selected from and represent cooperative marketing association(s) engaged in the handling of raisins each of which acquired not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year, and the number of those members shall be equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, obtained by multiplying 10 by the ratio of the cooperative marketing association(s) raisin acquisitions are to the total acquisitions of all handlers during the preceding crop year.</P>
                <P>(2) The remaining handler members shall be selected from and represent all other handlers, which would include all independent handlers and small cooperative marketing association(s) who acquired less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Handler nominees for this group shall be nominated by all handlers in the group in a manner determined by the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, and specified in the rules and regulations.</P>
                <P>(e) The “cooperative” bargaining association'(s) member shall be selected from the cooperative bargaining association(s). The public member shall be nominated by the Committee and selected by the Secretary as public member.</P>
                <P>(f) For each member of the Committee there shall be an alternate member who shall have the same qualifications as the member for whom he is an alternate.</P>

In the event any such nominee is engaged as a producer in more than one district, such producer may be a nominee for only one district. One or more producers may be nominated for each such producer member or alternate member position.</P>
                <P>(ii) Each such producer whose name is offered in nomination for producer member positions to represent on the Committee independent producers or producers who are affiliated with cooperative marketing association(s) handling less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year shall be given the opportunity to provide the Committee a short statement outlining qualifications and desire to serve if selected.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Regulation.</E> No handler shall acquire or receive natural condition raisins which fail to meet such minimum grade, quality, and condition standards as the Committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, in applicable rules and regulations: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That a handler may receive raisins for inspection, may receive off-grade raisins for reconditioning and may receive or acquire off-grade raisins for use in eligible non-normal outlets: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That a handler may acquire natural condition raisins which exceed the tolerance established for maturity under a weight dockage system established pursuant to rules and regulations recommended by the Committee and approved by the Secretary. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall apply to the acquisition or receipt of natural condition raisins of a particular varietal type for which minimum grade, quality, and condition standards are not applicable or then in effect pursuant to this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Changes in minimum grade, quality, and condition standards for natural condition raisins.</E> The Committee may recommend to the Secretary changes in the minimum grade, quality, and condition standards for natural condition raisins of any varietal type and may recommend to the Secretary that minimum grade, quality, and condition standards for any varietal type be added to or deleted. The Committee shall submit with its recommendation all data and information upon which it acted in making its recommendation, and such other information as the Secretary may request. The Secretary shall approve any such change if he finds, upon the basis of data submitted to him by the Committee or from other pertinent information available to him, that to do so would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Publicity and notice.</E> The Committee shall give prompt and reasonable publicity to producer, dehydrators, and handlers of each recommendation submitted by it to the <PRTPAGE P="580"/>Secretary and of each regulation issued by the Secretary. Notice of such regulation shall be given to all handlers by registered or certified mail.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Inspection and certification.</E> (1) Each handler shall cause an inspection and certification to be made of all natural condition raisins acquired or received by him, except with respect to:</P>
                <P>(i) An inter-plant or inter-handler transfer of off-grade raisins as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, unless such inspection and certification are required by rules and procedures made effective pursuant to this amended subpart;</P>
                <P>(ii) An inter-plant or inter-handler transfer of standard raisins as described in § 989.59(e);</P>
                <P>(iii) Raisins received from a dehydrator which have been previously inspected pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section;</P>
                <P>(iv) Any raisins for which minimum grade, quality, and condition standards are not then in effect;</P>
                <P>(v) Raisins received from a cooperative bargaining association which have been inspected and are in compliance with requirements established pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and</P>

                <P>(vi) Any raisins, if permitted in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Committee may establish with the approval of the Secretary, acquired or received for disposition in eligible non-normal outlets. Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior to blending raisins, acquiring raisins, storing raisins, reconditioning raisins, or acquiring raisins which have been reconditioned, each handler shall obtain an inspection certification showing whether or not the raisins meet the applicable grade, quality, and condition standards: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the initial inspection for infestation shall not be required if the raisins are fumigated in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Committee shall establish with the approval of the Secretary. The handler shall submit or cause to be submitted to the Committee a copy of such certification, together with such other documents or records as the Committee may require. Such certification shall be issued by inspectors of the Specialty Crops Inspection Division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, unless the Committee determines, and the Secretary concurs in such determination, that inspection by another agency would improve the administration of this amended subpart. The Committee may require that raisins held on memorandum receipt be re-inspected and certified as a condition for their acquisition by a handler.</P>
                <P>(2) The Committee may, in accordance with rules and procedures established with the approval of the Secretary, authorize handlers to receive or acquire natural condition raisins which have been produced by any dehydrator by dehydrating grapes by artificial means and have been inspected and certified on his premises. In the event there shall have been compliance with Committee requirements, any handler who receives or acquires such inspected and certificated raisins shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to inspection and certification of natural condition raisins received or acquired by him.</P>
                <P>(3) The Committee may, in accordance with rules and the procedures established with the approval of the Secretary, authorize handlers to receive or acquire without further inspection and certification, natural condition raisins, standard or off-grade, which have been inspected, certified and held, in compliance with Committee requirements, at a receiving station of a cooperative bargaining association.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Off-grade raisins.</E> (1) Any natural condition raisins tendered to a handler which fail to meet the applicable minimum grade, quality, and condition standards may:</P>
                <P>(i) Be received or acquired by the handler for disposition, without further inspection, in eligible non-normal outlets;</P>
                <P>(ii) Be returned unstemmed to the person tendering the raisins; or</P>

                <P>(iii) Be received by the handler for reconditioning. Off-grade raisins received by a handler under any one of the three described categories may be changed to any other of the categories under such rules and procedures as the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall establish. No handler <PRTPAGE P="581"/>shall ship or otherwise dispose of off-grade raisins which he does not return to the tenderer, transfer to another handler as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or recondition so that they at least meet the minimum standards prescribed in or pursuant to this amended subpart, except into eligible non-normal outlets.</P>
                <P>(2) Off-grade raisins may be transferred from the plant of the handler where received to another plant of his or to that of another handler within the State of California under such rules and procedures as the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall establish to safeguard the objectives of this part.</P>
                <P>(3) Each handler shall, while holding any off-grade raisins, store them separate and apart from other raisins and the off-grade raisins shall be stored in accordance with disposition and reconditioning categories. The Committee with the approval of the Secretary may prescribe rules and procedures for the storage of the raisins.</P>
                <P>(4) If the handler is to acquire the raisins after they are reconditioned, his obligation with respect to such raisins shall be based on the weight of the raisins (if stemmed, adjusted to natural condition weight) after they have been reconditioned.</P>
                <P>(5) The Committee shall establish, with the approval of the Secretary, such additional rules and procedures as may be necessary to insure adequate control of off-grade raisins, including, but not limited to, the reconditioning of off-grade raisins, the disposition and use of unsuccessfully reconditioned raisins, and the disposition and use of residual matter from reconditioning operations.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Blending.</E> No handler shall blend raisins except: (1) Incidental to reconditioning raisins as permitted under rules and procedures established by the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary; (2) blending standard raisins with standard raisins; or (3) blending raisins which meet the minimum grade standards for packed raisins with other raisins which meet such standards.</P>

Such handler shall obtain a certificate that such raisins meet the aforementioned applicable minimum standards and shall submit or cause to be submitted to the Committee a copy of such certificate together with such other documents or records as the Committee may require. The certificate shall be issued by the Specialty Crops Inspection Division of the United States Department of Agriculture, unless the Committee determines, and the Secretary concurs in such determination, that inspection by another agency will improve the administration of this amended subpart.

                <P>The Committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by it during each crop year, for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee and for such purposes as he may, pursuant to this subpart, determine to be appropriate. The funds to cover such expenses shall be obtained levying assessments as provided in § 989.80. The Committee shall file with the Secretary for each crop year a proposed budget of these expenses and a proposal as to the assessment rate to be fixed pursuant to § 989.80, together with a report thereon. Such filing shall be not later than October 5 of the crop year, but this date may be extended by the Committee not more than 5 days if warranted by a late crop.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Each handler shall pay to the Committee, upon demand, his pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be incurred, as aforesaid, by the Committee during each crop year less any amounts credited pursuant to § 989.53. Such handler's pro rata share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total raisin tonnage acquired by such handler during the applicable crop year and the total raisin tonnage acquired by all handlers during the same crop year.</P>
                <P>(b) Each handler who reconditions off-grade raisins but does not acquire the standard raisins recovered therefrom shall, with respect to his assessable portion of all such standard raisins, pay to the Committee, upon demand, his pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be incurred by the Committee each crop year. Such handler's pro rata share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the handler's assessable portion (which shall be a quantity equal to such handler's standard raisins which are acquired by some other handler or handlers) during the applicable crop year and the total raisin tonnage acquired by all handlers.</P>

                <P>(c) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by all handlers on the basis of a specified rate per ton. At any time during or after a crop year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment to obtain sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses of the Committee. Each handler shall pay such additional assessment to the Committee upon demand. In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the Committee, the Committee may <PRTPAGE P="586"/>accept advance payments from any handler to be credited toward such assessments as may be levied pursuant to this section against such handler during the crop year. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee, and for such purposes as the Secretary may pursuant to this subpart determine to be appropriate, may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.</P>

                <P>(d) Each handler shall, with respect to administrative assessments not paid within 30 calendar days of the date of the Committee's invoice, pay to the Committee interest on the unpaid assessment at the rate of the prime rate established by the bank in which the Committee has its administrative assessment funds deposited, on the day that the administrative assessment becomes delinquent plus 2 percent; and further, that such rate of interest be added to the bill monthly until the delinquent handler's assessment plus applicable interest has been paid: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, modify the interest rate applicable to delinquent handler's assessment through the establishment of applicable rules and regulations.</P>

                <P>Any person (defined in § 989.3 as an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other business unit) who is engaged, in a proprietary capacity, in the production of grapes which are sun-dried or dehydrated by artificial means to produce raisins and who qualifies under the provisions of § 989.29(b)(2) shall be eligible to cast one ballot for a nominee for each producer member position and one ballot for a nominee for each producer alternate member position on the committee which is to be filled for his district. Such person must be the one who or which: Owns and farms land resulting in his or its ownership of such grapes produced thereon; rents and farms land, resulting in his or its ownership of all or a portion of such grapes produced thereon; or owns land which he or it does not farm and, as rental for such land, obtains the ownership of a portion of such grapes or the raisins. In this connection, a partnership shall be deemed to include two or more persons (including a husband and wife) with respect to land the title to which, or leasehold interest in which, is vested in them as tenants in common, joint tenants, or under community property laws, as community property. In a landlord-tenant relationship, wherein each of the parties is a producer, each such producer shall be entitled to one vote for a nominee for each producer member position and one vote for each producer alternate member position.

                <P>(a) Any raisins produced from grapes grown outside the State of California that are received by a handler shall be observed and marked for identification by an inspector. As provided in § 989.173(b)(7), the inspection service may request information needed to properly mark such raisins for identification; it shall be the handler's responsibility to arrange for such identification and furnish required documentation promptly.</P>

                <P>(b) In the absence of an inspector to observe and mark such raisins for identification, the handler shall not permit the unloading to occur unless the handler has a written statement from the inspection service that an inspector cannot be furnished within a reasonable time: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That raisins so unloaded shall be observed and marked properly upon an inspector being available.</P>
                <P>(c) The handler shall notify the inspection service in writing at least one business day in advance of the time such handler plans to begin receiving raisins produced from grapes grown outside the State of California, unless a shorter period is acceptable to the inspection service.</P>
                <P>(d) Raisins produced from grapes grown outside of the State of California and received by a handler shall be marked for identification by the inspector affixing to one container on each pallet or to each bin in each lot a prenumbered RAC control card (to be furnished by the Committee) which shall remain affixed until the raisins are processed and disposed of or disposed of as natural condition raisins. The cards shall be removed only by an inspector of the inspection service or authorized Committee personnel.</P>
                <P>(e) Each handler shall store raisins produced from grapes grown outside the State of California separate and apart from all other raisins held by such handler to the satisfaction of the Committee. Storage of such raisins shall be deemed “separate and apart” if the containers are marked as raisins produced from grapes grown outside the State of California and placed so as to be readily and clearly identified.</P>
                <P>(f) Any raisins received by a handler produced from grapes grown outside the State of California shall be processed and/or disposed of under the surveillance of the inspection service.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Incoming inspection.</E> (1)(i) The Committee shall, upon request of a handler who complies with the requirements of this part with respect to inspection points, designate as his inspection point any place (including his plant or receiving station) where the handler receives raisins.</P>

                <P>(ii) Each handler shall, at his expense, provide at each of his inspection <PRTPAGE P="593"/>points reasonably safe and adequate facilities for receiving raisins, drawing samples, and efficient inspection of natural condition raisins. At the time of inspection of any lot, the handler shall, at his expense, provide the inspector with any assistance necessary in the inspection of the raisins, including the movement of individual containers. Each handler, other than a processor, shall maintain with the Committee a current written description, defining the boundaries and other pertinent details, of each of his inspection points. In the event the Committee determines that any inspection point, or any modification thereof, does not comply with the definition or the requirements of this part, it shall notify the handler of the changes necessary for compliance. The handler shall make such changes promptly. In the event any of his inspection points is the same as that of another handler or person receiving raisins or grapes in any form, the handler shall maintain his raisins separate and apart from any other raisins.</P>
                <P>(iii) The weight of each lot of raisins tendered for receiving, storage, reconditioning, acquisition, or disposition shall be substantiated by an official “State Certificate of Weights and Measures” issued by a public weighmaster, whether located at the inspection point or otherwise, or such other document approved by the Committee which accurately reflects the weight of each lot tendered. The net weight of such raisins for the purposes of this part, shall be determined by deducting the sand tare and box tare from the gross weight of the raisins. The sand tare shall be the weight of the sand and other foreign material removed from the raisins by passing the raisins over a screen (of a type commonly used by the industry for such purpose) having 36 square openings to the square inch, with each opening being one-eighth of an inch square.</P>

                <P>(2) No handler, other than a processor, shall receive at points other than at an inspection point, natural condition raisins from a tenderer, either for acquisition, storage, reconditioning, inspection, or for disposition in eligible non-normal outlets: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That this requirement shall not preclude a handler from dehydrating, free from the provisions of this part, at separate dehydrating facilities recognized in § 989.105 and located in California, raisins not delivered to an inspection point. Any handler who accepts raisins at an inspection point for drying or other reconditioning shall be deemed to have received the raisins for reconditioning and shall be subject to the provisions of this part with respect to such raisins.</P>

                <P>(3) For each lot of natural condition raisins received by a handler for acquisition, reconditioning, storage, inspection, or for disposition in eligible non-normal outlets, the handler shall, immediately upon physical receipt and tentative acceptance thereof, issue a prenumbered (numbered serially in advance) door receipt or weight certificate showing the name and address of the tenderer, the weight of the lot, the number and type of containers in the lot, and any other information necessary to identify the lot. For the purposes of identifying incoming lots of raisins, other than dehydrated raisins covered by paragraph (e) of this section, a handler, if it is impracticable for him to issue immediately a door receipt or weight certificate, may issue for temporary use only a prenumbered “Request for USDA Inspection” on a form furnished by the Committee. Any such raisins so received by a handler shall, prior to their acceptance, be inspected at an inspection point during the unloading process, and if certified as standard raisins shall be, unless returned to the tenderer, either promptly acquired by the handler or received for storage on memorandum receipt: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in the absence of an inspector to perform inspection during unloading, the handler shall not permit unloading to occur unless such absence is during normal business hours and the handler has a written statement from the inspection service to the effect that inspection cannot be furnished within a reasonable time: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That the raisins so unloaded shall be inspected promptly upon an inspector being available. It shall be the handler's responsibility in any case to arrange for the inspection, other than with respect to dehydrated raisins covered by paragraph (e) of this <PRTPAGE P="594"/>section, and furnish weight certificates promptly. Any raisins received by a handler as off-grade for disposition in eligible non-normal outlets or for reconditioning may be accepted uninspected: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That an application for receiving such uninspected raisins shall be submitted by the handler, on a form furnished by the Committee, to the Inspection Service prior to, or upon physical receipt of, such off-grade raisins. Such form shall provide for at least the name and address of the tenderer (equity holder), date, number, and type of containers, net weight of the raisins, and the particular defect(s) the handler indicates would cause the raisins to be off-grade. Handlers shall complete and sign the form. The application for such uninspected raisins shall not be acceptable unless signed by the tenderer. The uninspected raisins shall be subject to surveillance by the Inspection Service. Each lot of raisins accepted by a handler for reconditioning shall be reconditioned separately from any other lot.</P>
                <P>(4) If any lot of natural condition raisins tendered to a handler is separated into two or more lots because a portion of the original lot failed to meet minimum grade and condition standards, or because the entire lot failed due to more than one defect, the handler shall issue a prenumbered weight certificate for each such new lot not returned to the tenderer, showing the name and address of the tenderer, the weight of the lot, and the number and type of containers in the lot. The weight of any meeting lot shall be determined by weighing it, or by weighing the failing portion of the incoming lot and deducting the weight thereof from the weight of the incoming lot. The weight of each failing lot shall be determined by weighing it, or by deriving such weight by applying the original average container weight to the number of containers.</P>

                <P>(5) Any financially interested party may, upon the payment of any fees assessed by the inspection service, obtain an appeal inspection. An appeal inspection shall be applicable only to raisins which have not been removed from their containers, with pallet control cards still affixed, are readily identifiable, and have not been removed from the original inspection point: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That when the condition of a lot of such raisins may have changed subsequent to the original inspection, an additional inspection, rather than an appeal inspection, may be obtained.</P>
                <P>(6) Raisins produced by a handler shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) (3) and (4) of this section upon delivery to an inspection point. Raisins produced by a handler by dehydration within an inspection point shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) (3) and (4) of this section immediately upon completion of said dehydration.</P>
                <P>(7) The inspection certificate for a mixed lot of natural condition raisins (raisins of different varietal types commingled within their containers) shall show the percentage which the raisins of each varietal type is of the total raisins contained in the lot.</P>

                <P>(8) With respect to any lot of natural condition raisins being received and inspected at a handler's inspection point pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the handler shall notify the inspection service if he elects to have the raisins inspected for infestation. If the handler elects not to have the raisins inspected for infestation, he shall: (i) Fumigate promptly all raisins he receives; (ii) notify the inspection service in advance of the time he plans to fumigate such raisins; (iii) permit the inspection service to monitor the fumigation; and (iv) permit the inspection service to make periodic incubation checks of his packed raisins. The inspection service shall certify the raisins received as standard raisins if they meet all other grade and condition standards. If the handler elects to have the raisins inspected for infestation, the inspector shall afford such handler the opportunity to fumigate such raisins during the inspection and certification process. Such raisins shall remain under the supervision of the inspector during the fumigation. The inspection certificate shall not be issued until the fumigation is completed: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the inspection certificate shall be issued, whether or not the fumigation is completed, not later than five business days after the date the inspection and certification process is <PRTPAGE P="595"/>suspended by the inspector to permit fumigation.</P>
                <P>(9) With respect to any lot (as defined in § 989.104(a)(1)) of natural condition raisins being received and inspected at a handler's inspection point pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section and notwithstanding separation of the meeting portion of the original lot from the failing portions thereof for the purposes on § 989.104 and paragraph (a)(4) of this section, any tenderer may, when permitted by the handler and when notified by the inspector of defects during the inspection and certification process, and in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, perform any one or more of the following on an individual box basis: (i) Mix raisins within boxes containing raisins that are wet, or of high moisture content in some areas of the box; (ii) dump raisins from wet boxes into dry boxes; (iii) remove wet raisins; or (iv) remove foreign material such as sandburs, puncture vine seed, Eucalyptus pods or leaves, rocks, and sticks. This authorization to the tenderer shall not extend to raisins in containers larger than sweat boxes; and the number of boxes in the original lot on which the aforesaid actions may be performed during such process shall not exceed ten, or five percent of the total number of containers in the lot, whichever is less. Where the percentage computation results in a fraction of a box and is less than ten boxes, it shall be rounded upward to the next number. The entire lot of raisins shall remain under surveillance of the inspector during such process. The actions of the tenderer shall be done without delay, take place at the unloading dock in the inspection point, or in the immediate area thereof, and be under observation of the inspector.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission of inspection certificates to the Committee.</E> A copy of each inspection certificate which a handler is required to submit to the Committee pursuant to § 989.58(d) shall be submitted not later than Wednesday of the week following the week for which such certificate was issued. This may be accomplished by authorizing the inspection service to submit a copy of each such inspection certificate directly to the Committee. A copy of such authorization shall be furnished to the Committee.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Off-grade raisins</E>—(1) <E T="03">Holding and identification.</E> The inspection certificates covering any lot of off-grade raisins shall state whether or not such off-grade raisins are storable. Any raisins which do not meet the applicable grade and condition standards shall be classified in one of the three categories specified in § 989.58(e)(1) within 5 business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) after inspection or 3 such business days after issuance of the inspection certificate, whichever is later: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That these time limits may be extended by the Committee under such conditions as it may deem necessary in the circumstances. The handler shall report to the Committee the information as required and specified in § 989.173(b)(5). Any such lot of off-grade raisins shall be identified immediately following inspection by fixing to a container on each pallet a prenumbered RAC control card (to be furnished by the Committee), and kept separate and apart from any other raisins in the handler's possession. In the event the handler does not normally use pallets in his operation the RAC control card shall be affixed to one or more of the containers in each lot. The RAC control cards shall remain fixed to the containers until the raisins are (i) disposed of by the handler in eligible non-normal outlets, (ii) returned unstemmed to the tenderer, or (iii) submitted for reconditioning. The cards shall be removed only by an inspector of the inspection service or authorized Committee personnel, except control cards designating lots held only for fumigation may be removed by the handler after the completion of fumigation to the satisfaction of the inspection service. Each lot of off-grade raisins not returned to the tenderer shall be stored by the handler separate and apart by varietal types from all other raisins and by disposition and conditioning categories which preserve the lot identity and, if for reconditioning, the defect identity. Off-grade raisins shall be stored in such a manner as to be accessible to the Committee.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Change in off-grade categories.</E> After raisins have been classified as to the categories in § 989.58(e)(1), any lot <PRTPAGE P="596"/>of natural condition off-grade raisins held by a handler under paragraph (i) or (iii) of § 989.58(e)(1), may be changed to the other category, or to paragraph (ii). Prior to making such change, the handler shall notify the inspection service at least one business day in advance of the time such handler plans to begin such change. Such notification shall be provided verbally or by other means of communication, including e-mail. Any off-grade lot under paragraph (ii) of § 989.58(e)(1) which has not been removed from the handler premises and is identifiable with the original inspection, may be tendered to the handler for the purposes of paragraph (i) or (iii) of § 989.58(e)(1) and, if accepted, the handler shall so report to the Committee. It shall be the responsibility of the handler to establish and maintain the identity of the raisins in the changed categories in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Where the tenderer has a financial interest in the raisins the handler shall, before making any change in category, submit to the Committee evidence of the tenderer's permission to make any such change, except for changes from paragraph (i) or paragraph (iii) to paragraph (ii) of § 989.58(e)(1).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Inter-plant and inter-packer transfer of off-grade raisins.</E> Any packer may, pursuant to § 989.58(e)(2) and under the surveillance of the inspection service, transfer to or from another packer's plant in California, any off-grade raisins for reconditioning. Such transfer may be for the packer's convenience or that of a financially interested person. Where a tenderer or other person has a financial interest in the raisins, the handler shall first obtain the tenderer's or other interested person's written agreement to the transfer. The handler shall notify the inspection service in advance of the time such handler plans to transfer each lot. Such notification shall be provided verbally or by other means of communication, including e-mail. The notification shall be at least 1 business day in advance of the transfer unless a shorter period is acceptable to the inspection service. In the same manner except for the tenderer's or other person's written agreement, any packer may transfer off-grade raisins from one of his plants or inspection points to another of his plants in California. In both cases such raisins may be removed directly to the premises of the receiving packer or another plant of the packer under the surveillance of the inspection service. Upon completion of the transfer all applicable provisions of this part shall apply with respect to such raisins and the packer receiving them.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Reconditioning off-grade raisins—reconditioning requirements.</E> (i) The handler shall notify the inspection service at least one business day in advance of the time such handler plans to begin reconditioning each lot of raisins, unless a shorter period is acceptable to the inspection service. Such notification shall be provided verbally or by other means of communication, including email. Natural condition raisins which have been reconditioned shall continue to be considered natural condition raisins for purposes of reinspection (inspection pursuant to § 989.58(d)) after such reconditioning has been completed, if no water or moisture has been added; otherwise, such raisins shall be considered as packed raisins. The weight of the raisins reconditioned successfully shall be determined by reweighing, except where a lot, before reconditioning, failed due to excess moisture only. The weight of such raisins resulting from reconditioning a lot failing account excess moisture may be determined by deducting 1.2 percent of the weight for each percent of moisture in excess of the allowable tolerance. When necessary due to the presence of sand, as determined by the inspection service, the requirement for deducting sand tare and the manner of its determination, as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall apply in computing the net weight of any such successfully reconditioned natural condition raisins. The weight of the reconditioned raisins acquired as packed raisins shall be adjusted to natural condition weight by the use of factors applicable to the various degrees of processing accomplished. The applicable factor shall be that selected by the inspector of the reconditioned raisins from among factors established by the Committee with the approval of the Secretary.<PRTPAGE P="597"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) In reconditioning off-grade raisins, a handler shall use methods designed to remove the defects whereby the lot fails to qualify as standard raisins. Lots with identical defects may be reconditioned simultaneously (commingled basis) but lots with differing defects shall be reconditioned as separate lots.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">General.</E> Reconditioning of off-grade raisins by a handler shall be done in accordance with such procedure as will enable the inspector to observe the off-grade raisins at any time and to make a proper inspection. A packer may recover raisins from residual raisin material obtained from his reconditioning operations in conformity with the applicable provisions of § 989.159(g)(1).</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Off-grade raisins which are not reconditioned successfully.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, no handler shall return to the tenderer any off-grade raisins received for reconditioning which, after his reconditioning of them is complete, have been stemmed and which then fail to meet the applicable minimum grade standards. Any raisins which fail to meet the applicable minimum grade and condition standards or minimum grade standards after reconditioning and all residual material from reconditioning, held by the handler, shall be identified promptly by affixing to one or more containers in each lot, or to a container in each pallet if pallets are used, a prenumbered RAC control card as prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such failing raisins and residual material which are placed directly into trucks or trailers for immediate disposition need not be identified by affixing thereto a RAC control card. The handler shall hold the failing raisins and the residual material separate and apart from all other raisins. The control cards shall be removed from the containers only by an inspector of the inspection service or authorized Committee personnel. The handler shall physically dispose of the residual material, and any failing raisins which he does not return unstemmed to the tenderer, only in eligible non-normal outlets as provided in § 989.159(g)(2).</P>
                <P>(ii) Any packer may arrange for or permit the tenderer to remove the stemmed raisins (described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section), but not the residual, directly to the premises, within California, of another packer for further reconditioning of the raisins at the latter's premises. Such removal and transfer shall be made under the surveillance of the inspection service. The packer shall notify the inspection service as required in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Such raisins may be received by the other packer without inspection. On and after such receipt of the raisins for further reconditioning, all applicable provisions of this part shall apply with respect to such raisins and the packer so receiving them.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Return of off-grade raisins to tenderer.</E> Any off-grade raisins which are to be returned unstemmed to the tenderer pursuant to § 989.58(e)(1)(ii), shall be physically returned within five business days after the issuance of the inspection certificate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such time limit may be extended by the Committee as it may deem justified by extenuating circumstances. The handler shall file with the Committee a report of the returned raisins as required in § 989.173(b)(4).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Unstemmed and stemmed raisins.</E> For the purpose of determining whether or not off-grade raisins may be returned to the person tendering such raisins, “unstemmed” raisins shall be defined as lots of raisins that contain 150 or more capstems per pound. “Stemmed” raisins means lots of raisins that contain less than 150 capstems per pound.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Reinspection of raisins held more than one hundred and twenty days on memorandum receipt.</E> No handler shall acquire raisins held on memorandum receipt for a period longer than one hundred and twenty (120) days unless such raisins have been reinspected and certified immediately prior to acquisition as meeting the minimum requirements for standard raisins: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Committee at any other time may require such reinspection and certification of raisins held on memorandum receipt as a prerequisite to acquisition if it has reason to believe that the raisins do not then meet such requirements.<PRTPAGE P="598"/>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Identification of inspected raisins.</E> (1) Each handler shall mark each shipping container with legible code or other identification, satisfactory to the Committee and the inspection service which shall indicate with respect to packed raisins, the date that the raisins in such shipping containers were packed, and with respect to shipments of natural condition raisins, the date on which such raisins were inspected.</P>

                <P>(2) Each handler shall furnish promptly to the Committee, through the inspection service, a certified report on a form furnished by the Committee showing the handler's count and weight of the raisins of each pack and varietal type packed each day.<PRTPAGE P="601"/>

                <P>(2) Such inspection of natural condition raisins (which is subject to exceptions and exemptions provided in this part) shall be made of each individual lot and in each case not more than five days before the date of shipment or other final disposition of the lot. The certificate that the raisins meet the applicable minimum grade and condition standards for natural condition raisins, which the handler is required to obtain and submit to the Committee pursuant to § 989.59(d), shall be on Form FV 146 labeled “Certificate of Quality and Condition (Processed Foods).” If shipment involves exportation to a foreign country, the handler shall surrender to the United States Customs Service at the port of exit two copies of such inspection certificate. Such an inspection and certification (on Form FV 146) may, if requested by the handler, be made at the time of his receipt or acquisition of the raisins. In such an event, no additional inspection shall be required if the lot remains intact and identifiable, and shipment or other final disposition takes place within five days after the date of the inspection.</P>
                <P>(3) Such inspection of packed raisins shall be made prior to shipment or other final disposition, and unless made during the final processing or packing operations so as to facilitate proper sampling, the inspector shall perform the inspection on the basis of representative samples drawn from shipping containers of the packed raisins.</P>
                <P>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this part, where there is presented for inspection a lot of packed raisins consisting of raisins of different varietal types or sub-types commingled within their containers, each such type and sub-type shall be inspected separately, except that inspection for moisture shall be performed on the lot as a whole. The inspection certificate shall show the respective percentages which the raisins of the various types and sub-types are of the lot and whether each meets the applicable minimum grade standards. In the event the raisins of any such varietal type or sub-type contained in the lot fail to meet the applicable requirements, other than for moisture, none of the lot shall be certified as meeting minimum grade standards unless it is found to be practicable to separate the raisins into two new lots, one which meets and the other which fails to meet all of the applicable minimum standards, respectively. Any lot of mixed types or sub-types of packed raisins for which minimum grade standards are prescribed for each type or sub-type pursuant to § 989.59 (a) and (b) but which in their commingled form cannot be inspected against the standards for the respective varietal types or sub-types and hence are excluded from the category of “Mixed types” as defined in the then effective United States Standards for Grades of Processed Raisins, or any raisins which as a mixed lot contain moisture in excess of 18 percent, shall not be certified as meeting the minimum grade standard for packed raisins.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of inspection certificates to the Committee.</E> A copy of each inspection certificate which a handler is required to submit to the Committee pursuant to § 989.59(d) shall be submitted not later than Wednesday of the week following the week in which the certificate was issued. This may be accomplished by authorizing the inspection service in writing to submit a copy of each such inspection certificate directly to the Committee. A copy of such authorization shall be furnished to the Committee.</P>

                <P>(2) Has any shipment or portion of a shipment returned to his inspection point or storage premises within the area,shall, before any such shipment or final disposition, or before blending with other raisins, have such raisins inspected for condition and shall furnish promptly to the Committee (which may be through the inspection <PRTPAGE P="602"/>service as provided in § 989.158(b)) a copy of the inspection certificate showing that the raisins meet the respective requirements of this part for shipment, final disposition or blending.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemption of experimental and specialty packs</E>—(1) <E T="03">Shipment under exemption.</E> Upon obtaining approval of the Committee as provided in this paragraph, any handler may ship or dispose of raisins in experimental or specialty packs without regard to one or more of the requirements of the minimum grade standards for packed raisins and inspection and certification requirements, prescribed pursuant to § 989.59. For the purpose of this exemption, experimental and specialty packs means raisins processed using methods, materials, or techniques that are not normally employed in packing raisins.</P>

The provisions of this paragraph (g)(1) are not intended to excuse any failure to comply with all applicable food and sanitary rules and regulations of city, county, state, federal, or other agencies having jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> (i) Except as authorized in this part, no handler shall ship or otherwise dispose of any off-grade raisins, other failing raisins, or raisin residual material.

                <P>(v) The Committee may, for cause, revoke any previously approved application of a handler if the handler, buyer, consignee or user covered by the application has shipped or made disposition inconsistent with any approved application.

              <P>Effective pursuant to § 989.58, raisins meeting the varietal standards hereinafter set forth shall be considered as standard raisins and those failing to meet such standards shall be considered as off-grade raisins. Where the raisins in any lot consist of two or more varietal types commingled within their containers, the lot shall be considered as a mixed lot and as standard raisins if they meet for each defect the most restrictive requirements for the varietal types of raisins comprising the lot. In the event layered Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Cluster Seedless raisins are commingled within their containers with loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or loose Cluster Seedless raisins respectively, the entire lot shall be considered as loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. The raisins shall be considered as standard raisins if the lot as a whole meets the minimum standards for loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That with respect to the requirements peculiar to a varietal type such as possessing characteristic color, flavor, or odor, the raisins shall be considered as meeting such requirements if they have been properly prepared as raisins. In each category, only those raisins which have been properly dried and cured in original natural condition, are free from active infestation, and are in such condition that they are capable of being received, stored, and packed without undue deterioration or spoilage, shall be considered as storable raisins.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Meaning of terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Words used in this subpart in the singular form shall be deemed to impart the plural, and vice versa, as the case may demand. For the purposes of provisions and regulations of this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Acceptable hemp THC level.</E> When a laboratory tests a sample, it must report the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis and the measurement of uncertainty. The acceptable hemp THC level for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of State, Tribal, or USDA hemp plans is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is ±0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for the purpose of plan compliance. This definition of “acceptable hemp THC level” affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. 1639o(1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of “marihuana,” 21 U.S.C. 802(16), in the CSA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Nominees.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For the purpose of obtaining nominations for producer members to represent independent producers, the Committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, divide the area into districts giving, insofar as practicable, equal representation to numbers of independent producers and production of prune tonnage by such producers. The number of districts shall be equal to the number of such producer members or seven, whichever is the lesser. Candidates for nomination by independent producers from the various districts shall be obtained at meetings convened by the committee. Following such meetings, the committee shall prepare a separate ballot for each of the districts, or a joint ballot for two or more districts, containing (1) the names of the candidates for each district involved and (2) provision for write-in candidates. The ballot shall be mailed to each independent producer of record in each district. The voting procedure (including the casting of the ballot by mail addressed to the committee), and tabulation of votes shall be in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary. Each voter shall be entitled to cast only one vote for a member nominee and only one vote for an alternate member nominee in a district in which he is a producer, and no voter shall vote for candidates in more than one district. In case he is a producer in more than one district, he shall elect in which of such districts he will vote and notify the committee as to his choice. Whenever the number of producer members to represent independent producers during the ensuing term of office is to exceed seven, one nominee shall be nominated by independent producers in each of the seven districts and an additional nominee for each member in excess of the seven members shall be nominated, without reference to districts, by such seven nominees. The committee shall recommend the establishment of districts, or any changes therein, to the Secretary prior to January 31 of each year in which nominations are made.</P>

                <P>(b) Before April 16 of each even-numbered year nominations of producer members to represent cooperative producers and handler members to represent cooperative handlers shall be submitted to the Secretary by cooperative marketing associations engaged in <PRTPAGE P="638"/>the handling of prunes. The number of cooperative producer members and handler members to be nominated by each cooperative marketing association shall bear, as near as practicable, the same percentage as each cooperative marketing association's tonnage of prunes handled as first handler thereof is to the total tonnage handled by all cooperative marketing associations during the preceding crop year.</P>
                <P>(c) In any year in which nominations are made following a crop year during which the tonnage of prunes handled by independent handlers as first handlers exceeded the tonnage of prunes handled by cooperative handlers as first handlers, nominees for member positions to represent independent handlers shall be nominated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Each of the two independent handlers who handled during such preceding crop year, the two largest percentages of the prune tonnage handled by all independent handlers shall nominate from their respective organizations, one nominee for a handler member and one for an alternate member;</P>
                <P>(2) Three independent handlers who handled during such preceding crop year the next three largest percentages of the prune tonnage handled by all independent handlers shall nominate from among their organizations, one nominee for a handler member and one for an alternate member;</P>
                <P>(3) All other independent handlers who handled the remaining percentage of such prune tonnage shall nominate from their organizations, one nominee for a handler member and one for an alternate member.</P>
                <FP>In any year in which nominations are made following a crop year during which the tonnage of prunes handled by cooperative handlers as first handlers exceeded the tonnage of prunes handled by independent handlers as first handlers, nominees for two member and alternate positions to represent the independent handlers referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be nominated in accordance with said paragraph (c)(1), and one nominee for the member and one for the alternate position to represent all other independent handlers shall be nominated by the handlers referred to in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section and the votes of such handlers shall be weighted by the tonnage of prunes handled during the preceding crop year by the respective handlers.</FP>
                <P>(d) The committee shall establish with the approval of the Secretary, the procedures by which such nominations, other than by cooperative marketing associations engaged in the handling of prunes, shall be obtained and shall submit such nominations to the Secretary before April 16 of the year in which nominations are made. In the event the committee determines that any nominating procedure specified in this section does not result in equitable representation, it may establish, with the prior approval of the Secretary, such modifications as will tend to assure such representation.</P>
                <P>(e) The producer and handler members of the Committee selected for a new term of office shall nominate a public member and alternate member at the first meeting following their selection.</P>

Any “high moisture content prunes,” as described in the exception in § 993.5(b), in the possession of a handler, shall be held separate and apart from any prunes held by him. If such “high moisture content prunes” are dried or dehydrated to a point where they are capable of being stored, without material deterioration or spoilage, unrefrigerated or not otherwise artificially preserved, they shall be deemed, at that time, to have been received by such handler as prunes, and shall be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary, on the basis of a recommendation of the committee or other information, may establish size regulations or more restrictive grade regulations with resepct to prunes that may be received by a handler from producers and dehydrators whenever he finds that such action would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act.</P>

                <P>(c) In no crop year shall a handler receive from producers or dehydrators prunes, other than as undersized prunes, which pass freely through a round opening with a diameter as follows: For French prunes 23/32 of an inch, and for non-French prunes 28/32 of an inch: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Secretary upon a recommendation of the Committee, may establish larger openings whenever it is determined that supply conditions for a crop year warrant such <PRTPAGE P="642"/>regulation.

                <P>(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, no handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of prunes which fail to meet the applicable minimum standards set forth in § 993.97 (Exhibit A), or as such standards may be modified, for standard prunes or standard processed prunes.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary, on the basis of a recommendation of the committee or other information, may establish size regulations, pack specifications, or more restrictive grade regulations with respect to prunes that may be shipped or otherwise disposed of by a handler if such action would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. If a more restrictive grade regulation is established in connection with § 993.97 (Exhibit A) it shall insofar as practicable apply comparably to both natural condition prunes and processed prunes. When pack specifications are in effect, no handler shall ship prunes in consumer packages, unless such prunes are identified by an appropriate label, seal, stamp, or tag affixed to such container by the handler showing the size of prunes in the lot from which the container was packed. In order to effectuate such orderly marketing of prunes as will be in the public interest, whether prices are above or below parity, no handler shall use descriptive terms in a manner inconsistent with that set forth in this subpart or in any pack specifications or other regulation issued by the Secretary pursuant to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) Non-French prunes: No handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of standard prunes or standard processed prunes of the non-French varieties or any lot which includes non-French prunes in excess of a tolerance to be prescribed by the Secretary on recommendation of the Committee, unless the average count of such non-French prunes contained in any such lot is 40 or less per pound. However, under safeguards to be established by the Committee, any lot containing non-French prunes with an average size count of more than 40 prunes per pound may be shipped to or disposed of in prune product outlets in which they lose their form and character as prunes by conversion prior to consumption. A tolerance as to the permitted deviation of sizes about the average count shall be prescribed by the Secretary, upon recommendation of the Committee.</P>
                <P>(d) French prunes: No handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of French prunes for human consumption as prunes, or any lot of mixed dried fruit containing French prunes for human consumption as mixed dried fruit, unless the average count of French prunes contained in any such lot is 100 or less per pound. However, under safeguards to be established by the Committee, any lot containing French prunes with an average size count of more than 100 prunes per pound may be shipped to or disposed of in prune product outlets in which they lose their form and character as prunes by conversion prior to consumption. In determining whether any such lot conforms to this minimum size requirement, the following tolerance shall apply: In a sample of 100 ounces, the count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes shall not vary from the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 45 points. The Secretary may, upon the basis of the recommendation and information submitted by the Committee and other available information, modify this tolerance for uniformity of size.</P>

                <P>(e) No handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of substandard prunes except for use as prune products in which the prunes lose their form and character as prunes by conversion prior to consumption, or for use in non-human consumption outlets: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any such prunes which are shipped or otherwise disposed of for human consumption shall meet the minimum standards prescribed in II C (1), (2), and (3) of § 993.97 or as such standards as may pursuant <PRTPAGE P="643"/>to § 993.52 be modified. The committee shall issue any such rules and regulations as may be necessary to insure such uses.</P>
                <P>(f) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in this section, any handler may transfer prunes from one plant owned by him to another plant owned by him within the area without having an inspection made as provided for in § 993.51. Any handler may ship prunes from his plant to another handler's plant within the area without having an inspection made as provided for in § 993.51, but a report of such inter-handler transfer shall be made promptly by the transferring handler to the committee. The receiving handler shall, before shipping or otherwise making final disposition of such prunes, comply with the requirements of this section and of § 993.51.</P>
                <P>(g) No handler shall ship or otherwise dispose of, for human consumption, the quantity of prunes determined by the inspection service pursuant to § 993.49(c) to be undersized prunes. However, such handler may, at the direction and under the supervision of the Committee, dispose of such quantity of prunes in nonhuman consumption outlets. Prunes so disposed of shall be of the same variety as, and reasonably comparable in size, to such undersized prunes. The handler shall cause the inspection service to make a determination whether the prunes disposed of by the handler in nonhuman consumption outlets meet such requirements. In making the determination with respect to comparability in size, the inspection service shall apply a tolerance permitting a deviation from the size of the applicable opening established pursuant to § 993.49(c). Any such tolerance, together with any rules and regulations to insure proper disposition of the prunes and that such prunes are reasonably comparable to the undersized prunes so received, shall be established by the Committee with the approval of the Secretary. The quantity of prunes determined pursuant to § 993.49(c) shall not be deemed to be within the handler's quota for salable prunes fixed by the Secretary within the meaning of section 8a(5) of the Act.</P>

Purchases shall be made from prunes with respect to which the reserve obligation has been met, and shall be of grades, varieties, or sizes and in such containers as the committee specifies in consideration of available reserve prune outlets. Purchases shall be at prices determined to be appropriate by the committee and if more prunes are offered than required by the committee, it shall make the purchases from various handlers as nearly as practicable in proportion to the quantity of their respective offerings at the same price.

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Diversion certificates.</E> After diversion operations are authorized, and subject to the applicable rules and procedures, any producer may divert prune plums of his own production for eligible purposes and receive from the committee a diversion certificate therefor: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That diversion certificates for prune plums diverted by producer members of a cooperative marketing association shall be issued by the committee to the association if it so requests.

Such eligible diversions may include: (1) Disposal of prune plums for nonhuman use; (2) leaving prune plums unharvested; and (3) such other methods of diversion as may be authorized. No diversion certificate shall be issued by the committee for prune plums which would not, under normal producer practices, be dried and delivered to a handler.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods of disposition.</E> The committee may, for any of the purposes of § 993.65(a), offer to sell and sell reserve prunes to handlers for disposition or sale by them in specified outlets. Sale of reserve prunes by the committee to any handler for resale in such outlets or for resale to other persons for sale in such outlets shall be governed by the provisions of a sales agreement, executed by the handler with the committee. The committee may refuse to sell reserve prunes to any handler if the handler violates the terms and conditions of the agreement or other provisions of this part. The committee may sell reserve prunes into any outlet in which direct selling is determined to be more appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Offers to sell reserve prunes.</E> No offer to sell reserve prunes either to handlers or to other persons shall be made by the committee until 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) have elapsed from the time it files with the Secretary complete information as to the terms and conditions of the proposed offer including <PRTPAGE P="647"/>the basis for determining the handlers' shares: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That at any time prior to the expiration of the 5-day period the offer may be made upon the committee receiving from the Secretary notice that he does not disapprove it.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer of shares.</E> No handler may transfer a reserve obligation. However, any handler who is authorized by the committee to dispose of reserve prunes may arrange with another handler to dispose of his share of reserve prunes through such other handler. In that event, credit for the reserve disposition shall go to the handler whose reserve prunes are used.</P>

Net proceeds from the disposition of reserve prunes shall be distributed by the committee either directly, or through handlers as agents of the committee, under safeguards to be established by the committee, to persons in proportion to their contributions thereto, or to their successors in interest, with appropriate grade and size differentials as established by the committee. Progress payments may be made by the committee as sufficient funds accumulate. Distribution of the proceeds in connection with the reserve prunes contributed by a cooperative marketing association shall be made to such association, if it so requests.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Receiving stations</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Prunes shall be received by a handler at any receiving station so designated by the Committee. <E T="03">Receiving station</E> shall mean any plant of a handler or a dehydrator's premises; this term shall also mean any other place where prunes are normally and usually received by a handler in any considerable volume as ranch deliveries, and at which there are adequate facilities to enable the inspection service to determine whether the prunes meet the applicable grade, size, and condition requirements.<PRTPAGE P="654"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Receiving at dehydrator.</E> Any handler may arrange with the committee and the inspection service for the incoming inspection and certification to be based on samples of prunes drawn as prune plums and dehydrated in the same manner as the prunes to which they are referable. Where such arrangement is acceptable to the Committee as permitting the inspection and certification of the prunes to be comparable to an inspection and certification when based on samples drawn as prunes, such certification shall be acceptable for the purposes of this section if the inspector further certifies that the dehydration process of the prunes being certified resulted in prunes eligible to be received under the terms and conditions of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection stations.</E> Prunes shall be inspected only at inspection stations established by the inspection service with the concurrence of the Committee. <E T="03">Inspection station</E> shall mean a centralized station and any receiving station other than a handler's plant or a dehydrator's premises.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Incoming inspection</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Upon any producer or dehydrator delivering prunes to a handler, the handler shall issue to the inspection service an identification tag showing the name and address of such producer or dehydrator, the date of delivery, the county of production, the number and type of containers, the approximate net weight of the prunes, the place where the prunes are to be inspected, and any other information necessary to identify such prunes to the satisfaction of the inspector and the Committee. For each such delivery, the handler shall issue to the producer or dehydrator a door receipt or weight certificate showing the name and address of the producer or dehydrator, the weight of the delivery, and any other information necessary to identify the delivery. Such information shall be available to the inspector and the Committee. Each lot shall be sampled separately and as soon as practicable following delivery. The handler shall supply any necessary information together with any assistance needed by the inspector in drawing samples including the dumping of containers.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Following inspection of a lot not returned to the producer or dehydrator, the handler shall require the inspection service to issue, in quintuplicate, a certificate containing at least the following information: (i) The place where samples were drawn and the date and place of inspection; (ii) the name and address of the producer or dehydrator, the handler, and the inspection service; (iii) the variety of the prunes, the county in which such prunes were produced, the number and type of the containers thereof, the net weight of the prunes as shown on the applicable door receipt or weight certificate, together with the number of such receipt or certificate, and the contract or account number under which the prunes were delivered; (iv) whenever applicable, the percentage by weight of undersized prunes in the lot; (v) with respect to the balance of the lot, the inspector's computation of the percentage, by screen size of prunes and in the aggregate, of each group or combination of groups of defects for which a maximum tolerance is in effect; (vi) whether the prunes in the lot, exclusive of any undersigned prunes, are standard or substandard; (vii) the inspector's computation of the percentage of weight of each screen size and in the aggregate, of offgrade prunes (those defective pursuant to § 993.97) necessary to be removed therefrom in order for the remainder in each screen size and in the aggregate to be standard prunes, and (viii) the average size count of prunes of each screen size and of the aggregate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That whenever an undersized prune regulation is in effect for the crop year, the average size count shall be of all prunes except undersized prunes in the lot, by screen size and in the aggregate. The handlers shall require the inspection service to furnish promptly the producer or dehydrator with one copy of the certificate and the handler with two copies.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Conditional provisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Wet or slack-dry prunes.</E> Any prunes delivered to a handler by a producer or dehydrator which an inspector determines have not been properly dried and cured in original natural condition, or which show evidence of the addition thereto of water, may be held by the handler <PRTPAGE P="655"/>for the account of the producer or dehydrator for conditioning by further drying or dehydration: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such prunes shall be identified and kept separate and apart from any other prunes in the handler's possession until resubmitted for inspection and certificated as properly dried and cured, or returned to the producer or dehydrator. The certificate shall show, in addition to other inspection requirements, that the conditioning was performed and indicate the net weight after conditioning.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Prunes with active insect infestation.</E> Any prunes delivered to a handler which an inspector determines are not free from active insect infestation, may be returned to the producer or dehydrator or may be held by the handler for the account of the producer or dehydrator for conditioning by fumigation: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such prunes shall be identified and kept separate and apart from any other prunes in the handler's possession until resubmitted for inspection and certificated to show, in addition to other inspection requirements, performance of fumigation and freedom from active infestation.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">High moisture content prunes.</E> The delivery of any high moisture content prunes to a handler by a producer or dehydrator shall be reported promptly by the handler to the inspection service. The inspection service shall be requested to submit a report to the committee of each such delivery which shall contain the following information: (i) The date and place of the delivery; (ii) the name and address of the producer or dehydrator, the handler, and the inspection service; and (iii) the variety of the high moisture content prunes, the county in which they were produced, and their net weight as shown on the door receipt or weight certificate, together with the number of such receipt or certificate. Any handler who, subsequent to delivery to him of high moisture content prunes, elects to dry or dehydrate them or any portion thereof to a point where they are capable of being received by such handler shall, prior to proceeding with such drying or dehydration, notify an inspector of the inspection service of his election, and the same procedure shall apply as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. For each day on which a handler processes and packages high moisture content prunes, he shall furnish promptly to the inspector a signed statement and one copy showing the handler's name and address and the net weight of the total tonnage of high moisture content prunes processed and packaged by him on that day. The handler shall furnish promptly to the inspector two copies of the shipping or disposition order or other documents which shall show the date of each shipment or disposition, the applicable reference number thereof, and an adequate description of the shipment or disposition. One copy of each document so furnished shall be required to be forwarded to the committee. Upon request of the committee a handler shall, within ten days thereafter, file with the committee a signed report on Form PMC 3.1 “Report of High Moisture Content Prunes” which shall contain the following information: (i) The date and the name and address of the handler; (ii) the total tonnage of high moisture content prunes delivered to the handler during the crop year to the date of the report; (iii) the total tonnage of high moisture content prunes shipped or otherwise disposed of by the handler during such period; (iv) the total tonnage of high moisture content prunes delivered to the handler during such period which were dried or dehydrated and received as prunes by the handler; and (v) the total tonnage of high moisture content prunes in the handler's possession on the date of the report.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Return of prunes to producers and dehydrators.</E> Any lot of prunes delivered to a handler by a producer or dehydrator may be returned to the producer or dehydrator prior to an inspection thereof. Any lot of prunes so delivered whose identity has been maintained may be so returned following an inspection thereof, except prunes which have been size graded or sorted by the handler, resulting in a segregation of defects. Prunes which have been sorted for the producer or dehydrator, the identity of which have been maintained to the satisfaction of the inspector and the Committee, may be resubmitted for inspection in not more than three <PRTPAGE P="656"/>new lots, equal in weight to the original lot, and the applicable inspections shall supersede the original inspection.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Disposition of prunes by handlers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Inspection stations.</E> An inspection station shall be any plant of a handler, and any other place where he handles prunes.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Outgoing inspection.</E> Except as otherwise specifically provided, no handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of natural condition prunes or of processed prunes unless he has, prior to such shipment or final disposition, had them inspected and obtained a certificate showing that such prunes meet the effective minimum standards. Such inspection shall be made during that portion of the final preparation of the prunes for shipment or other final disposition as will permit proper sampling, whether in-line or floor inspection, and no handler shall perform such final preparation unless an inspector is present. The handler shall furnish promptly to the inspector a copy of the shipping or disposition order or other documents, which shall show the date of each shipment or disposition, the applicable reference number thereof, and an adequate description of the shipment or disposition. For the prunes inspected each day which meet the applicable minimum grade and size requirements for standard prunes, or standard processed prunes, the handler shall cause the inspector to issue in triplicate a signed certificate containing the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) The date and place of inspection;</P>
                <P>(2) The name and address of the handler and of the inspection service;</P>
                <P>(3) The number and size of packages or the net weight of prunes;</P>
                <P>(4) The number of the worksheet or worksheets on which the inspector's computations and results of tests are recorded; and</P>
                <P>(5) A statement that the prunes meet the effective minimum standards for standard prunes, or standard processed prunes, as the case may be.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Interhandler transfers.</E> With the exception of those prunes held by a handler pending their disposition pursuant to § 993.49(c) and those prunes held by him for the account of the Committee pursuant to § 993.57, a handler may transfer prunes to another handler within the area. Any such interhandler transfer may be without the transferring handler having an inspection made as provided for in § 993.51: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That before each such transfer the transferring handler shall: (1) Give written notice of the transfer to the inspection service including the proposed date of the transfer, the names of the handlers and, by plant designation, the present location and the destination of the prunes, the number of containers, variety, size designation, and total net weight of the prunes, and the manifest or billing number; and (2) receive from the inspection service a DFA Form P-5 “Shipping Inspection Report and Certificate” marked “Interhandler Transfer Report” on which the inspection service recorded the information furnished by the transferring handler. The transferring handler shall sign the “Interhandler Transfer Report” including all copies thereof that were received from the inspection service, and forward the signed original and one copy to the receiving handler at the time of the interhandler transfer. Upon receipt of the transferred prunes, the receiving handler shall enter on both the original and the copy the date he received the prunes, sign the original, and immediately forward it to the inspection service. The transferring handler shall cause the inspection service to promptly report the transfer to the Committee. As provided in § 993.50(f), the receiving handler shall, before shipping or otherwise making final disposition of such prunes, comply with the requirements of §§ 993.50 and 993.51.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Tolerances for non-French prunes.</E> Any lot of standard prunes or standard processed prunes containing more than 2 percent by weight of non-French prunes shall be disposed of only in prune product outlets as prescribed in § 993.50(c) unless the non-French prunes <PRTPAGE P="657"/>therein have an average count of 40 or less per pound and unless in a 100-ounce sample of the lot, the count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes in the sample does not vary from the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes in the sample by more than 35 points. A lot shall be deemed to exceed the 2 percent tolerance for non-French prunes whenever an inspection shows such prunes exceed 2 percent in any four consecutive sampling units of two tons or less or, if less than four such units are sampled, in such lesser number of units.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Prunes which fail to meet minimum standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Committee's approval of disposition</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Those defective prunes accumulated by a handler by removing them from standard or substandard prunes, and those prunes received or held by a handler which fail to meet the applicable minimum standards and are held for disposition without removal of defective prunes in excess of maximum tolerances, may only be used, if within the tolerances prescribed in § 993.97 II. C. (1), (2), and (3), for prune products, or if any such tolerances are exceeded and any live infestation corrected by fumigation, for non-human consumption or be destroyed. In order to insure that all such prunes are shipped or otherwise disposed of in accordance with § 993.50(e), no handler shall during any crop year ship or otherwise make final disposition of any such prunes, other than prune waste subject to daily non-human disposition for sanitation purposes, unless prior thereto he had obtained during that crop year (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section) the Committee's approval of his application to do so.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Application for approval.</E> The handler's application to ship or otherwise make final disposition of any such prunes shall be submitted on Form PMC 2.2 “Application for Permission to Dispose of Substandard Prunes”. If the prunes are for shipment, the application shall set forth: (<E T="03">a</E>) The name and address of the handler's vendee and the name and address of the consignee whether the same as or different from the vendee; (<E T="03">b</E>) the particular use to be made of the prunes; (<E T="03">c</E>) if such use is to be by a person other than the handler's vendee or the consignee, the name and address of such user; and (<E T="03">d</E>) the crop year or the period within, or the portion of, the crop year during which shipments are to be made. When the use or the name and address of the consignee or user are not known by the handler, the handler shall arrange for the submission of such information to the Committee. If use is to be by the handler, the application shall so indicate and shall set forth all applicable information. Each application for shipment shall be limited to the handler's vendee and the consignee if different from the vendee, and to a specific user and use, and may be open as to quantity: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, when the use or name and address of the user are not known by the handler, the application shall include the quantity of prunes to be shipped and be limited to that quantity. Each application for final disposition for a particular use by the handler shall be limited to such handler and use.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Approval of applications.</E> The Committee's approval of a handler's application shall be transmitted to the handler on Form PMC 2.3 “Permission to Dispose of Substandard Prunes”. In approving an application, the Committee shall specify the crop year, or the period within or the portion of the crop year, for which the approval is granted: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, the Committee may approve in July any such application that is submitted during that month by the handler for shipment or other final disposition of the prunes covered thereby in the succeeding crop year. When the use or the name and address of the user or consignee are not known to the handler, the Committee shall not approve the application until it has been informed as to such use and user and consignee of the prunes.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Disapproval of applications; or revocation of approved applications.</E> In acting on an application, the Committee may disapprove the application when: (<E T="03">a</E>) The application does not conform with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; (<E T="03">b</E>) the Committee has cause to believe that the prunes covered by the application will not be shipped or disposed of in accordance with the application; or (<E T="03">c</E>) the <PRTPAGE P="658"/>handler, or any of the parties involved in the proposed shipment or disposition, had shipped or made other disposition of prunes covered by a previously approved application inconsistent with that application. The Committee may for cause revoke a handler's previously approved application if he ships or makes other disposition inconsistent with such application. Whenever a user uses prunes inconsistent with an approved application, the Committee may for cause revoke such application, and such other approved applications applicable to such user as the Committee deems necessary to assure that the prunes covered by such applications will not be used in a manner inconsistent with those applications or the order. The Committee shall notify the handler in writing of each disapproval and each revocation.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Evidence of non-human disposition.</E> Whenever defective or substandard prunes or prune waste are shipped to or otherwise disposed of in non-human consumption outlets, or destroyed, the handler shall furnish the Committee with a copy of the shipping document or other documentary evidence of the disposition as may be satisfactory to the Committee and at such times as the Committee may direct.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Books and records.</E> Each handler who ships or otherwise disposes of defective or substandard prunes or prune waste shall make available for examination by the Committee, at his business office at any reasonable time during business hours, copies of all applicable purchase orders, sales contracts, or disposition documents, together with any further information which the Committee may deem necessary or desirable to enable it to determine whether such prunes or prune waste have been or will likely be utilized as authorized.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Out of the area shipments.</E> Whenever substandard prunes for human consumption are packed in closed containers, and if for shipment outside the area they shall be so packed, each such container shall be clearly marked “For Manufacturing Purposes Only”. Whenever substandard prunes restricted to non-human usage are shipped in closed containers, each such container shall be clearly marked “For Non-Human Usage”. In each instance, the letters shall be of reasonable prominence and in a conspicuous place on the container.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspection of substandard prunes.</E> Each handler shall cause substandard prunes, for use in prune products, to be inspected (prior to disposition or shipment by a handler) by an inspector, and that such inspector issue, in triplicate, a signed clearance certificate (for the preparation of which the handler shall make available to the inspector the necessary data) containing the following information:</P>
                <P>(i) The date and place of inspection and clearance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The name and address of the inspection service and of the handler;</P>
                <P>(iii) The number and kind of packages, the net weight, and the adequacy of the marking;</P>
                <P>(iv) The lot number or shipping or disposition order number;</P>
                <P>(v) The committee's approval number;</P>
                <P>(vi) The destination; and</P>
                <P>(vii) The actual percentage of off-grade prunes of each group, or combination of groups, of defects in excess of the then current tolerances for standard prunes or standard processed prunes.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Pitted prunes</E>—(1) <E T="03">For human consumption as such.</E> (i) No handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of pitted prunes for human consumption as pitted prunes unless the lot, before pitting, met (A) the applicable minimum standard set forth in § 993.97 (Exhibit A), or as such standards may be modified, for standard prunes or standard processed prunes, and (B) the requirements specified in § 993.50 (c) and (d).</P>

                <P>(ii) No handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of pitted prunes for human consumption as pitted prunes unless these prunes do not exceed an average of 0.5 percent by count of prunes with whole pits and/or pit fragments 2 mm or longer; and four of ten subsamples examined have no more than 0.5 percent by count of prunes with whole pits and/or pit fragments 2 mm or longer. For the purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(ii), pitted prunes means prunes with the <PRTPAGE P="659"/>pit removed that are characterized by a uniform depression and minimal skin break where the pit has been removed.</P>
                <P>(iii) No handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of macerated prunes for human consumption as pitted prunes unless these prunes do not exceed an average of 2 percent by count of prunes with whole pits and/or pit fragments 2 mm or longer; and four of ten subsamples examined have no more than 2 percent by count with whole pits and/or pit fragments 2 mm or longer. For the purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(iii), macerated prunes means prunes with the pit removed that are characterized by a flattened appearance with slightly more skin breaks where the pit has been removed than with pitted prunes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">For use in prune products.</E> Any lot of substandard prunes, whether natural condition or processed, if within the applicable tolerances prescribed in § 993.97 II C (1), (2), and (3), may be pitted and shipped or disposed of for use and used in prune products for human consumption: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That prior to shipment or other final disposition by handler, such prunes have lost their form and character as prunes to the satisfaction of the inspector and the committee. An inspection certificate on such lot shall not be issued until the inspector has determined that the prunes therein have lost their form and character as prunes. Disposition of pitted prunes by handlers for use in prune products shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Disposition of undersized prunes</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application for and approval of disposition.</E> Undersized prunes accumulated by a handler pursuant to section 993.49(c) shall be disposed of in non-human consumption outlets during the crop year in which the prunes establishing such obligations were received from producers or dehydrators, or such later date that a handler may request in a notice, filed with the Committee at least 30 days prior to July 31 of the year of accumulation: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, such handler has made a bona fide effort to dispose of its undersized prunes as demonstrated by the shipment of at least 65 percent of its undersized obligation by May 31; such handler has a sufficient quantity of undersized prunes held in storage to meet its remaining obligation; and the extension of time requested is not later than 60 days beyond the end of the crop year. Prior to making any such disposition, the handler shall obtain the Committee's approval of his application to do so. The handler's application to ship or otherwise make final disposition of any such undersized prunes shall be submitted on Form PMC 2.21 “Application for Permission to Dispose of Undersized Prunes” which shall set forth: (i) The name and address of the handler's vendee and the name and address of the consignee whether the same as or different from the vendee; (ii) the particular use to be made of the prunes; (iii) if such use is to be by a person other than the handler's vendee or the consignee, the name and address of such user; and (iv) the crop year or the period within, or portion of, the crop year during which shipment or other disposition is to be made. When the use or the name and address of the consignee or user are not known by the handler, the handler shall arrange for the submission of such information to the Committee. If use is to be by the handler, the application shall so indicate and shall set forth all applicable information. Each application for shipment shall be limited to the handler's vendee and the consignee, if different from the vendee, and to a specific user and use. Each application for final disposition for a particular use by the handler shall be limited to such handler and use. The Committee's approval of a handler's application shall be transmitted to the handler on Form PMC 2.31 “Permission to Dispose of Undersized Prunes.” In approving an application, the Committee shall specify the crop year or the period within, or the portion of, the crop year for which the approval is granted. When the use or name and address of the user or consignee are not known to the handler, the Committee shall not approve the application until it has been informed as to such use and user and consignee of the prunes. The requirements of § 993.150(e)(1)(iv) (except item (<E T="03">a</E>) thereof), (v), and (vi) with regard to disapproval of applications or revocation of approved applications, evidence of <PRTPAGE P="660"/>nonhuman disposition, and the maintenance of books and records, applicable to prunes which fail to meet minimum standards, shall also apply to undersized prunes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Documentation of disposition of undersized prunes</E>—(i) <E T="03">Documentation of shipment or other disposition.</E> For each quantity of undersized prunes so shipped or otherwise disposed of, the handler shall promptly forward to the Committee one copy of the applicable bill of lading, truck receipt, or related documentation of disposition which shall show: (<E T="03">a</E>) The name of the consignee; (<E T="03">b</E>) the destination by name and address of the person designated to receive the prunes; (<E T="03">c</E>) the date of shipment or other disposition; (<E T="03">d</E>) the net weight of the prunes; and (<E T="03">e</E>) identification of the prunes as undersized prunes.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Tolerances permitting a deviation in prune sizes from applicable undersized openings</E>—(i) <E T="03">Undersized French prunes.</E> Whenever an undersized regulation specifies an opening for French prunes, any quantity of any size of French prunes disposed of by a handler in compliance with § 993.50(g) shall satisfy a handler's undersized disposition.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Sales and deliveries.</E> Committee sales and deliveries of reserve prunes from the holdings of any handler shall not exceed the quantity of reserve prunes required to be held by him. The reserve prune holding requirement of the handler shall be reduced by the tonnage so sold or delivered.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Assistance to handlers.</E> As assistance to handlers, the committee shall furnish each handler a monthly tabulation, beginning as soon as possible after the start of the crop year, showing his reserve obligation and holding requirement based on records on file with the committee.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to hold and deliver reserve prunes in accordance with reserve obligation.</E> In the event a handler fails to hold for the committee and deliver his total reserve prune obligation in any category and is unable to rectify such a deficiency with salable prunes, he shall compensate the committee in an amount computed by multiplying the pounds of natural condition prunes so deficient by the applicable values established by the committee: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the remedies prescribed herein shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any of the remedies or penalties prescribed in the act with respect to noncompliance. The determination of any such deficiency shall include application of any tolerance allowance for shrinkage in weight, increase in the number of prunes per pound, and normal and natural deterioration and spoilage which may then be in effect.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Excess delivery of prunes to the committee.</E> In the event a handler delivers to the committee as reserve prunes a quantity of prunes in excess of his holding requirement for reserve prunes, the committee shall make such practical adjustments as are consistent with this part and this may include <PRTPAGE P="661"/>compensating the handler for such excess (nonreserve prunes) by paying to him the proceeds received by the committee for such excess.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Holding reserve prunes on other than a handler's premises.</E> No handler shall hold reserve prunes on the premises of another handler, or in approved commercial storage other than on his own premises, unless prior thereto he notifies the committee in a certified report on Form PMC 5.1 “Notice of Proposed Intent to Store Reserve Prunes” which shall contain at least the following information: (1) The date and the name and address of the handler; (2) the name and address of the person on whose premises the reserve prunes will be stored for the handler; (3) the approximate quantity to be so stored and the exact location and description of the storage facilities; and (4) the proposed date that such storage will begin. The report shall be accompanied by a signed statement by the persons on whose premises the reserve prunes are to be stored agreeing to hold such prunes under conditions of proper storage and further agreeing to permit access to such premises by the committee at any time during business hours for the purpose of examining or taking delivery of such prunes in accordance with the provisions of this part. No handler shall be permitted to hold reserve prunes on any premises outside the area.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Exchange of salable prunes for reserve prunes.</E> No handler shall exchange salable prunes for reserve prunes unless he has entered into a sales agreement authorized pursuant to § 993.65(b) whereby the value of any such exchange, and payment therefor to the committee, shall be determined.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Delivery by nonsignatory handlers.</E> Any handler not signing the sales agreement authorized pursuant to § 993.65(b), shall deliver to the Committee, upon demand, the total weight of his reserve obligation by such variety, grade, and size categories, and at the count per pound for each size category as is required by the reserve control regulation of the applicable crop year. Such deliveries of prunes may be either graded prunes or any lot of ungraded prunes, or portion thereof, identifiable to the satisfaction of the committee as being in the same form as when received: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the percent of standard prunes in each lot shall be taken into account but with respect to any lot of graded prunes, no credit shall be given to the standard obligation of the handler if in a sample of 100 ounces, the count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes exceeds the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 45 prunes per pound.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment for crop year of acquisition.</E> Each handler shall, with respect to reserve prunes held by the handler for the account of the Committee pursuant to § 993.59, be paid at a rate computed by the Committee (natural condition rate) for necessary services rendered by the handler in connection with such prunes so held during all or <PRTPAGE P="662"/>any part of the crop year in which the prunes were physically received from producers or dehydrators. Each handler holding reserve prunes shall perform such services to assure that the prunes are maintained in good condition. No payment will be made for prunes released by handler acceptance of diversion certificates if the handler has not stored the released prunes. The rate of payment shall be established by the Committee and must be approved by the Secretary. Following such approval, it shall be publicized as required in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) On or before July 20 of each crop year when the Committee recommends a reserve pool (except the Committee may extend this date by not more than ten business days if warranted by a late crop), the Committee shall hold a meeting to review the costs for necessary services rendered by handlers in connection with reserve prunes.</P>
                <P>(2) Such amount shall, together with the additional payments, as provided in this section, be in full payment for the costs incurred in connection with but not be limited to the following services: Inspection, receiving, storing, grading, fumigation, and handling. The costs include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Acquisition costs, which include those for salaries, commission, or brokerage fees, transportation and handling between plants and receiving stations, inspection, and other costs, including container expenses, incidental to acquisition or storage;</P>
                <P>(ii) Direct labor costs, which include those for weighing, receiving and stacking, grading, preliminary sorting and storing (including that performed by the handler at the receiving station), and loading for shipment or other delivery to the Committee or its designee;</P>
                <P>(iii) Plant overhead costs, which include those for supervision, indirect labor, fuel, power and water, taxes and insurance on facilities, depreciation and rent, repairs and maintenance (clean-up, etc.), factory supplies and expense, and employee benefits (payroll taxes, compensation insurance, health insurance, pension plan contributions, vacation pay, holiday and other paid days off, and other such costs).</P>
                <P>(3) The Committee shall survey all handlers to obtain their costs for services performed with respect to reserve tonnage prunes. The Committee will compute the average industry cost for holding reserve pool prunes by adding each handlers' cost data, and dividing the composite figure by the number of handlers participating in the survey. In the event that any handler's cost data is too low or too high, the Committee may choose to exclude the high and low data in computing an industry average. The industry average costs may be rounded to the nearest $0.25. The industry average costs computed by the Committee shall be publicized by the Committee pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reimbursement for required insurance costs.</E> Each handler holding reserve prunes for the account of the Committee shall maintain proper insurance thereon, including fire and extended coverage, in valuations (according to grade and/or size) established by, or acceptable to, the Committee for the particular crop year. The Committee shall reimburse the handler for the actual costs of such insurance. Prior to the receipt of reserve prunes at the beginning of each crop year, the handler shall certify to the Committee and the Secretary of Agriculture, on Form PMC 4.5, that such handler has a fire and extended coverage policy fully insuring all reserve prunes received by the handler during such crop year. Such certification shall contain the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) The name and address of the handler;</P>
                <P>(2) The location(s) where reserve prunes will be held for the account of the Committee and the premium rate per $100 value per annum at each location;</P>
                <P>(3) The value per ton at which the reserve prunes are insured; and</P>
                <P>(4) The name and address of the insurance underwriter.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Certain additional payments in connection with the holding of reserve prunes for the account of the Committee.</E> (1) Whenever a handler is directed by the Committee to move and dump containers or reserve prunes held by the <PRTPAGE P="663"/>handler for the account of the Committee for the purpose of causing an inspection to be made of the prunes as provided in § 993.75, but without taking delivery of the prunes at that time, the handler shall be paid for such services at a rate per ton (natural condition weight) determined by the Committee and approved by the Secretary of Agriculture. Such reimbursement rate shall be computed as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and publicized as required in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) Additional payment for reserve tonnage prunes held beyond the crop year of acquisition shall be made in accordance with this paragraph. Each handler holding reserve prunes shall complete such services so that the Committee is assured that the prunes are maintained in good condition.</P>
                <P>(i) For storage and necessary fumigation, each handler shall be compensated at a per ton rate announced by the Committee in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section:</P>
                <P>(A) For all or any part of the first 3 months of the succeeding crop year, the rate per ton shall be 10 percent of the yearly rate established for the crop year of acquisition;</P>
                <P>(B) For all or any part of the second 3 months of the succeeding crop year, the rate per ton shall be 50 percent of the rate established for the first 3 months of the succeeding crop year;</P>
                <P>(C) For all or any part of the third 3 months of the succeeding crop year, the rate per ton shall be 25 percent of the rate established for the first 3 months of the succeeding crop year;</P>
                <P>(D) For all or any part of the fourth 3 months of the succeeding crop year, the rate per ton shall be 25 percent of the rate established for the first 3 months of the succeeding crop year;</P>
                <P>(ii) For all or part of the succeeding crop year, the Committee shall determine the per ton rate for bin rental within the industry and announce bin rental rate to the industry pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) For insurance as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Certain additional payments in connection with the delivery of reserve prunes to the Committee or its designee.</E> (1) Whenever a handler is directed by the Committee to deliver to it or its designee reserve prunes in natural condition, the Committee shall furnish the handler with the containers in which to deliver the prunes, or reimburse the handler, at cost, for any containers which the handler furnishes pursuant to an agreement with the Committee.</P>
                <P>(2) Whenever the Committee arranges with a handler for the reserve prunes delivered to it or its designee to be in processed and packaged condition, the Committee shall reimburse the handler at the agreed rate, determined by the Committee to be reasonable, for the processing, container, and packaging costs.</P>
                <P>(e) The Committee shall give reasonable publicity to producer and handler members and alternates who serve on the Committee, commercial dehydrators, handlers, and the cooperative bargaining association(s) of each meeting to consider handler payment rates or any modification thereof, and each such meeting shall be open to them. Similar publicity shall be given to producer and handler members and alternates who serve on the Committee, commercial dehydrators, handlers, and the cooperative bargaining association(s) of each payment rate modification submitted to USDA for review and approval. The Committee shall notify producer and handler members and alternates who serve on the Committee, commercial dehydrators, handlers, and cooperative bargaining association(s) of USDA's action on payment rates and conditions for payment by first class mail and/or by electronic communications.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Voluntary prune plum diversion.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Quantity to be diverted.</E> The Committee shall indicate the quantity of prune plums that producers may divert pursuant to § 993.62 whenever it recommends to the Secretary that diversion operations for a crop year be permitted. Whenever diversion operation for a crop year have been authorized by <PRTPAGE P="664"/>the Secretary, the Committee shall notify producers, commercial dehydrators, and handlers, known to it of such authorization and diversion program procedures. The Committee shall compute the dried weight equivalent of prune plums so diverted on a dryaway basis as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For prune plums of the French variety, the Committee shall survey at least eight commercial prune dehydrators that are geographically dispersed within the production area to obtain their annual dryaway ratios for each of the preceding five crop years, and compute a five-year average dryaway ratio for each dehydrator. The Committee shall then add together the participating commercial dehydrators' five-year average dryaway ratios for each producing region within the production area, and divide the total by the number of participating commercial dehydrators in that region to compute the dryaway ratio by producing region. In the event any of the annual dryaway ratios for any of the crop years is abnormally high or low in any year, the Committee may replace the abnormal year's data with that of an earlier year. The prune producing regions for which dryaway ratios shall be computed for prune plums of the French variety are as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) North Sacramento Valley, which includes the counties of Butte, Glenn, Shasta, and Tehama;</P>
                <P>(ii) South Sacramento, Napa, Sonoma, and Santa Clara Valleys, which includes the counties of Amador, Colusa, Lake, Placer, Solano, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba, Napa, Sonoma, San Benito, and Santa Clara; and</P>
                <P>(iii) San Joaquin Valley, which includes the counties of Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare.</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">New producing counties within the area.</E> If there were new producing counties within the State of California, the Committee will, with the approval of the Secretary, assign the new prune producing county or counties, as the case may be, to one of the prune producing regions based on geographic proximity and/or production/dehydration characteristics. The addition of a county or counties, as the case may be, to one of the producing regions will be announced to the industry.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Removal of a county from a production area.</E> When prune acreage ceases to exist in a county, the Committee will, with the approval of the Secretary, remove that county from the existing region. Removal of a county from a production region also will be announced to the industry.</P>
                <P>(2) For prune plums of the non-French variety, the dryaway ratio shall be 1 pound for each 3.50 pounds of prune plums diverted. The prune-producing region for prune plums of non-French varieties is the State of California.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible diversions.</E> Eligible diversions shall preclude prune plums from becoming prunes and may include the following methods:</P>
                <P>(1) Disposing of harvested prune plums under Committee supervision for nonhuman use at a location and in a manner satisfactory to the Committee;</P>
                <P>(2) Leaving unharvested the entire production of prune plums from a solid block of bearing trees designated by the producer applying for the diversion of removing prune plum trees prior to harvest; and/or</P>
                <P>(3) Such other diversions as may be authorized by he Committee and approved by the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(4) In accordance with § 993.62(c), eligible diversion shall not apply to prune plums, which would not, under normal producer practices, be dried and delivered to a handler. On or before July 20 of each crop year when the Committee recommends a reserve pool and diversion program (except the Committee with the approval of the Secretary may extend this date by not more than 10 business days if warranted by a late crop), the Committee shall identify, with the approval of the Secretary, the acceptable method(s) of voluntary prune plum diversion through reasonable publicity to producers, commercial dehydrators, handlers, and the cooperative bargaining association(s). For the purposes of this section, cooperative bargaining association means a nonprofit cooperative association of dried prune producers engaged within the production area in bargaining with <PRTPAGE P="665"/>handlers as to price and otherwise arranging for the sale of natural condition dried prunes of its members.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Applications for diversion</E>—(1) <E T="03">By producers.</E> Each producer desiring to divert prune plums of his own production shall, prior to diversion, file with the Committee a certified application on Form PMC 10.1 “Application for Prune Plum Diversion” containing at least the following information:</P>
                <P>(i) The name and address of the producer; whether the producer is an owner-operator, share-landlord, share-tenant, or cash tenant; and the name and address of any other person or persons sharing a proprietary interest in such prune plums;</P>
                <P>(ii) The proposed method of diversion and the location where the diversion is to take place;</P>
                <P>(iii) The quantity and variety of prune plums proposed to be diverted; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The approximate period of diversion.</P>
                <P>(v) A deposit fee shall accompany each producer's application to cover costs associated with processing the application and administering the diversion program. The Committee shall compute, with the approval of the Secretary, and announce to the industry, the deposit fee. The deposit fee announced shall be a set dollar amount or a per ton cost based on the tonnage to be diverted. The fee paid by the applicant shall be the greater of these amounts.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">By dehydrator as agent.</E> Any producer, or group of producers, may authorize a dehydrator to act as an agent to divert harvested prune plums. Prior to diversion such dehydrator shall submit to the Committee an application on Form PMC 10.1 “Application for Prune Plum Diversion” for each producer or group of producers under contract with the dehydrator. A deposit fee shall accompany each such application to cover the costs associated with processing the application and administration of the program. With respect to any group of four or more producers under contract with a dehydrator, the deposit fee for the group shall be the greater of either double the single deposit fee, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the amount obtained by multiplying the total tonnage of prune plums to be diverted by the group of producers covered in the dehydrator's application times the per ton deposit rate announced by the Committee pursuant to (c)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Receipt of applications.</E> The Committee shall establish, and give prompt notice to the industry, a final date for receipt of applications for diversion: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Committee may extend such deadline if the total tonnage represented in all applications is substantially less than the total tonnage established by the Committee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval of applications.</E> No certificate of diversion shall be issued by the Committee unless it has approved the application covering such diversion.</P>
                <P>(1) The Committee's approval of an application shall be in writing, and include at least the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The details as to the method of diversion to be followed;</P>
                <P>(ii) The method of appraisal to be used by the Committee to determine the quantity of prune plums diverted;</P>
                <P>(iii) The lesser of either the quantity specified in the application to be diverted, or modification of that quantity as a result of any Committee action to prorate the total quantity to be diverted by all producers; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Such other information as may be necessary to assist the applicant in meeting the requirements of this section, including the conditions for proof of diversion.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Committee determines that it cannot approve an application it shall notify the applicant promptly. The Committee shall state the reason(s) for failing to approve the application, and request the applicant to submit, if practicable, an amended application correcting the deficiencies in the original application.</P>

                <P>(3) The Committee shall establish, and give prompt notice to the industry of a final date by which a producer or dehydrator may modify an approved application, including changing the method of diversion or the quantity of prune plums to be diverted: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any such change shall include information on the location or quantity <PRTPAGE P="666"/>of such diversion and shall be accompanied by a payment of a second deposit fee, calculated pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2), as applicable, of this section, plus a $2 per ton service charge for any increase in tonnage to be diverted.</P>
                <P>(4) If an applicant cancels an approved diversion application prior to diversion, no part of the deposit fee shall be refunded, except upon approval by the Committee following review of all circumstances in the matter.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Report of diversion.</E> (1) When diversion of prune plums has been completed, the diverter (whether producer or dehydrator as agent of a producer) shall submit the required proof of such diversion to the Committee. When the Committee concludes that diversion has been completed pursuant to the requirements of this section, it shall furnish the producer whose prune plums were diverted with a listing of the total quantity of prune plums concluded to be so diverted: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That a producer shall be given credit for any quantity of his prune plums diverted in excess of the quantity approved by the Committee pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section but not in excess of 120 percent of such approved quantity and then only to the extent that such creditable excess is already covered by his applicable deposit fee or such fee is increased by an additional deposit to cover such excess.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon completion of the computation of dryaway pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section applicable to the diverter's diversion of prune plums, the Committee shall issue a report of diversion to the producer whose prune plums were diverted for the total quantity, dried weight equivalent, credited for diversion setting forth the computations by which such total quantity was derived.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Transferable certificate of diversion</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> As hereinafter set forth, transferable certificates of diversion shall be issued by the Committee. Any transferable certificate of diversion issued to a handler that is a cooperative marketing association, or submitted to a handler and accepted by him, shall be returned to the Committee by the handler for credit against the handler's reserve obligation of the crop year in accordance with § 993.57. Such credit shall be based on the amount shown on the certificate, and shall be applied to reduce the handler's holding requirement for such crop year. With respect to such creditable certificate of a handler with a holding requirement prior to issuance or acceptance, as applicable, of the transferable certificate of diversion, such credit shall result in an adjustment downward in the handler's then applicable holding requirement in an amount equal to that computed by applying the applicable salable percentage to the total quantity on such certificate. Any adjustment in a handler's holding requirement shall not affect his obligation, if any, to continue to hold reserve prunes that are undersized prunes. The term <E T="03">undersized prunes</E> shall have the same meaning as prescribed by the Secretary for the then current crop year. If the Committee determines that effective administration of diversion operations requires establishment of a final date for submission of transferable certificates of diversion by producers to handlers, or a final date for return of such certificates by handlers to the Committee for crediting against their reserve obligations, or both, it shall establish such dates.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Issuance to producers.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the Committee shall issue transferable certificates of diversion to each producer diverting prune plums and to whom a report of diversion was issued. Prior to issuance of any such transferable certificate of diversion, the producer shall advise the Committee, in writing: (i) Of the name of the handler to whom the transferable certificate of diversion is to be submitted and who is holding reserve prunes referable to prunes received from such producer; and (ii) how much of the quantity shown on his report of diversion he desires to use in lieu of reserve prunes but not in excess of the quantity of reserve prunes referable to prunes received by the handler from such producer. The Committee shall enter on the transferable certificate of diversion the name of the handler and the quantity covered by the certificate. The transferable certificate of diversion shall be endorsed by the producer and <PRTPAGE P="667"/>the handler prior to its return to the Committee in order to be credited by the Committee against such handler's reserve obligation. If any portion of the quantity shown on the producer's report of diversion remains unused and he desires to transfer a transferable certificate of diversion covering all or any part of such unused portion to another producer, he shall advise the Committee, in writing, of the name and address of such producer, together with the applicable quantity desired to be covered by the transfer, and, if known, the name of the handler to whom such a transferable certificate is to be submitted. However, the quantity to be covered by the transfer shall not exceed the quantity of reserve prunes referable to prunes received by the handler from the transferee-producer. The Committee shall enter on the transferable certificate of diversion the names of the transferee-producer and the handler, and the quantity covered by the certificate. Prior to submission of any such transferred diversion certificate to a handler, the transferee-producer shall advise the Committee, in writing, of the name and address of the handler to whom the transferable certificate is to be submitted and who is holding reserve prunes referable to prunes received from such producer. Such transferred diversion certificate shall be endorsed by both producers and the handler in order to be credited by the Committee against such handler's reserve obligation.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Issuance to a cooperative marketing association.</E> In connection with prune plums diverted by producers who are members of a cooperative marketing association, the Committee shall, when so requested by the association, issue the applicable transferable certificates of diversion to it. The quantity entered on the report of diversion of a cooperative producer shall be entered on or annexed to the applicable transferable certificate of diversion issued to the association. Such transferable certificates of diversion shall be returned to the Committee by the association endorsed by an authorized officer of the association in order to be credited by the Committee against the association's reserve obligation.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicability of certain payments.</E> The provisions of §§ 993.59 and 993.159 governing payments to a handler for necessary services rendered by the handler in connection with reserve prunes shall not be applicable to prunes no longer required to be held as reserve prunes due to a downward adjustment by the Committee in the handler's holding requirement on the basis of applicable transferable certificates of diversion returned to the Committee.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Costs.</E> Pursuant to § 993.62(g), the costs pertaining to diversion are to be defrayed by payment of fees by the producer or cooperative marketing association to whom a diversion certificate is issued. After authorized diversion operations for a crop year are completed, the Committee shall ascertain its costs of diversion operations during such crop year. If the total amount represented by the deposit fees which accompanied the applications for diversion exceeds such costs, each producer, and each cooperative marketing association, entitled thereto shall receive a proportionate refund of the net amount. Such refund shall be calculated in the same proportion as the quantity of prune plums diverted by each such producer, and each such cooperative marketing association, is to the total quantity of prune plums diverted: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Committee may prescribe a minimum charge to cover costs of processing each application for diversion submitted to it.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification:</E> Each lot of shelled or cleaned- inshell peanuts intended for human consumption shall be identified by positive lot identification prior to being shipped or otherwise disposed of. Positive lot identification (PLI) methods are tailored to the size and containerization of the lot, by warehouse storage or space requirements, or by necessary further movement of the lot prior to certification. Positive lot identification is established by the Inspection Service and includes the following methods of identification. For domestic lots and repackaged import lots, PLI includes PLI stickers, tags or seals applied to each individual package or container in such a manner that is acceptable to the Inspection Service and maintains the identity of the lot. For imported lots, PLI tape may be used to wrap bags or boxes on pallets, PLI stickers may be used to cover the shrink-wrap overlap, doors may be sealed to isolate the lot, bags or boxes may be stenciled with a lot number, or any other means that is acceptable to the Inspection Service. The crop year means the calendar year in which the peanuts were planted as documented by the applicant. All lots of shelled and cleaned-inshell peanuts shall be shipped under positive lot identification procedures. However, peanut lots failing to meet quality requirements may be moved from a handler's facility to another facility owned by the same handler or another handler without PLI so long as such handler maintains a satisfactory records system for traceability purposes as defined in § 996.73.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sampling and testing shelled peanuts for outgoing Inspection:</E> Prior to shipment, the following sampling and inspection procedures shall be conducted on each lot of shelled peanuts intended for human consumption. The lot size of shelled or cleaned-inshell peanuts presented for outgoing inspection in bags or bulk shall not exceed 200,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>(1) Each handler or importer shall cause appropriate samples, based on a sampling plan approved by the Inspection Service, of each lot of shelled peanuts intended for human consumption to be drawn by the Inspection Service. The gross amount of peanuts drawn shall be large enough to provide for a grade analysis, for a grading check-sample, and for three 48-pound samples for aflatoxin chemical analysis. The three 48-pound samples shall be designated by the Inspection Service as “Sample 1,” “Sample 2,” and “Sample 3” and each sample shall be placed in a suitable container and positive lot identified by means acceptable to the Inspection Service. Sample 1 may be prepared for immediate testing or Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3 may be returned to the handler or importer for testing at a later date. Imported peanuts shall be labeled “Sample 1IMP,” “Sample 2IMP,” and “Sample 3IMP” and handled accordingly.</P>

              <P>(2) Before shipment of a lot of shelled peanuts to a buyer, the handler or importer shall cause Sample 1 to be ground by the Inspection Service, a USDA laboratory or a USDA-approved laboratory, in a “subsampling mill.” The resultant ground subsample from Sample 1 shall be of a size specified by the Inspection Service and shall be designated as “Subsample 1-AB” and at the handler's, importer's or buyer's option, a second subsample may also be extracted from Sample 1. It shall be designated as “Subsample 1-CD.” Subsample 1-CD may be sent as requested by the handler or buyer, for aflatoxin assay, to a USDA laboratory or USDA-approved laboratory that can provide analyses results on such samples in 36 hours. The cost of sampling and testing Subsample 1-CD shall be for the account of the applicant. Subsample 1-AB shall be analyzed only in a USDA laboratory or USDA-approved laboratory. Both Subsamples 1-AB and 1-CD shall be accompanied by a notice of sampling or grade certificate, signed by the inspector, containing, at least, identifying information as to the handler or importer, and the positive lot identification of the shelled peanuts.<PRTPAGE P="677"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The samples designated as Sample 2 and Sample 3 shall be held as aflatoxin check-samples by the Inspection Service or the handler or importer and shall not be included in the shipment to the buyer until the analyses results from Sample 1 are known.</P>
              <P>(4) Upon call from the laboratory, the handler or importer shall cause Sample 2 to be ground by the Inspection Service, USDA or USDA-approved laboratory in a “subsampling mill.” The resultant ground subsample from Sample 2 shall be of a size specified by the Inspection Service and it shall be designated as “Subsample 2-AB.” Upon call from the laboratory, the handler shall cause Sample 3 to be ground by the Inspection Service, USDA or USDA-approved laboratory in a “subsampling mill.” The resultant ground subsample from Sample 3 shall be of a size specified by Inspection Service and shall be designated as “Subsample 3-AB.” “Subsamples 2-AB and 3-AB” shall be analyzed only in a USDA laboratory or a USDA-approved laboratory and each shall be accompanied by a notice of sampling. The results of each assay shall be reported by the laboratory to the handler and to USDA.</P>
              <P>(5) Handlers and importers may make arrangements for required inspection and certification by contacting the Inspection Service office closest to where the peanuts will be made available for sampling. For questions regarding inspection services, a list of Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service offices, or for further assistance, handlers and importers may contact: Specialty Crops Inspection Division, Specialty Crops Program, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Room 1536-S, (STOP 0240), Washington, DC, 20250-0240; Telephone: (202) 720-5870; Fax: (202) 720-0393.</P>
              <P>(6) Handlers and importers may make arrangements for required chemical analysis for aflatoxin content at the nearest USDA or USDA-approved laboratory. For further information concerning chemical analysis and a list of laboratories authorized to conduct such analysis contact: Science and Technology Program, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., STOP 0270, Washington, DC 20250-0270; Telephone (202) 690-0621; Fax (202) 720-4631.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reconditioning failing quality peanuts.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Lots of peanuts which have not been certified as meeting the requirements for disposition to human consumption outlets may be disposed for non-human consumption uses: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That each such lot is positive lot identified using red tags, identified using a traceability system as defined in § 996.73, or other methods acceptable to the Inspection Service, and certified as to aflatoxin content (actual numerical count), unless they are designated for crushing. However, on the shipping papers covering the disposition of each such lot, the handler or importer shall cause the following statement to be shown: “The peanuts covered by this bill of lading (or invoice, etc.) are not to be used for human consumption.”</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Sheller oil stock residuals shall be positive lot identified using red tags, identified using a traceability system as defined in § 996.73, or other methods acceptable to the Inspection <PRTPAGE P="678"/>Service, and may be disposed of domestically or to the export market in bulk or bags or other suitable containers. Disposition to crushing may be to approved crushers. However, sheller oil stock residuals may be moved from a handler's facility to another facility owned by the same handler or another handler without PLI so long as such handler maintains a satisfactory records system for traceability purposes as defined in § 996.73.</P>
              <P>(2) If such peanuts are not tested and certified as to aflatoxin content, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the handler or importer shall cause the following statement to be shown on the shipping papers: “The peanuts covered by this bill of lading (or invoice, etc.) are limited to crushing only and may contain aflatoxin.”</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Remilling.</E> Handlers and importers may remill, or cause to have remilled, lots of shelled or cleaned-inshell peanuts failing to meet the applicable outgoing quality standards in the table in § 996.31(a). If, after remilling, such peanut lot meets the applicable quality standards in § 996.31, the lot may be moved for human consumption under positive lot identification procedures and accompanied by applicable grade and aflatoxin certificates.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Blanching.</E> Handlers and importers may blanch, or cause to have blanched, shelled peanuts failing to meet the outgoing quality standards specified in the table in § 996.31(a). If after blanching, such peanut lot meets the quality standards in § 996.31(a), the lot may be moved for human consumption under positive lot identification procedures and accompanied by applicable grade and aflatoxin certificates. Peanut lots certified as meeting the fall through standard or the damaged kernels and minor defects standard as specified in § 996.31(a), prior to blanching shall be exempt from fall through, damaged kernels and minor defects standards after blanching.</P>

              <P>(e) Lots of shelled peanuts moved for remilling or blanching shall be positive lot identified and accompanied by valid grade inspection certificate, <E T="03">Except</E> That, a handler's shelled peanuts may be moved without PLI and grade inspection to the handler's blanching facility that blanches only the handler's peanuts. Lots of shelled peanuts may be moved for remilling or blanching to another handler without PLI if the handler uses a traceability system as defined in § 996.73, <E T="03">Except</E> That, any grade inspection certificates associated with these lots would no longer be valid. The title of such peanuts shall be retained by the handler or importer until the peanuts have been certified by the Inspection Service as meeting the outgoing quality standards specified in the table in § 996.31(a). Remilling or blanching under the provisions of this paragraph shall be performed only by those remillers and blanchers approved by USDA. Such approved entities must agree to comply with the handling standards in this part and to report dispositions of all failing peanuts and residual peanuts to USDA, unless they are designated for crushing.</P>

              <P>(f) Residual peanuts resulting from remilling or blanching of peanuts shall be red tagged, identified using a traceability system as defined in § 996.73, or identified by other means acceptable to the Inspection Service, and returned directly to the handler for further disposition or, in the alternative, such residual peanuts shall be positive lot identified by the Inspection Service and shall be disposed of to handlers who are crushers, or to approved crushers, <E T="03">Except</E> That, a handler may move the residual peanuts without PLI to a facility for crushing owned by the handler. Handlers who are crushers and crushers approved by USDA must agree to comply with the terms and conditions of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Re-inspection.</E> Whenever USDA has reason to believe that domestic or imported peanuts may have been damaged or deteriorated while in storage, USDA may reject the then effective inspection certificate and may require the owner of the peanuts to have a re-inspection to establish whether or not such peanuts may be disposed of for human consumption.</P>

              <P>(h) The cost of transportation, sampling, inspection, certification, chemical analysis, and identification, as well as remilling and blanching, and further inspection of remilled and blanched lots, and disposition of failing peanuts, shall be borne by the applicant. Whenever peanuts are presented <PRTPAGE P="679"/>for inspection, the handler or importer shall furnish any labor and pay any costs incurred in moving, opening containers, and shipping samples as may be necessary for proper sampling and inspection. The Inspection Service shall bill the applicant or other responsible entity separately for applicable fees covering sampling and inspection, delivering aflatoxin samples to laboratories, positive lot identification measures, and other certifications as may be necessary to certify edible quality or non-edible disposition. The USDA and USDA-approved laboratories shall bill the applicant or other responsible entity separately for applicable fees for aflatoxin assays.</P>

However, all peanuts entered for human consumption use must be certified as meeting the quality standards specified in § 996.31(a) prior to such disposition. Failure to fully comply with quality and handling standards as required under this section, will result enforcement action by USDA.</P>
              <P>(2) Imported peanut lots sampled and inspected at the port-of-entry, or at other locations, shall meet the quality standards of this part in effect on the date of inspection.</P>

              <P>(3) A foreign-produced peanut lot entered for consumption or for warehouse may be transferred or sold to another person: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the original importer shall be the importer of record unless the new owner applies for bond and files Customs Service documents pursuant to 19 CFR 141.113 and 141.20: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That such peanuts must be certified and reported to USDA pursuant to § 996.71 of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) The provisions of this section do not supersede any restrictions or prohibitions on peanuts under the Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, any other applicable laws, or regulations of other Federal agencies, including import regulations and procedures of the Customs Service.</P>

              <P>(b) Reports shall be maintained by the handler for nonconforming products to assure traceability throughout the supply chain. The traceability system must include documented records, which enable a full product history to be produced in a timely manner and must ensure product can be traced forward (raw material to distribution) and backwards from distribution to the warehouse feeding the shelling plant, and ensure that all associated tests and all relevant records have been completed. The traceability system shall include identification of all raw materials, process parameters (for specific lot), packaging and final disposition. The handler shall be able to identify the warehouse in which the peanuts were stored immediately prior to shelling. Traceability must be maintained throughout production runs with specific lot codes, and there shall be complete linkage from raw material receipt through final disposition.</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Aflatoxin testing.</E> Importers may make arrangements for required chemical analysis for aflatoxin content at the nearest USDA or USDA-accredited laboratory. For further information concerning chemical analysis and a list of laboratories authorized to conduct such analysis contact: Science and Technology Programs, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., STOP 0270, Washington, DC 20250-0270; Telephone: (202) 720-5231; Fax: (202) 720-6496.</P>
            <P>(1) Aflatoxin test samples shall be received and logged by a USDA or USDA-accredited laboratory, and each test sample shall be prepared and analyzed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or the AOAC-approved immunoaffinity column with direct fluorometry method. The aflatoxin level shall be calculated on a kernel weight basis.</P>

            <P>(2) Lots that require a single test sample will be certified as “negative” on the aflatoxin inspection certificate if the sample has an aflatoxin level at or below 15 ppb. If the aflatoxin level is above 15 ppb, the lot fails and the laboratory shall fill out an <E T="03">Imported Pistachios—Failed Lot Notification</E> report (Form FV-249) as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) Lots that require two test samples will be certified as “negative” on the aflatoxin inspection certificate if Test Sample #1 has an aflatoxin level at or below 10 ppb. If the aflatoxin level of Test Sample #1 is above 20 ppb, the lot fails and the laboratory shall fill out an <E T="03">Imported Pistachios—Failed Lot Notification</E> report (Form FV-249). If the aflatoxin level of Test Sample #1 is above 10 ppb and at or below 20 ppb, the laboratory may, at the importer's discretion, analyze Test Sample #2 and average the test results of Test Samples #1 and #2. Alternately, the importer may elect to withdraw the lot from testing, rework the lot, and resubmit it for testing after reworking. If the importer directs the laboratory to proceed with the analysis of Test Sample #2, a lot will be certified as negative to aflatoxin and the laboratory shall issue an aflatoxin inspection certificate if the averaged result of Test Samples #1 and #2 is at or below 15 ppb. If the average aflatoxin level of Test Samples #1 and #2 is above 15 ppb, the lot fails and the laboratory shall fill out an <E T="03">Imported Pistachios—Failed Lot Notification</E> report (Form FV-249).</P>
            <P>(4) If an importer does not elect to use Test Sample #2 for certification purposes, the importer may request that the laboratory return the sample to the importer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Each lot of pistachios sampled and tested in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be covered by an aflatoxin inspection certificate completed by the laboratory. The certification expires for the lot or remainder of the lot after 12 months. Each such certificate shall set forth the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The date and place of sampling and testing.</P>
            <P>(2) The name of the applicant.</P>
            <P>(3) The Customs entry number pertaining to the lot or shipment covered by the certificate.</P>
            <P>(4) The quantity and identifying marks of the lot tested.</P>
            <P>(5) The aflatoxin level of the lot, stated on a kernel weight basis.</P>

            <P>(6) The statement, if applicable: “Meets U.S. import requirements under section 8e of the AMA Act of 1937.”<PRTPAGE P="695"/>
            </P>
            <P>(7) If the lot fails to meet the import requirements, a statement to that effect and the reasons therefore.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Failed lots/rework procedure.</E> Any lot or portion thereof that fails to meet the import requirements prior to or after reconditioning may be exported, sold for non-human consumption, or disposed of under the supervision of Customs and, if necessary for verification purposes, the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Programs, with the costs of certifying the disposal of such lot paid by the importer.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Inshell rework procedure for aflatoxin.</E> If inshell rework is selected as a remedy to meet the aflatoxin requirements of this part, then 100 percent of the product within that lot shall be removed from the bulk and/or retail packaging containers and reworked to remove the portion of the lot that caused the failure. Reworking shall consist of mechanical, electronic, or manual procedures normally used in the handling of pistachios. After the rework procedure has been completed, the total weight of the accepted product and the total weight of the rejected product shall be reported by the importer to Customs and USDA on an <E T="03">Imported Pistachios—Rework and Failed Lot Disposition</E> report (Form FV-251) as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The reworked lot shall be sampled and tested for aflatoxin as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, except that the lot sample size and the test sample size shall be doubled. If, after the lot has been reworked and tested, it fails the aflatoxin test for a second time, the lot may be shelled and the kernels reworked, sampled, and tested in the manner specified for an original lot of kernels, or the failed lot may be exported, used for non-human consumption, or otherwise disposed of.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Kernel rework procedure for aflatoxin.</E> If pistachio kernel rework is selected as a remedy to meet the aflatoxin requirements of this part, then 100 percent of the product within that lot shall be removed from the bulk and/or retail packaging containers and reworked to remove the portion of the lot that caused the failure. Reworking shall consist of mechanical, electronic, or manual procedures normally used in the handling of pistachios. After the rework procedure has been completed the total weight of the accepted product and the total weight of the rejected product shall be reported to Customs and USDA on an <E T="03">Imported Pistachios—Rework and Failed Lot Disposition</E> report (Form FV-251). The reworked lot shall be sampled and tested for aflatoxin as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Failed lot reporting.</E> If a lot fails to meet the aflatoxin requirements of this part, the testing laboratory shall complete an <E T="03">Imported Pistachios—Failed Lot Notification</E> report (Form FV-249) as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and shall submit it to Customs, the importer, and USDA within 10 working days of the test failure. This form must be completed and submitted each time a lot fails aflatoxin testing.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Reports and Recordkeeping.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Form FV-249 Imported Pistachios—Failed Lot Notification.</E> Each USDA or USDA-accredited laboratory shall notify the importer; Customs; and the Marketing Order and Agreement Division, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, USDA; of all lots that fail to meet the maximum aflatoxin requirements by completing this form and submitting it within 10 days of failed aflatoxin testing.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Form FV-251 Imported Pistachios—Rework and Failed Lot Disposition.</E> Each importer who reworks a failing lot of pistachios shall complete this report and shall forward it to Customs and the Marketing Order and Agreement Division, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, USDA, no later than 10 days after the rework is completed. If rework is not selected as a remedy, the importer shall complete and submit this form within 10 days of alternate disposition of the lot.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> Any importer may import pistachios free of the requirements of this section if such importer imports a quantity not exceeding a total of 5,000 dried pounds between September 1 and August 31 of each year. Substandard pistachios imported for use in non-human consumption outlets shall be subject to the safeguard provisions contained in § 999.500.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Reconditioning prior to importation.</E> Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to preclude reconditioning <PRTPAGE P="696"/>pistachios prior to importation, in order that such pistachios may be made eligible to meet the applicable aflatoxin regulations prescribed in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Comingling.</E> Certified lots of pistachios may be comingled with other certified lots, but the comingling of certified lots and uncertified lots shall cause the loss of certification for the comingled lots.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Retesting.</E> Whenever USDA has reason to believe that imported pistachios may have been damaged or deteriorated while in storage, USDA may reject the then effective inspection certificate and may require the owner of the pistachios to have them retested to establish whether or not such pistachios may be shipped for human consumption.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be subject to a forfeiture in the amount prescribed in section 8a(5) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), or, upon conviction, a penalty in the amount prescribed in section 8c(14) of the said Act, or to both such forfeiture and penalty. False representation to any agency of the United States on any matter within its jurisdiction, knowing it to be false, is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides for a fine or imprisonments or both.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Other import requirements.</E> The provisions of this section do not supersede any restrictions or prohibitions on pistachios under the Federal Plant Quarantine Act of 1912, or any other applicable laws or regulations of city, county, State, or Federal Agencies including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</P>
