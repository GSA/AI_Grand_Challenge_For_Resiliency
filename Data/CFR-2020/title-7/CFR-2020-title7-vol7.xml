      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Administration.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Subject to the availability of funds, this part provides the terms, conditions and requirements of the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). <PRTPAGE P="8"/>Neither program is an entitlement program and payments will only be made to the extent that the Deputy Administrator announces the eligibility of benefits for certain natural disasters, the areas in which such benefits will be available, the time period in which the disaster and the rehabilitation must occur, and only so long as all the conditions for eligibility specified in this part and elsewhere in law are met. However, the Deputy Administrator will not apply any non-statutory limitation on payments provided for in this part in such a way that it would necessarily result in the non-expenditure of program funds required to otherwise be made by law.</P>
                <P>(b) ECP and EFRP are administered by the Administrator, FSA through the Deputy Administrator, FSA, and shall be carried out in the field by State and county FSA committees (State and county committees), subject to the availability of funds. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, discretionary determinations to be made under this rule will be made by the Deputy Administrator. Matters committed to the discretion of the Deputy Administrator shall be considered in all cases to be permissive powers and no person or legal entity shall, under any circumstances, be considered to be entitled to an exercise of such power in their favor.</P>
                <P>(c) State and county committees, and representatives and employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any regulations in this part.</P>
                <P>(d) The State committee may take any action authorized or required of the county committee by this part, but which the county committee has not taken, such as:</P>
                <P>(1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part; or</P>
                <P>(2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.</P>
                <P>(e) No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee shall preclude the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.</P>
                <P>(f) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the program.</P>
                <P>(g) The Deputy Administrator may limit the authority of state and county committees to approve cost share in excess of specified amounts.</P>
                <P>(h) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, the failure to provide data could result in program benefits being withheld or denied.</P>
                <P>(i) FSA may consult with any other Federal agency, State agency, or other provider of technical assistance for such assistance as is determined by FSA to be necessary to implement ECP or EFRP. FSA is responsible for the technical aspects of ECP and EFRP but may enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with another party to provide technical assistance. If the requirement for technical assistance results in undue delay or significant hardship to producers in a county, the State committee may request in writing that FSA waive this requirement for that county. However, nothing in this paragraph or in this part creates a right of appeal or action for an applicant with respect to provisions relating to internal procedures of FSA.</P>
                <P>(j) The provisions in this part shall not create an entitlement in any person or legal entity to any ECP or EFRP cost share or claim or any particular notice or form or procedure.</P>
                <P>(k) Additional terms and conditions may be set forth in the application or the forms participants will be required to sign for participation in the ECP or EFRP.</P>

              <P>(a) Where any person who would otherwise be eligible to receive a payment dies before the payment is received, payment may be released in accordance with this section so long as, and only if, a timely program application has been filed by the deceased before <PRTPAGE P="21"/>the death or filed in a timely way before or after the death by a person legally authorized to act for the deceased.

              <P>(4) If there is no surviving spouse and no direct descendant, payment shall be made to the father and mother of the deceased person in equal shares, or the whole thereof to the surviving father or mother.</P>
              <P>(5) If there is no surviving spouse, no direct descendant, and no surviving parent, payment shall be made to the brothers and sisters of the deceased person in equal shares. Children of a deceased brother or sister shall be entitled to their parent's share of the payment, share and share alike. If there are no surviving direct descendants of the deceased brother or sister of such deceased person, the share of the payment which otherwise would have been made to such brother or sister shall be divided equally among the surviving brothers and sisters of such deceased person and the estates of any deceased brothers or sisters where there are surviving direct descendants.</P>
              <P>(6) If there is no surviving spouse, direct descendant, parent, or brothers or sisters or their descendants, the payment shall be made to the heirs-at-law in accordance with the law of the State of domicile of the deceased person.</P>
              <P>(b) If any person who is entitled to payment under the above order of precedence is a minor, payment of his share shall be made to his legal guardian, but if no legal guardian has been appointed payment shall be made to his natural guardian or custodian for his benefit, unless the minor's share of the payment exceeds $1,000, in which event payment shall be made only to his legal guardian.</P>
              <P>(c) Any payment which the deceased person could have received may be made jointly to the persons found to be entitled to such payment or shares thereof under this section or, pursuant to instructions issued by the Farm Service Agency, a separate payment may be issued to each person entitled to share in such payment.</P>

              <P>(b) A person shall be deemed to have disappeared if (1) he has been missing for a period of more than 3 months, (2) a diligent search has failed to reveal his whereabouts, and (3) such person has not communicated during such period with other persons who would be expected to have heard from him. Evidence of such disappearance must be presented to the county committee in the form of a statement executed by the person making the application for payment, setting forth the above facts, and must be substantiated by a statement from a disinterested person who was well acquainted with the person who has disappeared.</P>

              <P>(a) Where any person who would otherwise be eligible to receive a payment is adjudged incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction before the payment is received, payment may be released in accordance with this section so long as, and only if, a timely and binding program application has been filed by the person involved while capable or by someone legally authorized to file an application for the person involved. Timeliness is determined under the relevant program regulations. In all cases, the payment application must have been timely under the relevant program regulations and all program conditions for payment must have been met by or on behalf of the person involved.

If these conditions are met, payment may be released without regard to the claims of creditors other than the United States, to the guardian or committee legally appointed for the person involved. In case no guardian or committee had been appointed, payment, if for not more than $1,000, may be released without regard to claims of creditors other than the United States, to one of the following in the following order for the benefit of the person who was the subject of the adjudication:</P>
              <P>(1) The spouse.</P>
              <P>(2) An adult son, daughter, or grandchild.</P>
              <P>(3) The mother or father.</P>
              <P>(4) An adult brother or sister.</P>
              <P>(5) Such person as may be authorized under State law to receive payment for the person (see standard procedure prescribed for the respective region).</P>
              <P>(b) In case payment is more than $1,000, payment may be released only to such person as may be authorized under State law to receive payment for the incompetent, so long as all conditions for other payments specified in paragraph (a) of this section and elsewhere in the applicable regulations have been met. Those requirements include the filing of a proper and timely and legally authorized program application by or for the person adjudged incompetent. The release of funds under this paragraph will be made without regard to claims of creditors other than the United States unless the agency determines otherwise.</P>

But, further, for the payment to be released under the rules of this part, a second application must be filed. That second application is a release application filed under this section. In particular, as to the latter, where all other conditions have been met, persons desiring to claim payment for themselves or an estate in accordance with this part 707 must do so by filing a release application on Form FSA-325, “Application for Payment of Amounts Due Persons Who Have Died, Disappeared or Have Been Declared Incompetent.If the person who died, disappeared, or was declared incompetent did not apply for payment by filing the applicable program application for payment form, such program application for payment must also be filed in accordance with applicable regulations. If the payment is made under the Naval Stores Conservation Program, Part II of the Form FSA-325 shall be executed by the local District Supervisor of the U.S. Forest Service. In connection with applications for payment under all other programs itemized in § 707.1, Form FSA-325, and program applications for payments where required, shall be filed with the FSA county office where the person who earned the payment would have been required to file his application.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Administrative county and servicing FSA county office.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) FSA farm records are maintained in an administrative county determined by FSA. Generally, a farm's administrative county is based on the physical location county of the farm. If all land on the farm is physically located in one physical location county, the farm's records will be administratively located in that physical location county.</P>
                <P>(b) In cases where there is no FSA office in the county in which the farm is physically located or where a servicing FSA county office is responsible for more than one administrative county, the farm records will be administratively located as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and with a servicing FSA county office that FSA as designated as responsible for that administrative county.</P>
                <P>(c) Farm operators and owners can conduct their farm's business in any FSA county office. FSA's designation of a farm's administrative county is based on where land of the farm is located as specified in paragraph (a) of this section or as might be required under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) Farm operators and owners can request a change to their servicing FSA county office and that request may necessitate a change to the farm's administrative county as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. If the requested servicing FSA county office is not responsible for and does not have an administrative county for the physical location of the farm according to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and FSA approves the request for change of servicing FSA county office, FSA will designate the administrative county for the farm from those available in the requested servicing FSA county office.</P>
                <P>(e) If a county contiguous to the county in which the farm is physically located in the same State does not have a servicing FSA county office, the farm will be administratively located by FSA in a contiguous county in another contiguous State that is convenient to the farm operator and owner. Requests for changes to a farm's servicing FSA county office, which may or may not result in a change to a farm's administrative county under this section, must be submitted to FSA by August 1 of each year for the change to take effect that calendar year.</P>
                <P>(f) When land on the farm is physically located in more than one county, the farm will be administered by a servicing FSA county office determined by FSA to be the administrative county responsibility for administration of programs for one or more of the physical counties involved in the farm's constitution. Paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section applies if changes occur to the servicing FSA county office and administrative county.</P>
                <P>(g) Farm operators and owners cannot request a change to a farm's administrative county. The operator and owner of a farm serviced by an FSA county office responsible for a farm's administrative county can request a change of servicing FSA county office to another FSA servicing county office in the same State by August 1 for the change to take effect that calendar year. Review and approval of any change to the servicing FSA county office is solely at the discretion of FSA. Requests for change in servicing FSA county office, which may or may not result in a change to a farm's administrative county, will be reviewed and approved by county committee if all the following can be determined to apply:</P>
                <P>(1) The requested change does not impact the constitution of a farm;</P>

                <P>(c) An individual; duly authorized officer of a corporation; duly authorized partner of a partnership; executor or administrator of an estate; trustee of a trust; guardian; or conservator may delegate to another the authority to act on their behalf with respect to FSA and CCC programs administered by USDA service center agencies by execution of a Power of Attorney, or such other form as approved by the Deputy Administrator. FSA and CCC may, at their discretion, allow the delegations of authority by other individuals through use of the Power of Attorney or such other form as approved by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(d) Notwithstanding another provision of this regulation or any other FSA or CCC regulation in this title, a parent may execute documents on behalf of a minor child unless prohibited by a statute or court order.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Prevented planted and failed acreage.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Prevented planting is the inability to plant an eligible crop with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC. The eligible cause of loss that prevented the planting must have:</P>
                <P>(1) Occurred after a previous planting period for the crop;</P>
                <P>(2) Occurred before the final planting date for the crop in the applicable crop year or, in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and</P>
                <P>(3) Similarly affected other producers in the area, as determined by CCC.</P>
                <P>(b) FSA may approve acreage as “prevented planted acreage” if all other conditions for such approval are met and provided the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section are met.</P>
                <P>(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, producers must report the acreage, on forms specified by FSA, within 15 calendar days after the final planting date determined for the crop by FSA.</P>
                <P>(2) If the acreage is reported after the period identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the application must be filed in time to permit:</P>
                <P>(i) The county committee or its authorized representative to make a farm visit to verify eligible disaster conditions that prevented the specified acreage or crop from being planted; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The county committee or its authorized representative the opportunity to determine, based on visual inspection, that the acreage or crop in question was affected by eligible disaster conditions such as damaging weather or other adverse natural occurrences that prevented the acreage or crop from being planted.</P>
                <P>(3) A farm visit to inspect the acreage or crop is required for all late-filed acreage reports where prevented planting credit is sought. Under no circumstance may acreage reported after the 15-day period referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section be deemed acceptable unless the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. State and county committees do not have the authority to waive the field inspection and verification provisions for late-filed reports.</P>

                <P>(4) All determinations made during field inspections must be documented on each late-filed acreage report, with <PRTPAGE P="39"/>results also recorded in county committee minutes to support the documentation.</P>
                <P>(5) The acreage must have been prevented from being planted as the result of a natural disaster and not a management decision.</P>
                <P>(6) The prevented planted acreage report was approved by the county committee. The county committee may disapprove prevented planted acreage credit if it is not satisfied with the documentation provided.</P>
                <P>(c) To receive prevented planted credit for acreage, the producer must show to the satisfaction of FSA that the producer intended to plant the acreage. Documentation supporting such intent includes documents related to field preparation, seed purchase, and any other information that shows the acreage could and would have been planted and harvested absent the natural disaster or eligible cause of loss that prevented the planting.</P>
                <P>(d) Prevented planted acreage credit will not be given to crops where the prevented-planted acreage was affected by drought, unless:</P>
                <P>(1) On the final planting date for non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and progress toward crop maturity because of a prolonged period of dry weather, as determined by CCC; and</P>
                <P>(2) Prolonged precipitation deficiencies exceeded the D2 level as determined using the U.S. Drought Monitor; and</P>
                <P>(3) Verifiable information is collected from sources whose business or purpose it is to record weather conditions, as determined by CCC, and including but not limited to the local weather reporting stations of the U.S. National Weather Service.</P>
                <P>(e) Prevented planted acreage credit under this part applies to irrigated crops where the acreage was prevented from being planted due to a lack of water resulting from drought conditions or contamination by saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought conditions if there was not a reasonable probability of having adequate water to carry out an irrigation practice.</P>
                <P>(f) Acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage includes, but is not limited to, acreage:</P>
                <P>(1) With respect to which the planting history or conservation plans indicate it would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes;</P>
                <P>(2) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program administered by USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs;</P>
                <P>(3) Not planted because of a management decision;</P>
                <P>(4) Affected by the containment or release of water by any governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of water;</P>
                <P>(5) Where any other person receives a prevented planted payment for any crop for the same crop year, unless the acreage meets all the requirements for double cropping under this part;</P>
                <P>(6) Where pasture or other forage crop is in place on the acreage during the time that planting of the crop generally occurs in the area;</P>
                <P>(7) Where another crop is planted (previous or subsequent) that does not meet the double cropping definition;</P>
                <P>(8) Where any volunteer or cover crop is hayed, grazed, or otherwise harvested on the acreage for the same crop year;</P>
                <P>(9) Where there is an inadequate supply of irrigation water beginning on the Federal crop insurance sale closing date for the previous crop year or the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) application closing date for the crop as specified in part 1437 of this title through the final planting date of the current year;</P>
                <P>(10) On which a failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities, unless the failure or breakdown is due to a natural disaster;</P>
                <P>(11) That is under quarantine imposed by a county, State, or Federal government agency;</P>
                <P>(12) That is affected by chemical or herbicide residue, unless the residue is due to a natural disaster;</P>
                <P>(13) That is affected by drifting herbicide;<PRTPAGE P="40"/>
                </P>
                <P>(14) On which a crop was produced, but the producer was unable to obtain a market for the crop;</P>
                <P>(15) Involving a planned planting of a “value loss crop” as that term is defined for NAP as specified in part 1437 of this title, including, but not limited to, Christmas trees, aquaculture, or ornamental nursery, for which NAP assistance is provided under value loss procedure;</P>
                <P>(16) For which the claim for prevented planted credit relates to trees or other perennials unless the producer can prove resources were available to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as applicable;</P>
                <P>(17) That is affected by wildlife damage;</P>
                <P>(18) Upon which, the reduction in the water supply for irrigation is due to participation in an electricity buy-back program, or the sale of water under a water buy-back or legislative changes regarding water usage, or any other cause which is not a natural disaster; or</P>
                <P>(19) That is devoted to non-cropland.</P>
                <P>(g) CCC may allow exceptions to acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage when surface water or ground water is reduced because of a natural disaster (as determined by CCC).</P>
                <P>(h) Failed acreage is acreage that was planted with the proper equipment during the planting period but failed as a result of an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.</P>
                <P>(i) To be approved by CCC as failed acreage the acreage must have been reported as failed acreage before disposition of the crop, and the acreage must have been planted under normal conditions but failed as the result of a natural disaster and not a management decision. Producers who file a failed acreage report must have the request acted on by the county committee. The county committee will deny the acreage report if it is not satisfied with the documentation provided.</P>
                <P>(j) To receive failed acreage credit the producer must show all of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) That the acreage was planted under normal conditions using the proper equipment with the intent to harvest the acreage.</P>
                <P>(2) Provide documentation that the crop was planted using farming practices consistent for the crop and area, but could not be brought to harvest because of disaster-related conditions.</P>
                <P>(k) The eligible cause for failed acreage must have:</P>
                <P>(1) Occurred after the crop was planted, and</P>
                <P>(2) Before the normal harvest date for the crop in the applicable crop year or in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and</P>
                <P>(3) Other producers in the area were similarly affected as determined by CCC.</P>
                <P>(l) Eligible failed acreage will be determined on the basis of the producer planting the crop under normal conditions with the expectation to take the crop to harvest.</P>
                <P>(m) Acreage ineligible for failed acreage credit includes, but is not limited to acreage:</P>
                <P>(1) Which was planted using methods that could not be considered normal for the area and without the expectation of harvest;</P>
                <P>(2) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been un-harvested under any program administered by USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs; or</P>
                <P>(3) That failed because of a management decision.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Measuring acreage including skip row acreage.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When one crop is alternating with another crop, whether or not both crops have the same growing season, only the acreage that is actually planted to the crop being measured will be considered to be acreage devoted to the measured crop.</P>
                <P>(b) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and section, whether planted in a skip row pattern or without a pattern of skipped rows, the entire acreage of the field or subdivision may be considered as devoted to the crop only where the distance between the rows, for all rows, is 40 inches or less. If there is a skip that creates idle land wider than 40 inches, or if the distance between any rows is more than 40 inches, then the area planted to the crop shall be considered to be that area which would represent the smaller of; a 40 inch width between rows, or the normal row spacing in the field for all other rows in the field—those that are not more than 40 inches apart. The allowance for individual rows would be made based on the smaller of actual spacing between those rows or the normal spacing in the field. For example, if the crop is planted in single, wide rows that are 48 inches apart, only 20 inches to either side of each row (for a total of 40 inches between the two rows) could, at a maximum, be considered as devoted as the crop and normal spacing in the field would control. Half the normal distance between rows will also be allowed beyond the outside planted rows not to exceed 20 inches and will reflect normal spacing in the field.</P>
                <P>(c) In making calculations under this section, further reductions may be made in the acreage considered planted if it is determined that the acreage is more sparsely planted than normal using reasonable and customary full production planting techniques.</P>
                <P>(d) The Deputy Administrator has the discretionary authority to allow row allowances other than those specified in this section in those instances in which crops are normally planted with spacings greater or less than 40 inches, such as in case of tobacco, or where other circumstances are present which the Deputy Administrator finds justifies that allowance.</P>
                <P>(e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall apply with respect to the 2003 and subsequent crops. For preceding crops, the rules in effect on January 1, 2002, shall apply.</P>

                <P>(a) Any contiguous area which is not devoted to the crop being measured and which is not part of a skip-row pattern under § 718.108 shall be deducted from the acreage of the crop if such area meets the following minimum national standards or requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) A minimum width of 30 inches;</P>
                <P>(2) For tobacco—three-hundredths (.03) acre. Turn areas, terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, non-cropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 inches in width may be combined to meet the 0.03-acre minimum requirement; or</P>
                <P>(3) For all other crops and land uses—one-tenth (.10) acre. Turn areas, terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, non-cropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 inches in width and each of which contain 0.1 acre or more may be combined to meet any larger minimum prescribed for a State in accordance with this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) If the area not devoted to the crop is located within the planted area, the part of any perimeter area that is more than 217.8 feet (33 links) in width will be considered to be an internal deduction if the standard deduction is used.</P>
                <P>(c) A standard deduction of 3 percent of the area devoted to a row crop and zero percent of the area devoted to a close-sown crop may be used in lieu of measuring the acreage of turn areas.</P>

                <P>(b) The farm operator may adjust an acreage of tobacco (except flue-cured and burley) by disposing of such excess tobacco prior to the marketing of any of the same kind of tobacco from the farm. The disposition shall be witnessed by a representative of FSA and may take place before, during, or after the harvesting of the same kind of tobacco grown on the farm. However, no credit will be allowed toward the disposition of excess acreage after the tobacco is harvested but prior to marketing, unless the county committee determines that such tobacco is representative of the entire crop from the farm of the kind of tobacco involved.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Farm constitution.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) In order to implement FSA programs and monitor compliance with regulations, FSA must have records on what land is being farmed by a particular producer. This is accomplished by a determination of what land or group of lands “constitute” an individual unit or farm. Land that was properly constituted under prior regulations will remain so constituted until a reconstitution is required by paragraph (c) of this section. The constitution and identification of land as a “farm” for the first time and the subsequent reconstitution of a farm made thereafter will include all land operated by an individual entity or joint operation as a single farming unit except that it may not include:<PRTPAGE P="44"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Land under separate ownership unless the owners agree in writing or have previously agreed in writing and the labor, equipment, accounting system, and management are operated in common by the operator, but separate from other tracts;</P>
                <P>(2) Land under a lease agreement of less than 1 year duration;</P>
                <P>(3) Federally owned land unless it is rangeland on which no crops are planted and on which there are no crop base acres established;</P>
                <P>(4) State-owned wildlife lands unless the former owner has possession of the land under a leasing agreement;</P>
                <P>(5) Land constituting a farm that is declared ineligible to be enrolled in a program under the regulations governing the program;</P>
                <P>(6) For base acre crops, land located in counties that are not contiguous except where:</P>
                <P>(i) Counties are divided by a river;</P>
                <P>(ii) Counties do not share a common border because of a correction line adjustment; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The land is within 20 miles, by road, of other land that will be a part of the farming unit;</P>
                <P>(7) Land subject to either a default election or a valid election made under part 1412 of this title for each and all covered commodities constituted with land that has a different default election or valid election for each and all covered commodities, irrespective of whether or not any of the land has base acres; or</P>
                <P>(8) Land subject to an election of individual coverage under the Agriculture Risk Coverage Program (ARC-IC) in any State constituted with any land in another State.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) If all land on the farm is physically located in one county, the farm shall be administratively located in such county. If there is no FSA office in the county or the county offices have been consolidated, the farm shall be administratively located in the contiguous county most convenient for the farm operator.</P>
                <P>(2) If the land on the farm is located in more than one county, the farm shall be administratively located in either of such counties as the county committees and the farm operator agree. If no agreement can be reached, the farm shall be administratively located in the county where the principal dwelling is situated, or where the major portion of the farm is located if there is no dwelling.</P>
                <P>(c) A reconstitution of a farm either by division or by combination is required whenever:</P>
                <P>(1) A change has occurred in the operation of the land since the last constitution or reconstitution and as a result of such change the farm does not meet the conditions for constitution of a farm as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, except that no reconstitution will be made if the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the change in operation is to establish eligibility to transfer allotments subject to sale or lease, or increase the amount of program benefits received;</P>
                <P>(2) The farm was not properly constituted the previous time;</P>
                <P>(3) An owner requests in writing that the land no longer be included in a farm composed of tracts under separate ownership;</P>
                <P>(4) The county committee determines that the farm was reconstituted on the basis of false information;</P>
                <P>(5) The county committee determines that tracts included in a farm are not being operated as a single farming unit.</P>
                <P>(d) An owner can file a written request to have FSA reconstitute from original tracts areas that are less than 10 DCP cropland acres and less than 5 percent of the original tract, if such request is accompanied by sufficient data from which FSA can determine the political county and State of land in both the original tract and the proposed tract. Any owner-initiated requests for tract divisions for physical location will be performed and effective prospectively from date of request and approval by FSA.</P>
                <P>(e) Reconstitution shall not be approved if the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the reconstitution is to:</P>

                <P>(a) The methods for dividing farms, tracts, and base acres are, in order of precedence: Estate, designation by landowner, cropland, and default. The proper method will be determined on a crop-by-crop basis.</P>
                <P>(b) The estate method for reconstitution is the pro-rata distribution of base acres for a parent farm among the heirs in settling an estate. If the estate sells a tract of land before the farm is divided among the heirs, the base acres for that tract will be determined according to paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Base acres must be divided in accordance with a will, but only if the county committee determines that the terms of the will are such that a division can reasonably be made by the estate method.</P>
                <P>(2) If there is no will or the county committee determines that the terms of a will are not clear as to the division of base acres, the base acres will be apportioned in the manner agreed to in writing by all interested heirs or devisees who acquire an interest in the property for which base acres have been established. An agreement by the administrator or executor will not be accepted in lieu of an agreement by the heirs or devisees.</P>
                <P>(3) If base acres are not apportioned as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the base acres must be divided as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable.</P>

                <P>(c) If the ownership of a tract of land is transferred from a parent farm, the transferring owner may request that the county committee divide the base acres, including historical acreage that has been double cropped, between the parent farm and the transferred tract, or between the various tracts if the entire farm is sold to two or more purchasers.<PRTPAGE P="47"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) If the county committee determines that base acres cannot be divided in the manner designated by the owner because the owner's designation does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, FSA will notify the owner and permit the owner to revise the designation to meet the requirements. If the owner does not furnish a revised designation of base acres within a reasonable time after such notification, or if the revised designation does not meet the requirements, the county committee will divide the base acres in a pro-rata manner in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The landowner may designate a manner in which base acres are divided by filing a signed written memorandum of understanding of the designation of base acres with the county committee before the transfer of ownership of the land. Both the transferring owner and transferee must sign the written designation of base acres.</P>
                <P>(i) Within 30 days after a prescribed form, letter, or notice of base acres is issued by FSA following the reconstitution of a farm but before any subsequent transfer of ownership of the land, all owners in existence at time of the reconstitution request may seek a different manner of base acre designation by agreeing in writing by executing a form CCC-517 or other designated form.</P>
                <P>(ii) The landowner must designate the base acres that will be permanently reduced when the sum of the base acres exceeds the effective cropland plus double-cropped acres for the farm.</P>
                <P>(iii) When the part of the farm from which the ownership is being transferred was owned for less than 3 years, the designation by landowner method of designating base acres cannot be used unless the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the ownership transfer was other than to retain or to sell base acres. In the absence of such a determination, and if the farm contains land that has been owned for less than 3 years, the part of the farm that has been owned for less than 3 years will be considered as a separate farm and the base acres must be assigned to that farm in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. Such apportionment will be made prior to any designation of base acres with respect to the part that has been owned for 3 years or more.</P>
                <P>(3) The designation by landowner method may be applied, at the owner's request, to land owned by an Indian Tribal Council that is leased to two or more producers for the production of any crop of a commodity for which base acres have been established. If the land is leased to two or more producers, an Indian Tribal Council may request that the county committee divide the base acres between the applicable tracts in the manner designated by the Council. The use of this method is not subject to the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) The cropland method for reconstitution is the pro-rata distribution of base acres to the resulting tracts in the same proportion that each resulting tract bears to the cropland for the parent tract. This method of division will be used if paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply.</P>
                <P>(e) The default method for reconstitution is the separation of tracts from a farm with each tract maintaining the base acres attributed to the tract when the reconstitution is initiated.</P>
                <P>(f) Farm program payment yields calculated for the resulting farms of a division may be increased or decreased if the county committee determines the method used did not provide an equitable distribution considering available land, cultural operations, and changes in the type of farming conducted on the farm. Any increase in the farm program payment yield on a resulting farm will be offset by a corresponding decrease on another resulting farm of the division.</P>

                <P>(a) When two or more farms or tracts are combined for a year, that year's base acres, with respect to the combined farm or tract, as required by applicable program regulations, will not be greater than the sum of the base acres for each of the farms or tracts <PRTPAGE P="48"/>comprising the combination, subject to the provisions of § 718.204.</P>

                <P>(1) The program matter with respect to which the relief is sought is a program matter in a covered program <PRTPAGE P="50"/>which is operated within the State under the control of the SED;</P>
                <P>(2) The total amount of relief which will be provided to the participant (that is, to the individual or entity that applies for the relief) by that SED under this special authority for errors during that year is less than $20,000 (including in that calculation, any loan amount or other benefit of any kind payable for that year and any other year);</P>
                <P>(3) The total amount of such relief which has been previously provided to the participant using this special authority for errors, as calculated above, is not more than $5,000;</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Report of the exercise of the power.</E> A grant of relief shall be considered to be under this section and subject to the special finality provided in this section only if the SED grants the relief in writing when granting the relief to the party who will receive the benefit of such relief and only if, in that document, the SED declares that they are exercising that power. The SED must report the exercise of that power to the Deputy Administrator so that a full accounting may be made in keeping with the limitations of this section. Absent such a report, relief will not be considered to have been made under this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional limits on the authority.</E> The authority provided under this section does not extend to:</P>

                <P>(1) The administration of payment limitations under part 1400 of this chapter (§§ 1001 to 1001F of 7 U.S.C. 1308 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
                <P>(2) The administration of payment limitations under a conservation program administered by the Secretary; or</P>

                <P>(3) Highly erodible land and wetland conservation requirements under subtitles B or C of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3811 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) as administered under 7 CFR part 12.</P>
                <P>(d) Relief may not be provided by the SED under this section until a written opinion or written acknowledgment is obtained from OGC that grounds exist for determination that requirements for granting relief under § 718.303 or § 718.304 have been met, that the form of relief is authorized under § 718.305, and that the granting of the relief is within the lawful authority of the SED.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Relation to other authorities.</E> The authority provided under this section is in addition to any other applicable authority that may allow relief.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Time and method of application.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) To be eligible for payment, producers must obtain and submit a completed application for payment and meet other eligibility requirements specified in this part. Producers may obtain an application in person, by mail, or by facsimile from any county FSA office. In addition, producers may download a copy of the application at <E T="03">http://www.sc.egov.usda.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) An application for payment must be submitted on a completed application form. Applications and any other supporting documentation must be submitted to the FSA county office serving the county where the agricultural operation is located, but, in any case, must be received by the FSA county office by the close of business on the last day of the application period established by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) All producers who incurred transportation costs for eligible reimbursements and who share in the risk of an agricultural operation must certify to the information on the application before the application will be considered complete. FSA may require the producer to provide documentation to support all verifiable records.</P>
              <P>(d) Each producer requesting payment under this part must certify to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in their application and any supporting documentation. All information provided is subject to verification by FSA. Refusal to allow FSA or any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a denial of eligibility. Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without it program benefits will not be approved. Providing a false certification to the Federal Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines and other penalties or sanctions.</P>
              <P>(e) To ensure all producers are provided an opportunity to submit actual costs for reimbursement at the actual cost rate, applicants will have 30 days after the end of the FY to provide supporting documentation of actual transportation costs to the FSA County Office. The actual costs documented in supporting documentation will override previously reported costs of eligible reimbursable costs at the fixed or set rate made during the application period.</P>
              <P>(f) If verifiable records are not provided to FSA, the producer will be ineligible for payment.</P>
              <P>(g) If supporting documentation is provided within 30 days after the end of the FY, but an application was not submitted to the applicable FSA County Office before the end of the application period, the producer is not eligible for payment.</P>
              <P>(h) Producers who submit applications after the application period are not entitled to any payment consideration or determination of eligibility. Regardless of the reason why an application is not submitted to or received by FSA, any application received after the close of business on such date will not be eligible for benefits under this program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To be eligible to receive payments under this part, a geographically disadvantaged farmer or rancher must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be a producer of an eligible agricultural commodity in substantial commercial quantities;</P>
              <P>(2) Incur transportation costs for the transportation of the agricultural commodity or input used to produce the agricultural commodity;</P>
              <P>(3) Submit an accurate and complete application for payment as specified in § 755.3; and</P>

              <P>(4) Be in compliance with the wetland and highly erodible conservation requirements in part 12 of this title and meet the adjusted gross income and <PRTPAGE P="54"/>pay limit eligibility requirements in part 1400 of this title, as applicable, except that the $8,000 cap provided for in this rule is a per producer cap, not a per person cap. For example, a partnership of four individuals would be considered one producer, not four persons, for the purposes of this cap and thus the partnership could only generate a single $8,000 payment under this program if the cap holds because of full subscription of the program.</P>
              <P>(b) Individual producers in an agricultural operation that is an entity are only eligible for a payment based on their share of the operation. A producer is not eligible for payment based on the share of production of any other producer.</P>
              <P>(c) Multiple producers, such as the buyer and seller of a commodity (for example, a producer of hay and a livestock operation that buys the hay), are not eligible for payments for the same eligible transportation cost. Unless the multiple producers agree otherwise, only the last buyer will be eligible for the payment.</P>
              <P>(d) A person or entity determined to be a “foreign person” under part 1400 of this title is not eligible to receive benefits under this part, unless that person provides land, capital, and a substantial amount of active personal labor in the production of crops on such farm.</P>
              <P>(e) State and local governments and their political subdivisions and related agencies are not eligible for RTCP payments.</P>

              <P>(6) Retail sales receipts with verifiable records handwritten as applicable.</P>
              <P>(d) To be eligible for reimbursement based on actual costs, the producer must provide supporting documentation that documents the specific costs incurred for transportation of each commodity or input. Such documentation must:</P>
              <P>(1) Show transportation costs for each specific commodity or input, and</P>
              <P>(2) Show the units of measure for each commodity or input, such that FSA can determine the transportation cost per unit.</P>

              <P>(a) Payments may be based on fixed, set, or actual transportation rates. Fixed and set transportation rates will be established by FSA, based on available data for transportation costs for that commodity or input in the applicable State or insular region.</P>
              <P>(b) Fixed transportation rates will establish per unit transportation costs for each eligible commodity or input used to produce the eligible commodity.</P>
              <P>(c) Set transportation rates will be established for those transportation costs that are not on the FSA list of fixed rates and for which an actual rate cannot be documented. The set transportation rate will be set by FSA, based on available data of transportation costs for similar commodities and inputs.</P>
              <P>(d) Actual transportation rates will be determined based on supporting documentation.</P>

              <P>(d) The total payment amount for a producer is the sum of all eligible reimbursable amounts determined in paragraph (b) of this section for all commodities and inputs used to produce the eligible commodities listed on the application.</P>
              <P>(e) Payment amounts are subject to $8,000 cap per FY per producer as defined in this part, not per “person” or “legal entity” as those terms might be defined in part 1400 of this title.</P>

              <P>(a) This part specifies the types of incidents that can result in an area being determined a disaster area, which under other regulations makes qualified farmers in such areas eligible for Emergency loans (EM) or eligible for such other assistance that may be available, based on Secretarial disaster designations. Nothing in this part overrides provision of those regulations that govern the actual administration and availability of the disaster assistance regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) This part specifies the responsibility of the County Emergency Board (CEB), State Emergency Board (SEB), and the State Executive Director (SED) in regard to Secretarial Designations with regards to disasters. It also addresses matters relating to the handling of a Presidential declaration of disaster or the imposition of a USDA quarantine by the Secretary with respect to triggering the availability of EM loans.</P>

                <E T="03">Contiguous county</E> is used in reference to a primary county as defined in this section. A contiguous county is any county whose boundary touches at any point with that of the primary county. For programs other than the EM Program, disaster assistance regulations will specify whether benefits will be available only in the primary counties or also in the contiguous counties. For the EM Program that issue is addressed in § 759.6, unless specified otherwise in the disaster assistance regulations for other programs or in § 759.6 for the EM Program, only the “primary” county will be considered the qualifying “disaster county.” Therefore, if the disaster assistance regulations specify that they cover the disaster area and contiguous counties, then the only eligible counties would be the primary county and those contiguous to that county. Coverage would not include coverage of those counties that are in turn contiguous to those counties that are contiguous to the primary county.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">County</E> is used when referring to a geographical area, a local administrative subdivision of a State or a similar political subdivision of the United States generally considered to be in county usage, for example, it includes an area referred to as a “county” or “parish.” Except where otherwise specified, the use of the term county or similar political subdivision is for administrative purposes only.</P>

                <E T="03">Disaster area</E> is the county or counties declared or designated as a disaster area as a result of natural disaster related losses. The disaster area only includes the primary counties, but <PRTPAGE P="58"/>benefits may be available in the counties contiguous to the primary county if so provided by the disaster assistance regulations or, in the case of the EM Program, in § 759.6.</P>

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121-2) requiring Federal emergency assistance to supplement State and local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Production losses (severe)</E> within a county are those in which there has been a reduction county-wide of at least a 30 percent or more loss of production of at least one crop in the county.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">U.S. Drought Monitor</E> is a system for classifying drought severity according to a range of abnormally dry to exceptional drought. It is a collaborative effort between Federal and academic partners that is produced on a weekly basis to synthesize multiple indices, outlooks, and drought impacts on a map and in narrative form. This synthesis of indices is reported by the National Drought Mitigation Center.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">United States</E> means each of the several States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

              <SUBJECT>Secretarial disaster area determination and notification process.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">U.S. Drought Monitor.</E> With respect to drought and without requiring an LAR:</P>

              <P>(1) If any portion of a county is physically located in an area with a Drought Monitor Intensity Classification value of D3 (drought-extreme) or higher during any part of the growing season of the crops affected by the disaster in the county, then the county will be designated a disaster area by the Secretary.<PRTPAGE P="59"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If any portion of a county meets the threshold Drought Monitor Intensity Classification value of D2 (drought-severe) for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the growing season of affected crops, then the county will be designated a disaster area by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">CEB and SEB recommendations.</E> In instances where counties have been impacted by a disaster but the county has not been designated a disaster area under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, CEB will make a disaster designation recommendation request to SEB when a disaster has resulted in severe production losses. The determination of the sufficiency of the production losses will be governed by the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section. The CEB may make such efforts as are needed to identify counties that have been impacted and had such production losses. A farmer, Indian Tribal Council, or local governing body may initiate the process by reporting production losses or drought conditions to CEB and suggesting that there be a recommendation in favor of designating a county as a disaster area. Recommendations by a CEB in favor of a disaster designation by a CEB under this paragraph are subject to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A LAR is required as part of a CEB disaster designation request. CEB will submit a disaster designation request with a LAR to SEB for review and recommendation for approval by the Secretary. CEB's written request and SEB recommendation must be submitted within three months of the last day of the occurrence of a natural disaster.</P>
              <P>(2) If SEB determines a qualifying natural disaster and loss have occurred, SEB will forward the recommendation to the Administrator. The natural disaster may include drought conditions that were not sufficiently severe to meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. Since the U.S. Drought Monitor tracks only drought conditions, not specifically agricultural losses resulting from those conditions, it is possible for a drought that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to result in production losses that constitute a natural disaster.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary or the Secretary's designee will make disaster area determinations. The Secretary may delegate the authority to the SED. In such case, the SED will act on behalf of the Secretary, subject to review by DAFP as may be appropriate and consistent with the delegation. The delegation of authority to the SED may be revoked by the authority making that delegation or by other authorized person. In all cases, DAFP may reverse any SED determination made in accordance with this section unless the delegation to the SED specifies that such review is not allowed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible production losses.</E> For purposes of making determinations under paragraph (b) of this section, in order for an area to be declared a disaster area under paragraph (b) of this section based on production losses, the county must have had production losses of 30 percent of at least one crop in the county as the result of a natural disaster.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Discretionary exception to production losses for designating a county as a disaster county.</E> For purposes of the EM program only, unless otherwise specified in the designation, a county may be designated by DAFP as a designated disaster county even though the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are not present so long as the disaster has otherwise produced such significant production losses, or other such extenuating circumstances so as to justify, in the opinion of the Secretary, the designation of a county as a disaster area. In making this determination, the Secretary may consider all relevant factors including such factors as the nature and extent of production losses; the number of farmers who have sustained qualifying production losses; the number of farmers that other lenders in the county indicate they will not be in position to provide emergency financing; whether the losses will cause undue hardship to a certain segment of farmers in the county; whether damage to particular crops has resulted in undue hardship; whether other Federal or State benefit programs, which are being made available due to the same <PRTPAGE P="60"/>disaster, will consequently lessen undue hardship and the demand for EM; and any other factors considered relevant.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 759.6</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>EM to be made available.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of the EM Program under part 764, subpart I, of this chapter, a county will be considered an eligible disaster area as designated by FSA for coverage of the EM Program as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Secretarial designations.</E> When production losses meet the requirements in § 759.5 and the county has been designated as a disaster area for that reason, or when the discretionary exception to production losses for EM under § 759.5(d) has been exercised, the primary and contiguous counties will be areas in which otherwise eligible producers can receive EM loans.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Physical loss notification.</E> When only qualifying physical losses occur, the SED will submit a request to the FSA Administrator to make a determination that a natural disaster has occurred in a county, resulting in severe physical losses. If the FSA Administrator determines that such a natural disaster has occurred, then EM can be made available to eligible farmers for physical losses only in the primary county (the county that was the subject of that determination) and the counties contiguous to that county.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">USDA quarantine.</E> Any quarantine imposed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Plant Protection Act or the animal quarantine laws, as defined in section 2509 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, automatically authorizes EM for production and physical losses resulting from the quarantine in a primary county (the county in which the quarantine was in force) and (where the quarantine effects extend beyond that county) the counties contiguous to that primary county.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Presidential declaration.</E> Whenever the President declares a Major Disaster Declaration or an Emergency Declaration, FSA will make EM available to eligible applicants in declared and contiguous counties, provided:</P>
              <P>(i) The Presidential declaration is not solely for Category A or Category B Public Assistance or Hazard Mitigation Grant Assistance, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Presidential Major Disaster declaration is for losses due to severe, general disaster conditions including but not limited to conditions such as flood, hurricane, or earthquake.</P>

                  <P>(a) No indemnity payment shall be made for contaminated milk resulting from residues of chemicals or toxic substances if, within 30 days after receiving a complete application, the Deputy Administrator determines that other legal recouse is available to the farmer. An application shall not be deemed complete unless it contains all information necessary to make a determination as to whether other legal recourse is available to the farmer. However, notwithstanding such a determination, the Deputy Administrator may reopen the case at a later date and make a new determination on the merits of the case as may be just and equitable.</P>

                  <P>(b) In the event that a farmer receives an indemnity payment under this subpart, and such farmer is later compensated for the same loss by the person (or the representative or successor in interest of such person) responsible for such loss, the indemnity payment shall be refunded by the farmer to the Department of Agriculture: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the amount of such refund shall not exceed the amount of other compensation received by the farmer.</P>
                  <P>(c) The period eligible for DIPP benefits for the same loss may not extend past the time period that the impacted dairy cows in the dairy herd are no longer lactating or impacted dairy cows in gestation have delivered a calf and are no longer lactating from its most immediately preceding birth after the contaminating event, not to exceed 18 months. Claims for milk from the affected farmer not reinstated to the commercial markets after the impacted dairy cows in the herd are dry and no longer producing milk from its most immediately preceding birth after the contaminating event, or have exceeded the 18-month period will not be compensated any further. Dairy producers that have exceeded the specified period established by FSA before June 18, 2018 will be allowed to submit one additional claim. Dairy cows purchased or bred after the occurrence of the contaminating event may not be included in the claim for benefits.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Administration of ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The programs in subparts C through H of this part will be administered under the general supervision and direction of the Administrator, Farm Service Agency (FSA), and the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA (who is referred to as the “Deputy Administrator” in this part).</P>
                <P>(b) FSA representatives do not have authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations of this part as amended or supplemented, except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) The State FSA committee will take any action required by the regulations of this part that the county FSA committee has not taken. The State FSA committee will also:</P>
                <P>(1) Correct, or require a county FSA committee to correct, any action taken by such county FSA committee that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part or</P>

                <P>(d) No provision or delegation to a State or county FSA committee will preclude the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, or a designee or other such person, from determining any question arising under the programs of this part, or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county FSA committee.</P>

                <P>(e) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs may authorize State and county FSA committees to waive <PRTPAGE P="71"/>or modify non-statutory deadlines, or other program requirements of this part in cases where lateness or failure to meet such requirements does not adversely affect operation of the programs in this part. Participants have no right to seek an exception under this provision. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to consider cases or circumstances or decision not to exercise this discretionary authority under this provision will not be considered an adverse decision and is not appealable.</P>

                <P>(1) Citizen of the United States;</P>
                <P>(2) Resident alien; for purposes of this part, resident alien means “lawful alien” as defined in 7 CFR part 1400;</P>

                <P>(a) To be eligible for program payments under:</P>
                <P>(1) ELAP, SURE, and TAP, eligible producers for any commodity at any location for which the producer seeks benefits must have for every commodity on every farm in which the producer has an interest for the relevant program year:</P>
                <P>(i) In the case of an “insurable commodity,” (which for this part means a commodity for which the Deputy Administrator determines catastrophic coverage is available from the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA)) obtained catastrophic coverage or better under a policy or plan of insurance administered by RMA under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (FCIA) (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), except that this obligation will not include crop insurance pilot programs so designated by RMA or to forage crops intended for grazing, and</P>
                <P>(ii) In the case of a “noninsurable commodity,” (which is any commodity for which, as to the particular production in question, is not an “insurable commodity,” but for which coverage is available under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) operated under 7 CFR part 1437), have obtained NAP coverage by filing the proper paperwork and fee within the relevant deadlines, except that this requirement will not include forage on grazing land.</P>
                <P>(2) LFP, with respect to those grazing lands incurring losses for which assistance is being requested, eligible livestock producers must have:</P>
                <P>(i) Obtained a policy or plan of insurance for the forage crop under FCIA, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Filed the required paperwork and paid the administrative fee by the applicable State filing deadline for NAP coverage for that grazing land.</P>
                <P>(b) Producers who did not purchase a policy or plan of insurance administered by RMA in accordance with FCIA (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), or NAP coverage for their applicable crops, will not be eligible for assistance under ELAP, LFP, SURE, and TAP, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section unless the producer is one of the classes of farmers for which an exemption under § 760.107 apply, is exempt under the “buy-in” provisions of this subpart, or is granted relief from that requirement by the Deputy Administrator under some other provision of this part.</P>

                <P>(c) Producers who have obtained insurance by a written agreement as specified in § 400.652(d) of this title even though that production would not normally be considered an “insurable commodity” under the rules of this subpart, will be considered to have met the risk management purchase requirement of this subpart with respect to such production. The commodity to which the agreement applies will be considered for purposes of this subpart to be an “insurable commodity.”<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Producers by an administrative process who were granted NAP coverage for the relevant period as a form of relief in an administrative proceeding, or who were awarded NAP coverage for the relevant period through an appeal through the National Appeals Division (NAD), will be considered as having met the NAP eligibility criteria of this section for that crop as long as the applicable NAP service fee has been paid.</P>
                <P>(e) The risk management purchase requirement for programs specified under this part will be determined based on the initial intended use of a crop at the time a policy or plan of insurance or NAP coverage was purchased and as reported on the acreage report.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Waiver for certain crop years; buy-in.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For the 2008 crop year, the insurance or NAP purchase requirements of § 760.104 (this is referred to as the “purchase” requirement) will be waived for eligible producers for losses during the 2008 crop year if the eligible producer paid a fee (buy-in fee) equal to the applicable NAP service fee or catastrophic risk protection plan fee to the Secretary by September 16, 2008. Payment of a buy-in fee under this section is for the sole purpose of becoming eligible for participation in ELAP, LFP, SURE, and TAP. Payment of a buy-in fee does not provide any actual insurance or NAP coverage or assistance.</P>
                <P>(b) For the 2009 crop year, the purchase requirement will be waived for purchases where the closing date for coverage occurred prior to August 14, 2008, so long as the buy-in fee set by the Secretary of Agriculture was paid by January 12, 2009.</P>
                <P>(c) Any producer of 2008 commodities who is otherwise ineligible because of the purchase requirement and who did not meet the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section may still be covered for ELAP, SURE, or TAP assistance if the producer paid the applicable fee described in paragraph (d) of this section no later than May 18, 2009, provided that in the case of each:</P>
                <P>(1) Insurable commodity, excluding grazing land, the eligible producers on the farm agree to obtain a policy or plan of insurance under FCIA (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), excluding a crop insurance pilot program under that subtitle, for the next insurance year for which crop insurance is available to the eligible producers on the farm at a level of coverage equal to 70 percent or more of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage, and</P>
                <P>(2) Noninsurable commodity, the eligible producers on the farm must agree to file the required paperwork, and pay the administrative fee by the applicable State filing deadline, for NAP for the next year for which a policy is available.</P>
                <P>(d) For producers seeking eligibility under paragraph (c) of this section, the applicable buy-in fee for the 2008 crop year was the catastrophic risk protection plan fee or the applicable NAP service fee in effect prior to NAP service fee adjustments specified in the 2008 Farm Bill.</P>

                <P>(a) The Secretary may provide equitable relief on a case-by-case basis for the purchase requirement to eligible participants that:</P>
                <P>(1) Are otherwise ineligible or provide evidence, satisfactory to FSA, that the failure to meet the requirements of § 760.104 for one or more eligible crops on the farm was unintentional and not because of any fault of the participant, as determined by the Secretary, or</P>
                <P>(2) Failed to meet the requirements of § 760.104 due to the enactment of the 2008 Farm Bill after the:</P>
                <P>(i) Applicable sales closing date for a policy or plan of insurance in accordance with the FCIA (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) or</P>
                <P>(ii) Application closing date for NAP.</P>
                <P>(b) Equitable relief will not be granted to participants in instances of:</P>

                <P>(1) A scheme or device that had the effect or intent of defeating the purposes of a program of insurance, NAP, or any other program administered under this part or elsewhere in this title,<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) An intentional decision to not meet the purchase or buy-in requirements,</P>
                <P>(3) Producers against whom sanctions have been imposed by RMA or FSA prohibiting the purchase of coverage or prohibiting the receipt of payments otherwise payable under this part,</P>
                <P>(4) Violations of highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12,</P>
                <P>(5) Producers who are ineligible under any provisions of law, including regulations, relating to controlled substances (see for example 7 CFR 718.6), or</P>
                <P>(6) A producer's debarment by a federal agency from receiving any federal government payment if such debarment included payments of the type involved in this matter.</P>
                <P>(c) In general, no relief that is discretionary will be allowed except upon a finding by the Deputy Administrator or the Deputy Administrator's designee that the person seeking the relief acted in good faith as determined in accordance with such rules and procedures as may be set by the Deputy Administrator.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Socially disadvantaged, limited resource, or beginning farmer or rancher.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Risk management purchase requirements, as provided in § 760.104, will be waived for a participant who, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, is eligible to be considered a “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher,” a “limited resource farmer or rancher,” or a “beginning farmer or rancher.”</P>
                <P>(b) To qualify for this section as a “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher,” “limited resource farmer or rancher,” or “beginning farmer or rancher,” participants must meet eligibility criteria as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) A “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” is, for this section, a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group whose members have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities. Gender is not included as a covered group. Socially disadvantaged groups include the following and no others unless approved in writing by the Deputy Administrator:</P>
                <P>(i) American Indians or Alaskan Natives,</P>
                <P>(ii) Asians or Asian-Americans,</P>
                <P>(iii) Blacks or African Americans,</P>
                <P>(iv) Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, and</P>
                <P>(v) Hispanics.</P>
                <P>(2) A “limited resource farmer or rancher” means for this section a producer who is both:</P>
                <P>(i) A producer whose direct or indirect gross farm sales do not exceed $100,000 in both of the two calendar years that precede the calendar year that corresponds to the relevant program year, adjusted upwards for any general inflation since fiscal year 2004, inflation as measured using the Prices Paid by Farmer Index compiled by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and</P>

                <P>(ii) A producer whose total household income is at or below the national poverty level for a family of four, or less than 50 percent of the county median household income for the same two calendar years referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, as determined annually using Commerce Department data. (Limited resource farmer or rancher status can be determined using a Web site available through the Limited Resource Farmer and Rancher Online Self Determination Tool through the National Resource and Conservation Service at <E T="03">http://www.lrftool.sc.egov.usda.gov/tool.asp.</E>)</P>
                <P>(3) A “beginning farmer or rancher” means for this section a person or legal entity who for a program year both:</P>
                <P>(i) Has never previously operated a farm or ranch, or who has not operated a farm or ranch in the previous 10 years, applicable to all members (shareholders, partners, beneficiaries, etc., as fits the circumstances) of an entity, and</P>
                <P>(ii) Will have or has had for the relevant period materially and substantially participated in the operation of a farm or ranch.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment limitation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For 2008, no person, as defined and determined under the provisions in part 1400 of this title in effect for 2008 may receive more than:</P>
                <P>(1) $100,000 total for the 2008 program year under ELAP, LFP, LIP, and SURE combined or</P>
                <P>(2) $100,000 for the 2008 program year under TAP.</P>
                <P>(b) For 2009 and subsequent program years, no person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined by the rules in part 1400 of this title may receive, directly or indirectly, more than:</P>
                <P>(1) $100,000 per program year total under ELAP, LFP, LIP, and SURE combined; or</P>
                <P>(2) $100,000 per program year under TAP.</P>
                <P>(c) The Deputy Administrator may take such actions as needed, whether or not specifically provided for, to avoid a duplication of benefits under the multiple programs provided for in this part, or duplication of benefits received in other programs, and may impose such cross-program payment limitations as may be consistent with the intent of this part.</P>
                <P>(1) FSA will review ELAP payments after the funding factor as specified in § 760.208 is determined to be 100 percent. FSA will ensure that total ELAP payments provided to a participant in a year, together with any amount provided to the same participant for the same loss as a result of any Federal crop insurance program, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, or any other Federal disaster program, plus the value of the commodity that was not lost, is not more than 95 percent of the value of the commodity in the absence of the loss, as estimated by FSA.</P>
                <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(d) In applying the limitation on average adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2008, an individual or entity is ineligible for payment under ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP if the individual's or entity's average adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds $2.5 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005 under the provisions in part 1400 of this title in effect for 2008.</P>
                <P>(e) For 2009 through 2011, the average AGI limitation provisions in part 1400 of this title relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, with certain levels of average adjusted gross income (AGI) will apply under this subpart and will apply to each applicant for ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP. Specifically, for 2009 through 2011, a person or legal entity with an average adjusted gross nonfarm income, as defined in § 1404.3 of this title, that exceeds $500,000 will not be eligible to receive benefits under this part.</P>

                <P>(f) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this title apply to ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP for 2009 and subsequent years. Under those rules, any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a participant to directly receive a payment under this part, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest. For all purposes under this section, unless otherwise specified in part 1400 of this title, the AGI figure that will be relevant for a person or legal entity will be an average AGI for the three <PRTPAGE P="75"/>taxable years that precede the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by CCC.</P>

Interest will run from the date of the original disbursement by FSA.</P>
                <P>(b) A participant will refund to FSA all program payments, plus interest, as determined in accordance with part 792 of this chapter, provided however, that in any case it will run from the date of the original disbursement, received by such participant with respect to all contracts or applications, as may be applicable, if the participant is determined to have knowingly done any of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program,</P>
                <P>(2) Made any fraudulent representation, or</P>

                <P>By law, “up to” $50 million per year for the years in question may be approved for use by the Secretary and accordingly, within that cap, the only funds that will be considered available to pay claims will be that amount approved by the Secretary.

Payments will not be made for claims arising out of a particular year until, for all claims for that year, the time for applying for a payment has passed. <PRTPAGE P="86"/>In the event that, within the limits of the funding made available by the Secretary within the statutory cap, approval of eligible applications would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will prorate the available funds by a national factor to reduce the total expected payments to the amount made available by the Secretary. FSA will make payments based on the factor for the national rate determined by FSA. FSA will prorate the payments in such manner as it determines appropriate and reasonable. Claims that are unpaid or prorated for a calendar year for any reason will not be carried forward for payment under other funds for later years or otherwise, but will be considered, as to any unpaid amount, void and nonpayable.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment calculation.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) An eligible livestock producer will be eligible to receive payments for grazing losses for qualifying drought as specified in § 760.305(a) equal to one, two, or three times the monthly payment rate specified in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section. Total LFP payments <PRTPAGE P="93"/>to an eligible livestock producer in a calendar year for grazing losses due to qualifying drought will not exceed three monthly payments for the same livestock. Payments calculated in this section or elsewhere with respect to LFP are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part and are also subject to the payment limitations and average adjusted gross income provisions that are contained in subpart B. Payment may only be made to the extent that eligibility is specifically provided for in this subpart. Hence, with respect to drought, payments will be made only as a “one month” payment, a “two month” payment, or a “three month” payment based on the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) To be eligible to receive a one month payment, that is a payment equal to the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (g) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D2 severe drought (intensity) in any area of the county for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland in the county.</P>
                <P>(c) To be eligible to receive a two month payment, that is a payment equal to twice the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (g) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D3 (extreme drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.</P>
                <P>(d) To be eligible to receive a three month payment, that is a payment equal to three times the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (g) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D3 (extreme drought) intensity in any area of the county for at least 4 weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, or is rated as having a D4 (exceptional drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.</P>
                <P>(e) The monthly payment rate for LFP for grazing losses due to a qualifying drought, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, will be equal to 60 percent of the lesser of:</P>
                <P>(1) The monthly feed cost for all covered livestock owned or leased by the eligible livestock producer, as determined in paragraph (g) of this section or</P>
                <P>(2) The monthly feed cost calculated by using the normal carrying capacity of the eligible grazing land of the eligible livestock producer, as determined in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) In the case of an eligible livestock producer that sold or otherwise disposed of covered livestock due to a qualifying drought in 1 or both of the 2 production years immediately preceding the current production year, the payment rate is 80 percent of the monthly payment rate calculated in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(g) The monthly feed cost for covered livestock equals the product obtained by multiplying:</P>
                <P>(1) 30 days;</P>
                <P>(2) A payment quantity equal to the amount referred to in paragraph (h) of this section as the “feed grain equivalent”, as determined under paragraph (h) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(3) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(h) The feed grain equivalent equals, in the case of:</P>
                <P>(1) An adult beef cow, 15.7 pounds of corn per day or</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of any other type or weight of covered livestock, an amount determined by the Secretary that represents the average number of pounds of corn per day necessary to feed that specific type of livestock.</P>
                <P>(i) The corn price per pound equals the quotient obtained by dividing:</P>
                <P>(1) The higher of:<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The national average corn price per bushel for the 12-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the calendar year for which LFP payment is calculated or</P>
                <P>(ii) The national average corn price per bushel for the 24-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the calendar year for which LFP payment is calculated</P>
                <P>(2) By 56.</P>
                <P>(j) The monthly feed cost using the normal carrying capacity of the eligible grazing land equals the product obtained by multiplying:</P>
                <P>(1) 30 days;</P>
                <P>(2) A payment quantity equal to the feed grain equivalent of 15.7 pounds of corn per day;</P>
                <P>(3) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (i) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(4) The number of animal units the eligible livestock producer's grazing land or pastureland can sustain during the normal grazing period in the county for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, in the absence of a drought or fire, determined by dividing the:</P>
                <P>(i) Number of eligible grazing land or pastureland acres of the specific type of grazing land or pastureland by</P>
                <P>(ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland as determined under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(k) An eligible livestock producer will be eligible to receive payments for grazing losses due to a fire as specified in § 760.305(c):</P>
                <P>(1) For the period, subject to paragraph (l)(2) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) Beginning on the date on which the Federal Agency prohibits the eligible livestock producer from using the managed rangeland for grazing and</P>
                <P>(ii) Ending on the earlier of the last day of the Federal lease of the eligible livestock producer or the day that would make the period a 180 day period and</P>
                <P>(2) For grazing losses that occur on not more than 180 days per calendar year.</P>
                <P>(3) For 50 percent of the monthly feed cost, as determined under § 760.308(g), pro-rated to a daily rate, for the total number of livestock covered by the Federal lease of the eligible livestock producer.</P>

                <P>(a) This subpart establishes the terms and conditions under which the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) will be administered under Titles XII and XV of the 2008 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 110-246).</P>
                <P>(b) Eligible livestock owners and contract growers will be compensated in accordance with § 760.406 for eligible livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality that occurred in the calendar year for which benefits are being requested as a direct result of an eligible adverse weather event. An “eligible adverse weather event” is one, as determined by the Secretary, occurring in the program year that could and did, even when normal preventative or corrective measures were taken and good farming practices were followed, directly result in the death of livestock. Because feed can be purchased or otherwise obtained in the event of a drought, drought is not an eligible adverse weather event except when anthrax, resulting from drought, causes the death of eligible livestock.</P>

                <P>(a) Under this subpart, separate payment rates for eligible livestock owners and eligible livestock contract growers are specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Payments for LIP are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock category by the number of eligible livestock in excess of normal mortality in each category that died as a result of an eligible adverse weather event. Normal mortality for each livestock category will be determined by FSA on a State-by-State basis using local data sources including, but not limited to, State livestock organizations and the Cooperative Extension Service for the State. Adjustments will be applied as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The LIP national payment rate for eligible livestock owners is based on 75 percent of the average fair market value of the applicable livestock as computed using nationwide prices for the previous calendar year unless some other price is approved by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(c) The LIP national payment rate for eligible livestock contract growers is based on 75 percent of the average income loss sustained by the contract grower with respect to the dead livestock.</P>
                <P>(d) The LIP payment calculated for eligible livestock contract growers will be reduced by the amount the participant received from the party who contracted with the producer to raise the livestock for the loss of income from the dead livestock.</P>

                <P>(f) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be different from those originally planted. The alternative types will be eligible for payment if the new types have the same general end use, as determined and approved by the county committee. Payments for alternative types will be based on the lesser of rates established to plant the types actually lost or the cost to establish the alternative used. If the type of plantings, seedlings, or cuttings differs significantly from the types lost, the costs may not be approved for payment.</P>
                <P>(g) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be planted on the same farm in a different location than the lost stand. To be eligible for payment, site preparation costs for the new location must not exceed the cost to re-establish the original stand in the original location.</P>
                <P>(h) Eligible orchardists or nursery tree growers may elect not to replant the entire eligible stand. If so, the county committee will calculate payment based on the number of qualifying trees, bushes, or vines actually replanted.</P>
                <P>(i) If a practice, such as site preparation, is needed to both replant and rehabilitate trees, bushes, or vines, the producer must document the expenses attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation. The county committee will determine whether the documentation of expenses detailing the amounts attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation is acceptable. In the event that the county committee determines the documentation does not include acceptable detail of cost allocation, the county committee will pro-rate payment based on physical inspection of the loss, damage, replanting, and rehabilitation.</P>
                <P>(j) The cumulative total quantity of acres planted to trees, bushes, or vines for which a producer may receive payment under this part for losses that occurred between January 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, will not exceed 500 acres.</P>

                <P>(1) All insurable crops on the participant's farm must be covered by crop insurance administered by RMA in accordance with FCIA, and all noninsured crops must be covered under NAP, as specified in § 760.104, unless the participant meets the requirements in either § 760.105 or § 760.107. At the discretion of FSA, the equitable relief provisions in § 760.106 may apply.</P>
                <P>(2) Crop losses must have occurred in crop year 2008 or subsequent crop years due to an eligible disaster event that occurred on or before September 30, 2011.</P>
                <P>(i) For insured crops, the coverage period, as defined in the insurance policy, must have begun on or before September 30, 2011;</P>
                <P>(ii) For NAP crops, the coverage period must have begun on or before September 30, 2011; and</P>

                <P>(3) A qualifying loss as defined in § 760.602 must have occurred.</P>

                <P>(4) The participant must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible <PRTPAGE P="108"/>Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation provisions of part 12 of this title, for 2008 and subsequent crop years through September 30, 2011, as applicable, and must not otherwise be barred from receiving benefits or payments under part 12 of this title or any other law.</P>
                <P>(5) The participant must not be ineligible or otherwise barred from the requisite risk management insurance programs or NAP because of past violations where those insurance programs or NAP would otherwise be available absent such violations.</P>
                <P>(6) The participant must have an entitlement to an ownership share of the crop and also assume production and market risks associated with the production of the crop. In the event the crop was planted but not produced, participants must have an ownership share of the crop that would have been produced.</P>
                <P>(i) Any verbal or written contract that precludes the grower from having an ownership share renders the grower ineligible for payments under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(ii) Growers growing eligible crops under contract are not eligible participants under this subpart unless the grower has an ownership share of the crop.</P>
                <P>(b) In the event that a producer is determined not to be an eligible producer of a crop in accordance with this section, such crop will be disregarded in determining the producer's production or eligibility for payments under this subpart.

Proof of authority to sign for the deceased participant or dissolved entity must be provided. If a participant is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must sign the application for payment. Eligibility of such participant will be determined, as it is for other participants, based upon ownership share and risk in producing the crop.</P>
                <P>(e) Participants receiving payments under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) as specified in subpart C of this part are not eligible to receive payments under SURE for the same loss.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Time and method of application and certification of interests.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Each producer interested in obtaining a SURE payment must file an application for payment and provide an accurate certification of interests. The application will be on a form prescribed by FSA and will require information or certifications from the producer regarding any other assistance, payment, or grant benefit the producer has received for any of the producer's crops or interests on a farm as defined in this subpart; regardless of whether the crop or interest is covered in the farm's SURE guarantee according to § 760.631. The producer's certification of interests will help FSA establish whether the producer is an eligible participant.</P>
                <P>(b) Eligible participants with a qualifying loss as defined in this subpart must submit an application for payment and certification of interests by March 1 of the calendar year that is two years after the relevant corresponding calendar year for the crop year which benefits are sought to be eligible for payment (for example, the final date to submit an application for a SURE payment for the 2009 crop year will be March 1, 2011). Producers who do not submit the application by that date will not be eligible for payment.</P>
                <P>(c) To the extent available and practicable, FSA will assist participants with information regarding their interests in a farm, as of the date of certification, based on information already available to FSA from various sources. However, the participant is solely responsible for providing an accurate certification from which FSA can determine the participant's farm interests for the purposes of this program.

                <P>(4) In the case of an insurable crop for which crop insurance provides for an adjustment in the guarantee liability, or indemnity, such as in the case of prevented planting, that adjustment will be used in determining the guarantee for the insurable crop.</P>
                <P>(5) In the case of a noninsurable crop for which NAP provides for an adjustment in the level of assistance, such as in the case of unharvested crops, that adjustment will be used for determining the guarantee for the noninsurable crop.</P>

                <P>(a) Payment acres as calculated in this section are used in determining both total farm revenue and the SURE guarantee for a farm. Payment acreage will be calculated using the lesser of the reported or determined acres shown to have been planted or prevented from being planted to a crop.</P>
                <P>(b) Initial crop acreage will be the payment acreage for SURE, unless the provisions for subsequent crops in this section are met. Subsequently planted or prevented planted acre acreage is considered acreage for SURE only if the provisions of this section are met. All plantings of an annual or biennial crop are considered the same as a planting of an initial crop in tropical regions as defined in part 1437, subpart F, of this title.</P>
                <P>(c) In cases where there is double cropped acreage, each crop may be included in the acreage for SURE only if the specific crops are either insured crops eligible for double cropping according to RMA or approved by the FSA State committee as eligible double cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(d) Except for insured crops, participants with double cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may have such acreage included in the acreage for SURE on more than one crop only if the participant submits verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful double cropping practice on the specific crops for which payment is requested.</P>
                <P>(e) Participants having multiple plantings may have each planting included in the SURE guarantee only if the planting meets the requirements of part 1437 of this title and all other provisions of this subpart are satisfied.</P>
                <P>(f) Provisions of part 718 of this title specifying what is considered prevented planting and how it must be documented and reported will apply to this payment acreage for SURE.</P>
                <P>(g) Subject to the provisions of this subpart, the FSA county committee will:</P>
                <P>(1) Use the most accurate data available when determining planted and prevented planted acres; and</P>
                <P>(2) Disregard acreage of a crop produced on land that is not eligible for crop insurance or NAP.</P>
                <P>(h) For any crop acreage for which crop insurance or NAP coverage is canceled, those acres will no longer be considered the initial crop and will, therefore, no longer be eligible for SURE.</P>
                <P>(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these or other applicable regulations that relate to tolerance in part 718 of this title, if a farm has a crop that has both FSA and RMA acreage for insured crops, payment acres for the SURE guarantee calculation will be based on acres for which an indemnity was received if RMA acres do not differ from FSA acres by more than the larger of 5 percent or 10 acres not to exceed 50 acres. If the difference between FSA and RMA acres is more than the larger of 5 percent or 10 acres not to exceed 50 acres, then the payment acres for the SURE guarantee will be calculated using RMA acres. In that case, the participant will be notified of the discrepancy and that refunds of unearned payments may be required after FSA and RMA reconcile acreage data.</P>

                <P>(h) Production from different counties that is commingled on the farm before it was a matter of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will have the NAMP prorated to each respective county by FSA. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable county, if the participant made the location of production of a crop a matter of record before commingling, if the participant does either of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production of the crop was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from the farm in that county; or</P>
                <P>(2) Had the farm's production in that county measured in a manner acceptable to the FSA county committee.</P>
                <P>(i) The FSA county committee will assign production for the purpose of NAMP for the farm if the FSA county committee determines that the participant failed to provide verifiable or reliable production records.</P>

                <P>(k) The participant must supply verifiable or reliable production records to substantiate production to the FSA county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, acceptable production records include: Commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger sheets or load summaries; or appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA. If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or disposed of by means other than commercial channels, acceptable production records for these purposes include: Truck scale tickets; appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA; contemporaneous reliable diaries; or other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous reliable measurements. Determinations of reliability with respect to this paragraph will take into account, as appropriate, the ability of the agency to verify the evidence as well as the similarity of the evidence to reports or data received by FSA for the crop or similar crops. Other factors deemed relevant may also be taken into account.</P>
                <P>(l) If no verifiable or reliable production records are available, the FSA county committee will use the higher of the participant's certification or the maximum average loss level to determine production.</P>
                <P>(m) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.</P>
                <P>(n) FSA may verify the production evidence submitted with records on file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity that received or may have received the reported production.</P>

                <P>(a) Except for value loss crops as specified in § 760.634, a SURE yield will be determined for each crop, type, and intended use on a farm, using the higher of the participant's weighted:</P>
                <P>(1) Adjusted actual production history yield as determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(2) Counter-cyclical yield as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The adjusted actual production history yield, as defined in § 760.602, will be weighted by the applicable crop year total planted and prevented planted acres, by crop, type, and intended use for each county. RMA data will be used for calculating the SURE yield for insured crops.</P>
                <P>(c) The counter-cyclical yield for a crop on a SURE farm will be weighted in such manner as FSA deems fit taking into account a desire for a consistent system and FSA's ability to make timely yield determinations.</P>
                <P>(d) Participants who do not purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage, but who are otherwise eligible for payment, will have a SURE yield determined by the FSA county committee as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) A weighted yield, based on planted and prevented planted acres, the location county, crop type, and intended use, will be determined at 65 percent of the county expected yield for each crop.</P>
                <P>(2) The SURE yield will be the higher of the yield calculated using the method in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or 65 percent of the weighted counter-cyclical yield as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) For those participants with crop insurance but without an adjusted actual production history yield, a SURE yield will be determined by the applicable FSA county committee. This paragraph will apply in the case where the insurance policy does not require an actual production history yield, or where a participant has no production history.</P>

                <P>(a) The Deputy Administrator will authorize FSA county committees, with FSA State committee concurrence, to adjust NAMP for a county or part of a county:</P>
                <P>(1) To reflect the average quality discounts applied to the local or regional market price of a crop due to a reduction in the intrinsic characteristics of the production resulting from adverse weather, as determined annually by the State office of the FSA; or</P>
                <P>(2) To account for a crop for which the value is reduced due to excess moisture resulting from a disaster related condition.</P>

                <P>(3) For adjustments specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, an adjustment factor that represents the regional or local price received for <PRTPAGE P="117"/>the crop in the county will be calculated by the FSA State committee. The adjustment factor will be based on the average actual market price compared to NAMP.</P>
                <P>(b) For adjustments made under paragraph (a) of this section, participants must provide verifiable evidence of actual or appraised production, clearly indicating an average loss of value caused by poor quality or excessive moisture that meets or exceeds the quality adjustment for the county or part of a county established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to be eligible to receive the quality-adjusted NAMP as part of their SURE payment calculation. In order to be considered at all for the purpose of quality adjustments, the verifiable evidence of production must itself detail the extent of the quality loss for a specific quantity. With regard to test evidence, in addition to meeting all the requirements of this section, tests must have been completed by January 1 of the year following harvest.</P>

                <P>(b) To be eligible, a producer must be an individual or entity who is entitled to an ownership share of an eligible crop and who has the production and market risks associated with the agricultural production of the crop on a farm. An eligible producer must be a:</P>
                <P>(1) Citizen of the United States;</P>
                <P>(2) Resident alien, which for purposes of this subpart means “lawful alien” as defined in 7 CFR part 1400;</P>
                <P>(3) Partnership of citizens of the United States; or</P>
                <P>(4) Corporation, limited liability corporation, or other farm organizational structure organized under State law.</P>
                <P>(c) To be eligible, a producer must have:<PRTPAGE P="119"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Produced a 2009 crop year planted or considered planted long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybean, or sweet potato crop in a 2009 eligible disaster county, and</P>
                <P>(2) Suffered a five percent or greater loss in an eligible disaster county in 2009. A list of the disaster counties for CAP is available on the FSA Web site and at FSA county offices.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Time and method of application.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To request a CAP payment, the producer must submit a CAP application on the form designated by FSA to the FSA county office responsible for administration of the farm.</P>
                <P>(b) Producers submitting an application for a crop must certify that they suffered a five percent or greater loss of the crop on the farm in a disaster county and that they have documentation to support that certification as required in § 760.713.</P>
                <P>(c) Once submitted by a producer, the application is considered to contain information and certifications of and pertaining to the producer's crop and farm regardless of who entered the information on the application.</P>
                <P>(d) Producers requesting benefits under CAP must certify the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in the application as well as with any documentation that may be provided with the application or documentation that will be provided to FSA in substantiation of the application. All certifications and information are subject to verification by FSA.</P>
                <P>(e) Producers applying for CAP must certify that they have an eligible ownership share interest in the 2009 crop acreage that sustained a five percent or greater loss. The determination and certification by a producer that a crop suffered the requisite five percent or greater farm crop loss is the expected quantity of production of the crop less the actual production of the crop.</P>
                <P>(f) In the event that the producer does not submit documentation in response to any request of FSA to support the producer's application or documentation furnished does not show a crop loss of at least five percent as claimed, the application for that crop will be disapproved in its entirety. For quantity losses, producers need to apply a standard similar to the historic yield provisions used under previous ad hoc disaster programs. Those provisions provided that a historic yield was the higher of a county average yield or a producer's approved yield. Thus, if an applicant is determining whether a farm has a crop that suffered a loss of five percent or greater on the farm's planted and considered planted acreage, the applicant could compare the amount successfully produced in 2009 from those planted and considered planted acres to what the participant expected to produce from that acreage using either the county average yield (which may be obtained from FSA by request) or based on analysis of approved actual production history yields that may exist for producers of the crop on the farm.</P>
                <P>(g) Unless otherwise determined necessary by FSA, producers will not be required to submit documentation of farm crop production or loss at time of application. FSA's decision not to require proof, documentation, or evidence in support of any application at time of application is not to be construed as a determination of a producer's eligibility.</P>
                <P>(h) Producers who apply are required to retain documentation in support of their application for three years after the date of application in accordance with § 760.713.</P>
                <P>(i) The application submitted in accordance with this section is not considered valid and complete for issuance of payment under this part unless FSA determines all the applicable eligibility provisions have been satisfied and the producer has submitted all the required forms. In addition to the completed, certified application form, if the information for the following forms or certifications is not on file in the FSA county office or is not current for 2009, the producer must also submit:</P>
                <P>(1) Farm operating plan for individual or legal entity;</P>
                <P>(2) Average adjusted gross income statement for 2009; and</P>
                <P>(3) Highly erodible land conservation (HELC) and wetland conservation certification.</P>

                <P>(j) Application approval and payment by FSA does not relieve a producer <PRTPAGE P="120"/>from having to submit any form, records, or documentation required, but not filed at the time of application or payment, according to paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

                <P>(d) The liability of anyone for any penalty or sanction under or in connection with this subpart, or for any refund to FSA or related charge is in addition to any other liability of such person under any civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including, but not limited to: 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001, and 1014; 15 U.S.C. 714; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.</P>
                <P>(e) The regulations in parts 11 and 780 of this title apply to determinations under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(f) Any payment to any person under this subpart will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or its proceeds.</P>
                <P>(g) Any payment made under this subpart will be considered farm revenue for 2009 for the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program.</P>
                <P>(h) The average AGI limitation provisions in part 1400 of this title relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, with certain levels of average adjusted gross income (AGI) apply to each applicant for CAP. Specifically, a person or legal entity with an average adjusted gross nonfarm income, as defined in § 1404.3 of this title, that exceeds $500,000 is not eligible to receive CAP payments.</P>
                <P>(i) No person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined by the rules in part 1400 of this title may receive, directly or indirectly, more than $100,000 in payments under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(j) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this title apply to CAP. Under those rules, any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a producer to directly receive a CAP payment, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest. For CAP, unless otherwise specified in part 1400 of this title, the AGI amount will be that person's or legal entity's average AGI for the three taxable years that precede the 2008 taxable year (that is 2005, 2006, and 2007).</P>
                <P>(k) For the purposes of the effect of lien on eligibility for Federal programs (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), FSA waives the restriction on receipt of funds under CAP but only as to beneficiaries who, as a condition of such waiver, agree to apply the CAP payments to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.</P>
                <P>(l) For CAP, producers are either eligible or ineligible. Therefore, the provisions of § 718.304 of this chapter, “Failure to Fully Comply,” do not apply to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(m) The regulations in subpart B apply to CAP. In addition to those regulations that specifically include subpart H or apply to this part, the following sections specifically apply to this subpart: §§ 760.113(a), 760.114, and 760.116(a).</P>

                <P>(a) Participants will be eligible to receive disaster benefits under this part only if they incurred qualifying quantity or quality losses for the 2005, 2006, or 2007 crops, as further specified in this part, as a result of damaging weather or any related condition. Participants may not receive benefits with respect to volunteer stands of crops.</P>
                <P>(b) Payments may be made for losses suffered by an eligible participant who, at the time of application, is a deceased individual or is a dissolved entity if a representative, who currently has authority to enter into a contract for the participant, signs the 2005, 2006, or 2007 Crop Disaster Program application. Participants must provide proof of the authority to sign legal documents for the deceased individual or dissolved entity. If a participant is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must sign the application for payment.</P>
                <P>(c) As a condition to receive benefits under this part, the Participant must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation provisions of part 12 of this title for the 2005, 2006, or 2007 crop year, as applicable, and must not otherwise be precluded from receiving benefits under parts 12 or 1400 of this title or any law.</P>

                <P>(a) The 2005, 2006, 2007 Crop Disaster Program application must be submitted on a completed FSA-840, or such other form designated for such application purpose by FSA, in the FSA county office in the participant's control county office before the close of business on a date that will be announced by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(b) Once signed by a participant, the application for benefits is considered to contain information and certifications of and pertaining to the participant regardless of who entered the information on the application.</P>
                <P>(c) The participant requesting benefits under this program certifies the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in the application as well as any documentation filed with or in support of the application. All information is subject to verification by FSA. For example, as specified in § 760.818(f), the participant may be required to provide documentation to substantiate and validate quality standards and marketing contract prices. Refusal to allow FSA or any agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in the participant's forfeiting eligibility under this program. Furnishing required information is voluntary; however without it, FSA is under no obligation to act on the application or approve benefits. Providing a false certification to the government is punishable by imprisonment, fines, and other penalties.</P>

                <P>(d) FSA may require the participant to submit any additional information it deems necessary to implement or determine any eligibility provision of this part. For example, as specified in § 760.818(f), the participant may be required to provide documentation to substantiate and validate quality standards and marketing contract prices.<PRTPAGE P="127"/>

                <P>(b) If RMA loss records are not available, or if the FSA county committee determines the RMA loss records are inaccurate or incomplete, or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, participants are responsible for:</P>
                <P>(1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or reliable production records available for the crop;</P>
                <P>(2) Summarizing all the production evidence;</P>
                <P>(3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, whether or not records reflect this production;</P>
                <P>(4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the county committee; and</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determination of production.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Production under this part includes all harvested production, unharvested appraised production, and assigned production for the total planted acreage of the crop on the unit.</P>
                <P>(b) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more than once in a crop year includes the total harvested production from all these harvests.</P>
                <P>(c) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested as the intended use, the actual harvested production must be taken into account to determine benefits. FSA will analyze and determine whether a participant's evidence of actual production represents all that could or would have been harvested.</P>
                <P>(d) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing assistance loans with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent as established by FSA.</P>
                <P>(e) For crops with an established yield and market price for multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated by FSA with respect to the intended use or uses for disaster purposes based on historical production and acreage evidence provided by the participant and FSA will determine the eligible acres for each use.</P>
                <P>(f) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for the crop with no established county average yield and average market price, 42 percent of the salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster payment.</P>
                <P>(g) If a participant does not receive compensation based upon the quantity of the commodity delivered to a purchaser, but has an agreement or contract for guaranteed payment for production, the determination of the production will be the greater of the actual production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as determined by FSA.</P>

                <P>(h) Production that is commingled between units before it was a matter of record or combination of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will be prorated to each respective unit by FSA. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable unit, if the participant made the unit production <PRTPAGE P="132"/>of a commodity a matter of record before commingling and does any of the following, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from beyond the unit;</P>
                <P>(2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the county committee; or</P>
                <P>(3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner acceptable to the county committee.</P>
                <P>(i) The county committee will assign production for the unit when the county committee determines that:</P>
                <P>(1) The participant has failed to provide adequate and acceptable production records;</P>
                <P>(2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not covered by this part, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of loss;</P>
                <P>(3) The participant carries out a practice, such as multiple cropping, that generally results in lower yields than the established historic yields;</P>
                <P>(4) The participant has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for all or a portion of the crop;</P>
                <P>(5) A crop was late-planted;</P>
                <P>(6) Unharvested acreage was not timely appraised; or</P>
                <P>(7) Other appropriate causes exist for such assignment as determined by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(j) For peanuts, the actual production is all peanuts harvested for nuts, regardless of their disposition or use, as adjusted for low quality.</P>
                <P>(k) For tobacco, the actual production is the sum of the tobacco: marketed or available to be marketed; destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as determined by an appraisal.</P>

                <P>(2) The farm containing the multiple-cropped acreage has a history of successful multiple cropping more than one crop on the same acreage in the same crop year, in the year previous to the disaster, or at least 2 of the 4 crop years immediately preceding the disaster crop year based on timely filed crop acreage reports.</P>
                <P>(d) A participant with multiple-cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may be eligible for disaster assistance on more than one crop if the participant has verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful multiple-cropping practice on the specific crops for which assistance is requested. All required records acceptable to FSA as determined by the Deputy Administrator must be provided before payments are issued.</P>

                <P>(e) A participant with multiple-cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section must select the crop for which assistance will be requested. If more than one participant has an interest in <PRTPAGE P="133"/>the multiple cropped acreage, all participants must agree to the crop designated for payment by the end of the application period or no payment will be approved for any crop on the multiple-cropped acreage.</P>
                <P>(f) Benefits under this part apply to irrigated crops where, in cases determined by the Deputy Administrator, acreage was affected by a lack of surface irrigation water due to drought or contamination of ground water or surface irrigation water due to saltwater intrusion. In no case is a loss of ground water, for any reason, an eligible cause of loss.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Limitations on payments and other benefits.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A participant may receive benefits for eligible livestock feed losses, including additional feed costs, for only one of the 2005, 2006, or 2007 calendar years under 2005-2007 LCP, subpart L of this part, or under the CGP of subpart M of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) As specified in § 760.1106(c), the payment under the 2005-2007 LCP may not exceed the smaller of the calculated payment in § 760.1106(a) or the value of the producer's eligible feed loss, increased feed costs, or forage or grazing loss.</P>

                <P>(c) A person may receive no more than $80,000 under 2005-2007 LCP, subpart L of this part. In applying the $80,000 per person payment limitation, regardless of whether the 2005, 2006, or 2007 calendar year benefits are at issue or sought, the most restrictive “person” determination for the participant in the years 2005, 2006, and 2007, will be used to limit benefits. The rules and definitions of part 1400 of this title <PRTPAGE P="142"/>apply in construing who is a qualified separate “person” for purposes of this limit. All payment eligibility requirements of part 1400 as they apply to any other payments, also apply to payments under subpart L of this part.</P>
                <P>(d) For payments under 2005-2007 CGP, a farming operation may receive no more than $80,000, except for general partnerships and joint ventures, in which case assistance will not exceed $80,000 times the number of eligible members of the general partnership or joint venture. This limit must be enforced by the state government administering the grant program.</P>
                <P>(e) The provisions of part 1400, subpart G, of this title apply to these programs. That is the rules that limit the eligibility for benefits of those individuals or entities with an adjusted gross income greater than a certain limit will be applied in the same manner to payments under subparts L and M of this part.</P>
                <P>(f) As a condition to receive benefits under subparts L and M of this part, a participant must have been in compliance with the provisions of parts 12 and 718 of this title for the calendar year for which benefits are being requested and must not otherwise be precluded from receiving benefits under any law.</P>
                <P>(g) An individual or entity determined to be a foreign person under part 1400 of this title is not eligible to receive benefits under subparts L and M of this part.</P>
                <P>(h) In addition to limitations provided in subparts L and M of this part, participants cannot receive duplicate benefits under subparts L and M of this part for the same loss or any similar loss under:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment calculation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Preliminary, unadjusted LCP payments are calculated for a producer by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock category, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, by the number of eligible livestock for the producer in each category. The national payment rate represents the cost of the amount of corn needed to maintain the specific livestock for 30 days, as determined by FSA. As provided in subpart K of this part, a producer may receive benefits for only one of the three program years, 2005, 2006, or 2007. The producer must indicate which year has been chosen. Payments are available only with respect to disaster-related fees losses in the period from January 2, 2005 through February 27, 2007, in eligible counties for losses during the times specified for the disaster periods as specified in § 760.1001(b).</P>
                <P>(b) The preliminary LCP payment calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) For 2005 LCP provided for under this subpart will be reduced by the amount the participant received for the specific livestock under the Feed Indemnity Program in accordance with subpart D of this part and LCP for the 2005 hurricanes under subpart B of part 1416 of this title; and</P>
                <P>(2) For 2006 LCP under this subpart will be reduced by the amount the participant received for the same or similar loss under the Livestock Assistance Grant Program in accordance with subpart H of this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Subject to such other limitations as may apply, including those in paragraph (b) of this section, the payment under the 2005-2007 LCP may not exceed for the relevant year chosen by the producer the smaller of either the:</P>
                <P>(1) Payment calculated in paragraph (a) of this section for that year; or</P>
                <P>(2) Value of the producer's eligible feed loss, increased feed costs, or forage or grazing loss as determined by FSA for that year.</P>
                <P>(d) The actual payment to the producer will be the amount provided for in paragraph (c) of this section subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this section or in this part.</P>

                <P>(a) Producers must be paid for feed losses of higher costs only for one of the three years, 2005, 2006, or 2007, and the loss must be for eligible catfish feed losses in an eligible county, as determined pursuant to subpart K of this part. Further, the feed loss or higher costs must be caused by the disaster <PRTPAGE P="147"/>that caused the county to qualify as an eligible county. The loss, moreover, to qualify for payment, must have occurred during the allowable time period provided in this part, namely the period beginning on January 2, 2005 and ending February 27, 2007. The producer must pick the year of the benefits sought.</P>
                <P>(b) Subject to all adjustments and limits provided for in this part the amount of assistance provided to each participant from the State will be equal to the smaller of:</P>

Providing a false statement, request, or certification to the Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines, other penalties, or sanctions.</P>
                <P>(c) All information provided by the dairy producer or dairy operation is subject to verification, spot check, and audit by FSA.

                <P>(a) Payment under DELAP will only be made to producers, but the dairy “operation” must first qualify its production within limits provided for in this subpart in order to have the individuals or entities that qualify as “producers” receive payment subject to whatever additional limits (such as the adjusted gross income provisions of these regulations) apply. As needed the agency may construe the terms of this regulation in any manner needed to facilitate and expedite payments using existing data and records from other assistance programs. Further, those parties (State and local governments and their political subdivisions and related agencies) excluded from the MILC program will not be eligible for DELAP payments notwithstanding any other provision of these regulation. That said, to be eligible to receive payments under this subpart, a dairy producer in the United States must:</P>
                <P>(1) Have produced milk in the United States and commercially marketed the milk produced any time during February 2009 through July 2009;</P>
                <P>(2) Be a producer, as defined in § 760.1302;</P>

                <P>(3) Provide FSA with proof of milk production commercially marketed by all dairy producers in the dairy operation during February 2009 through July 2009; and<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) Submit an accurate and complete request for benefits as specified in § 760.1303, if production data is not available in the FSA county office.</P>
                <P>(b) To be eligible to receive a payment, each producer in an eligible dairy operation must meet the average adjusted gross income eligibility requirements of 7 CFR part 1400. No person or entity will be eligible to receive any payment or direct or indirect benefit under this subpart if their annual average adjusted nonfarm income is over $500,000 as determined under 7 CFR part 1400. In the case of indirect benefits, direct benefits to other parties will be reduced accordingly. This will mean that all of the attribution rules of part 1400 will apply. For example if Individual A is over the limit and owns 100 percent of Corporation C which had a 20 percent interest in Corporation B which had a 50 percent interest in milk producer Corporation A, the AGI of Individual A would result in a 10 percent (100 percent times 20 percent times 50 percent) loss in benefits to Corporation A. For DELAP, the relevant period for the annual average adjusted nonfarm income is 2005 through 2007.</P>
                <P>(1) Individual dairy producers in a dairy operation that is an entity are only eligible for a payment based on their share of the dairy operation.</P>
                <P>(2) No payment will be made to any other producer based on the share of any dairy producer who exceeds the income limit or who, because of the attribution rules, has their payment reduced.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Proof of production.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Dairy producers requesting benefits must, as required by this subpart, provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's eligible production during the months of February through July 2009, if those records are not already available at the FSA county office. The dairy operation must also provide proof that the eligible production was also commercially marketed during the same period.</P>
                <P>(b) To be eligible for payment, dairy producers marketing milk during February through July 2009 must provide any required supporting documents to assist FSA in verifying production. Supporting documentation may be provided by either the dairy producer or by the dairy operation for each of its producers. Examples of supporting documentation may include, but are not limited to: Milk marketing payment stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies of any payments received as compensation from other sources, or any other documents available to confirm the production and production history of the dairy operation. Dairy operations and producers may also be required to allow FSA to examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting documentation requested is not presented to FSA, the request for benefits will be denied.</P>

                <P>(a) Payments under this subpart are subject to the availability of funds. The total available program funds are $290,000,000.</P>
                <P>(b) FSA will prorate the available funds by a national factor to ensure payments do not exceed $290,000,000. The payment will be made based on the national payment rate as determined by FSA. FSA will prorate the payments based on the amount of milk production eligible for payments in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>
                <P>(c) A reserve will be created to handle new applications, appeals, and errors.</P>

                <P>(a) A dairy operation's payment quantity (the quantity of milk on which the “operation” can generate payments for “producers” involved in the operation) will be determined by FSA, based on the pounds of production of commercially marketed milk during the months of February 2009 through July 2009, multiplied by two.</P>
                <P>(b) The maximum payment quantity for which a dairy operation can generate payments for its dairy producers under this subpart will be 6,000,000 pounds.</P>

                <P>(b) Each eligible dairy producer's payment with respect to an operation will be calculated by multiplying the payment rate determined in paragraph (a) of this section by the dairy producer's share in the dairy operation's eligible production payment quantity as determined in accordance with section § 760.1307.</P>
                <P>(c) In the event that approval of all eligible requests for benefits would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will reduce the payment rate in a manner that FSA determines to be fair and reasonable.</P>

                <P>(b) Any payment to any person or operation engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, must be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due. Any dairy operation or person engaged in acts prohibited by this section and receiving payment under this subpart will be jointly and severally liable with other producers or operations involved in such claim for benefits for any refund due under this section and for related charges.

                <P>(f) The eligible participant's share of a payment under this subpart is based on the participant's ownership entitlement share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no crop was produced, the share of the crop the participant would have received if the crop had been produced. If the participant has no ownership share of the crop, the participant is ineligible for payment.</P>
                <P>(g) Payment factors will be used to calculate payments for crops produced with significant and variable production and harvesting expenses that are not incurred because the crop acreage was prevented planted, or planted but not harvested, as determined by FSA. The use of payment factors is based on whether the crop acreage was unharvested or prevented planted, not whether a participant actually incurs or does not incur expenses. Payment factors are generally applicable to all similarly situated participants and are not established in response to individual participants. Accordingly established payment factors are not appealable under parts 11 and 780 of this title. A crop that is intended for mechanical harvest, but subsequently grazed and not mechanically harvested, will have an unharvested payment factor applied.</P>
                <P>(h) Production from all end uses of a multi-use crop will be calculated separately and summarized together.</P>

                <P>(a) For any record submitted along with the certification of production, the record must be either a verifiable or reliable record that substantiates the certification to the satisfaction of the FSA county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, a record of that disposition must be provided to FSA with the certification.</P>
                <P>(1) Acceptable production records include:</P>
                <P>(i) RMA or NAP records, if accurate and complete;</P>
                <P>(ii) Commercial receipts;</P>

                <P>(iv) Other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous reliable measurements.</P>
                <P>(3) Determinations of reliability with respect to this paragraph will take into account, as appropriate, the ability for FSA to review and verify or compare the evidence against the similarity of the evidence or reports or data received by FSA for the crop or similar crops. Other factors deemed relevant may also be taken into account.</P>
                <P>(b) If RMA or NAP records are not available, or if the FSA county committee determines the RMA or NAP records as reported by the insured or covered participant appear to be questionable or incomplete, or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, the participant is responsible for:</P>
                <P>(1) Retaining and providing, at time of application and whenever required by FSA, the best available verifiable or reliable or other production records for the crop;</P>
                <P>(2) Summarizing all the production evidence;</P>
                <P>(3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, whether or not records reflect this production;</P>
                <P>(4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the FSA county committee; and</P>
                <P>(5) Providing supporting documentation if the FSA county committee has reason to question the disaster event or that all production has been taken into account.</P>
                <P>(c) FSA may verify the production evidence submitted with records on file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity that received or may have received the reported production.</P>
                <P>(d) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.</P>
                <P>(e) Under WHIP+, participants requesting payments for losses to adulterated wine grapes must submit verifiable sales tickets that document that the reduced price received was due to adulteration due to a qualifying disaster event. For adulterated wine grapes that have not been sold, participants must submit verifiable records obtained by testing or analysis to establish that the wine grapes were adulterated due to a qualifying disaster event and the price they would receive due to adulteration.</P>

                <P>(a) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more than once in a crop year includes the total harvested production from all the harvests in the crop year.</P>
                <P>(b) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested as the intended use, the actual harvested production must be taken into account to determine payments. FSA will analyze and determine whether a participant's evidence of actual production represents all that could or would have been harvested.</P>

                <P>(c) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing assistance loans (see parts 1421 and 1434 of this title) with an intended use of grain <PRTPAGE P="165"/>but harvested as silage, ensilage, cabbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be converted to a whole grain equivalent based on conversion factors as previously established by FSA.</P>
                <P>(d) If a participant does not receive compensation based upon the quantity of the commodity delivered to a purchaser, but has an agreement or contract for guaranteed payment for production, the determination of the production will be the greater of the actual production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as determined by FSA.</P>
                <P>(e) Production that is commingled between crop years, units, ineligible and eligible acres, or different practices before it was a matter of record or combination of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will be prorated to each respective year, unit, type of acreage, or practice, respectively. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable unit, if the participant made the unit production of a commodity a matter of record before commingling and does any of the following, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from beyond the unit;</P>
                <P>(2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the FSA county committee; or</P>
                <P>(3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner acceptable to the FSA county committee.</P>
                <P>(f) The FSA county committee will assign production for the unit when the FSA county committee determines that:</P>
                <P>(1) The participant has failed to provide adequate and acceptable production records;</P>
                <P>(2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not covered by this subpart, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of loss;</P>
                <P>(3) The participant carries out a practice, such as multiple cropping, that generally results in lower yields than the established historic yields;</P>
                <P>(5) A crop was late-planted;</P>
                <P>(6) Unharvested acreage was not timely appraised; or</P>
                <P>(7) Other appropriate causes exist for such assignment as determined by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(g) The FSA county committee will establish a county disaster yield that reflects the amount of production producers would have produced considering the eligible disaster events in the county or area for the same crop. The county disaster yield for the county or area will be expressed as either a percent of loss or yield per acre. The county disaster yield will apply when:</P>
                <P>(1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA or a company reinsured by FCIC; or</P>
                <P>(2) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not available from any source.</P>
                <P>(h) In no case will the production amount of any applicant be less than the producer's certified loss.</P>
                <P>(i) Under WHIP+, production for eligible adulterated wine grapes will be adjusted for quality deficiencies due to a qualifying disaster event. Wine grapes are eligible for production adjustment only if adulteration occurred prior to harvest and as a result of a qualifying disaster event or as a result of a related condition (such as application of fire retardant). Losses due to all other causes of adulteration (such as addition of artificial flavoring or chemicals for economic purposes) are not eligible for WHIP+. Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if, due to a qualifying disaster event, it has a value of less than 75 percent of the average market price of undamaged grapes of the same or similar variety. The value per ton of the qualifying damaged production and the average market price of undamaged grapes will be determined on the earlier of the date the damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. Grape production that is eligible for quality adjustment will be reduced by:</P>

                <P>(1) Dividing the value per ton of the damaged grapes by the value per ton for undamaged grapes; and<PRTPAGE P="166"/>
                </P>

All plantings of an annual or biennial crop are considered the same as a planting of an initial crop in tropical regions as defined in part 1437, subpart F, of this title.</P>
                <P>(c) In cases where there is double cropped acreage, each crop may be included in the acreage only if the specific crops are approved by the FSA State committee as eligible double cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator.</P>
                <P>(d) Except for insured crops, participants with double cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may have such acreage included in the acreage on more than one crop only if the participant submits verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful double cropping practice on the specific crops for which payment is requested.</P>

                <P>(1) In the case of an affected farmer who markets his whole milk through a milk handler, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per hundred-weight of whole milk paid during the pay period by such farmer's milk handler in the same area for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer in the base period used to determine his normal marketings; or</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of an affected farmer whose commercial market consists of direct retail sales to consumers, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per hundredweight of whole milk, as determined by the FSA county committee, which other producers in the same area who marketed their whole milk through milk handlers received for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer during the base period used to determine his normal marketings.</P>
                <P>(c) In determining the net price for whole milk, the FSA county committee will deduct from the gross price any transportation, administrative, and other costs of marketing which it determines are normally incurred by the affected farmer but which were not incurred because of the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market.</P>

If the milk handler has information as to the transportation, administrative, and other costs of marketing which are normally incurred by producers who market through the milk handler but which the affected farmer did not incur because of the dumping or removal of his whole milk from the market, the average price stated by the milk handler will be the average gross price paid producers less any such costs.

                <P>(a) The Administrator delegates the responsibility to administer Farm Loan Programs of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) to the Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs subject to any limitations established in 7 CFR 2.16(a)(2) and 7 CFR 2.42.</P>
                <P>(b) The Deputy Administrator:</P>

                <P>(1) Delegates to each State Executive Director within the State Executive Director's jurisdiction the authority, and in the absence of the State Executive Director, the person acting in that position, to act for, on behalf of, and in the name of the United States of America or the Farm Service Agency to do and perform acts necessary in connection with making and guaranteeing loans, such as, but not limited to, making advances, servicing loans and other <PRTPAGE P="178"/>indebtedness, and obtaining, servicing, and enforcing or releasing security and other instruments related to the loan. For actions that do not result in a loss to the Farm Service Agency, a State Executive Director may redelegate authorities received under this paragraph to a Farm Loan Chief, Farm Loan Specialist, District Director, Farm Loan Manager, or Senior Farm Loan Officer, Farm Loan Officer, Loan Analyst, Loan Resolution Specialist, or Program Technician.</P>
                <P>(2) May establish procedures for further redelegation or limitation of authority.</P>
                <P>(c) Parts 761 through 767 describe the Agency's policies for its Farm Loan Programs. The objective of these programs is to provide supervised credit and management assistance to eligible farmers to become owners or operators, or both, of family farms, to continue such operations when credit is not available elsewhere, or to return to normal farming operations after sustaining substantial losses as a result of a designated or declared disaster. The programs are designed to allow those who participate to transition to private commercial credit or other sources of credit in the shortest period of time practicable through the use of supervised credit, including farm assessments, borrower training, market placement, and borrower graduation requirements. These regulations apply to loan applicants, borrowers, lenders, holders, Agency personnel, and other parties involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, or liquidating such loans.</P>
                <P>(d) This part describes the Agency's general and administrative policies for its guaranteed and direct Farm Loan Programs. In general, this part addresses issues that affect both guaranteed and direct loan programs.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subpart contains regulations governing Operating loans, Farm Ownership loans, and Conservation loans guaranteed by the Agency. This subpart applies to lenders, holders, borrowers, Agency personnel, and other parties involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, or liquidating such loans.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lender list.</E> The Agency maintains a current list of lenders who express a desire to participate in the guaranteed loan program. This list is made available to farmers upon request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Lender classification.</E> Lenders who participate in the Agency guaranteed loan program will be classified into one of the following categories:</P>
              <P>(1) Standard Eligible Lender under § 762.105;</P>
              <P>(2) Certified Lender;</P>
              <P>(3) Preferred Lender under § 762.106; or</P>
              <P>(4) Micro Lender under § 762.107.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Type of guarantee.</E> Guarantees are available for both a loan note or a line of credit. A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and term. A line of <PRTPAGE P="202"/>credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The principal amount outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the line of credit ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are evidenced by the same loan guarantee form.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of loan guarantee.</E> The loan guarantee will automatically terminate as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Upon full payment of the guaranteed loan. A zero balance within the period authorized for advances on a line of credit will not terminate the guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Upon payment of a final loss claim; or</P>
              <P>(3) Upon written notice from the lender to the Agency that a guarantee is no longer desired provided the lender holds all of the guaranteed portion of the loan. The loan guarantee will be returned to the Agency office for cancellation within 30 days of the date of the notice by the lender.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Fraud and misrepresentation.</E> The loan guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States. The Agency may contest the guarantee only in cases of fraud or misrepresentation by a lender or holder, in which:</P>
              <P>(1) The lender or holder had actual knowledge of the fraud or misrepresentation at the time it became the lender or holder, or</P>
              <P>(2) The lender or holder participated in or condoned the fraud or misrepresentation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lender violations.</E> The loan guarantee cannot be enforced by the lender, regardless of when the Agency discovers the violation, to the extent that the loss is a result of:</P>
              <P>(1) Violation of usury laws;</P>
              <P>(2) Negligent servicing;</P>
              <P>(3) Failure to obtain the required security; or,</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcement by holder.</E> The guarantee and right to require purchase will be directly enforceable by the holder even if:</P>

              <P>(2) The loan note guarantee is unenforceable by the lender based on a lender violation.</P>

              <P>(b) The lender or Agency may request updated information from the borrower to implement an appeal decision.</P>

              <P>(4) The lender must maintain an office near enough to the collateral's location so it can properly and efficiently discharge its loan making and <PRTPAGE P="203"/>loan servicing responsibilities or use Agency approved agents, correspondents, branches, or other institutions or persons to provide expertise to assist in carrying out its responsibilities. The lender must be a local lender unless it:</P>

              <P>(ii) Demonstrates specific expertise in making and servicing loans for the proposed operation.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Substitution of lenders.</E> A new eligible lender may be substituted for the original lender, upon the original lender's concurrence, under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The Agency approves of the substitution in writing by executing a modification of the guarantee to identify the new lender, the amount of debt at the time of the substitution and any new loan terms if applicable.</P>

              <P>(ii) Execute a lender's agreement if one is not in effect;</P>
              <P>(iii) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(ii) If the loan is subject to an existing interest assistance agreement, submit a request for subsidy for the partial year that it has owned the loan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interest rates, terms, charges, and fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Interest rates.</E> (1) The interest rate on a guaranteed loan or line of credit may be fixed or variable as agreed upon between the borrower and the lender. The lender may charge different rates on the guaranteed and the non-guaranteed portions of the note. The guaranteed portion may be fixed while the unguaranteed portion may be variable, or vice versa. If both portions are variable, different bases may be used.</P>
              <P>(2) If a variable rate is used, it must be tied to an index or rate specifically agreed to between the lender and borrower in the loan instruments and the rate adjustments must be in accordance with normal practices of the lender for unguaranteed loans. Upon request, the lender must provide the Agency with copies of its written rate adjustment practices.</P>
              <P>(3) At the time of loan closing or loan restructuring, the interest rate on both the guaranteed portion and the unguaranteed portion of a fixed or variable rate OL or FO loan may not exceed the following, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) For lenders using risk-based pricing practices, the risk tier at least one tier lower (representing lower risk) than that borrower would receive without a guarantee. The lender must provide the Agency with copies of its written pricing practices, upon request.</P>
              <P>(ii) For lenders not using risk-based pricing practices, for variable rate loans or fixed rate loans with rates fixed for less than five years, 650 basis points (6.5 percentage points) above the 3-month LIBOR.</P>
              <P>(iii) For lenders not using risk-based pricing practices, for loans with rates fixed for five or more years, 550 basis points (5.5 percentage points) above the 5-year Treasury note rate.</P>
              <P>(4) In the event the 3-month LIBOR is below 2 percent, the maximum rates specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section do not apply. In that case, at the time of loan closing or loan restructuring, the interest rate on both the guaranteed portion and the unguaranteed portion of an OL or FO loan may not exceed 750 basis points above the 3-month LIBOR for variable rate loans and 650 basis points above the 5-year Treasury rate for fixed rate loans.</P>
              <P>(5) Interest must be charged only on the actual amount of funds advanced and for the actual time the funds are outstanding. Interest on protective advances made by the lender to protect the security will be charged at the note rate but limited to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) The lender and borrower may collectively obtain a temporary reduction in the interest rate through the interest assistance program in accordance with § 762.150.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">OL terms.</E> (1) Loan funds or advances on a line of credit used to pay <PRTPAGE P="213"/>annual operating expenses will be repaid when the income from the year's operation is received, except when the borrower is establishing a new enterprise, developing a farm, purchasing feed while feed crops are being established, or recovering from disaster or economic reverses.</P>
              <P>(2) The final maturity date for each loan cannot exceed 7 years from the date of the promissory note or line of credit agreement. Advances for purposes other than for annual operating expenses will be scheduled for repayment over the minimum period necessary considering the applicant's ability to repay and the useful life of the security, but not in excess of 7 years.</P>
              <P>(3) All advances on a line of credit must be made within 5 years from the date of the Loan Guarantee.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">FO terms.</E> Each loan must be scheduled for repayment over a period not to exceed 40 years from the date of the note or such shorter period as may be necessary to assure that the loan will be adequately secured, taking into account the probable depreciation of the security.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">CL terms.</E> Each loan must be scheduled for repayment over a period not to exceed 30 years from the date of the note or such shorter period as may be necessary to assure that the loan will be adequately secured, taking into account the probable depreciation of the security.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Balloon installments under loan note guarantee.</E> Balloon payment terms are permitted on FO, OL, or CL subject to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Extended repayment schedules may include equal, unequal, or balloon installments if needed on any guaranteed loan to establish a new enterprise, develop a farm, or recover from a disaster or an economical reversal.</P>
              <P>(2) Loans with balloon installments must have adequate collateral at the time the balloon installment comes due. Crops, livestock other than breeding livestock, or livestock products produced are not sufficient collateral for securing such a loan.</P>
              <P>(3) The borrower must be projected to be able to refinance the remaining debt at the time the balloon payment comes due based on the expected financial condition of the operation, the depreciated value of the collateral, and the principal balance on the loan.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges and fees.</E> (1) The lender may charge the applicant and borrower fees for the loan provided they are no greater than those charged to unguaranteed customers for similar transactions. Similar transactions are those involving the same type of loan requested (for example, operating loans or farm real estate loans).</P>
              <P>(2) Late payment charges (including default interest charges) are not covered by the guarantee. These charges may not be added to the principal and interest due under any guaranteed note or line of credit. However, late payment charges may be made outside of the guarantee if they are routinely made by the lender in similar types of loan transactions.</P>
              <P>(3) Lenders may not charge a loan origination and servicing fee greater than 1 percent of the loan amount for the life of the loan when a guaranteed loan is made in conjunction with a down payment FO under part 764 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(4) For CLP lenders, the projected income and expenses of the borrower and the operation must be based on the applicant's financial history and proven record of financial management.</P>

              <P>(5) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any actual history and any other reliable source of <PRTPAGE P="214"/>information that are agreeable with the lender, the applicant, and the Agency will be used.</P>
              <P>(6) The cash flow budget analyzed to determine a feasible plan must represent the predicted cash flow of the operating cycle.</P>
              <P>(7) Lenders must use price forecasts that are reasonable and defensible. Sources must be documented by the lender and acceptable to the Agency.</P>
              <P>(8) When a feasible plan depends on income from other sources in addition to income from owned land, the income must be dependable and likely to continue.</P>
              <P>(9) The lender will analyze business ventures other than the farm operation to determine their soundness and contribution to the operation. Except for CL, guaranteed loan funds will not be used to finance a nonfarm enterprise. Nonfarm enterprises include, but are not limited to: raising earthworms, exotic birds, tropical fish, dogs, or horses for nonfarm purposes; welding shops; boarding horses; and riding stables.</P>
              <P>(10) When the applicant has or will have a cash flow budget developed in conjunction with a proposed or existing Agency direct loan, the two cash flow budgets must be consistent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Estimating production.</E> Except for streamlined CL guarantees (see § 762.110(f)), the following requirements must be met:</P>
              <P>(1) Standard eligible lenders must use the best sources of information available for estimating production in accordance with this subsection when developing cash flow budgets.</P>
              <P>(2) Deviations from historical performance may be acceptable, if specific to changes in operation and adequately justified and acceptable to the Agency.</P>
              <P>(3) For existing farmers, actual production for the past 3 years will be utilized.</P>
              <P>(4) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any actual history and any other reliable source of information that are agreeable with the lender, the applicant, and the Agency will be used.</P>
              <P>(5) When the production of a growing commodity can be estimated, it must be considered when projecting yields.</P>
              <P>(6) When the applicant's production history has been so severely affected by a declared disaster that an accurate projection cannot be made, the following applies:</P>
              <P>(i) County average yields are used for the disaster year if the applicant's disaster year yields are less than the county average yields. If county average yields are not available, State average yields are used. Adjustments can be made, provided there is factual evidence to demonstrate that the yield used in the farm plan is the most probable to be realized.</P>
              <P>(ii) To calculate a historical yield, the crop year with the lowest actual or county average yield may be excluded, provided the applicant's yields were affected by disasters at least 2 of the previous 5 consecutive years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Refinancing.</E> Loan guarantee requests for refinancing must ensure that a reasonable chance for success still exists. The lender must demonstrate that problems with the applicant's operation that have been identified, can be corrected, and the operation returned to a sound financial basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">EZ Guarantee feasibility.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:</P>

              <P>(1) The Agency will evaluate EZ Guarantee application financial feasibility using criteria determined and announced by the Agency on the FSA Web site (<E T="03">www.fsa.usda.gov</E>).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">EZ Guarantee</E> applications that satisfy the criteria will be determined to meet the financial feasibility standards in this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Security requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The lender is responsible for ensuring that proper and adequate security is obtained and maintained to fully secure the loan, protect the interest of the lender and the Agency, and assure repayment of the loan or line of credit.</P>

              <P>(2) The lender will obtain a lien on additional security when necessary to protect the Agency's interest.<PRTPAGE P="215"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Guaranteed and unguaranteed portions.</E> (1) All security must secure the entire loan or line of credit. The lender may not take separate security to secure only that portion of the loan or line of credit not covered by the guarantee.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender may not require compensating balances or certificates of deposit as means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the unguaranteed portion of the loan or line of credit. However, compensating balances or certificates of deposit as otherwise used in the ordinary course of business are allowed for both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Identifiable security.</E> The guaranteed loan must be secured by identifiable collateral. To be identifiable, the lender must be able to distinguish the collateral item and adequately describe it in the security instrument.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Type of security.</E> (1) Guaranteed loans may be secured by any property if the term of the loan and expected life of the property will not cause the loan to be undersecured.</P>
              <P>(2) For loans with terms greater than 7 years, a lien must be taken on real estate.</P>
              <P>(3) Loans can be secured by a mortgage on leasehold properties if the lease has a negotiable value and is subject to being mortgaged.</P>
              <P>(4) The lender or Agency may require additional personal and corporate guarantees to adequately secure the loan. These guarantees are separate from, and in addition to, the personal obligations arising from members of an entity signing the note as individuals.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Lien position.</E> All guaranteed loans will be secured by the best lien obtainable. Provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) Any chattel-secured guaranteed loan must have a higher lien priority (including purchase money interest) than an unguaranteed loan secured by the same chattels and held by the same lender.</P>
              <P>(2) Junior lien positions are acceptable only if the total amount of debt with liens on the security, including the debt in junior lien position, is less than or equal to 85 percent of the value of the security. Junior liens on crops or livestock products will not be relied upon for security unless the lender is involved in multiple guaranteed loans to the same borrower and also has the first lien on the collateral.</P>
              <P>(3) When taking a junior lien, prior lien instruments will not contain future advance clauses (except for taxes, insurance, or other reasonable costs to protect security), or cancellation, summary forfeiture, or other clauses that jeopardize the Government's or the lender's interest or the borrower's ability to pay the guaranteed loan, unless any such undesirable provisions are limited, modified, waived or subordinated by the lienholder for the benefit of the Agency and the lender.</P>
              <P>(f) Additional security, or any loan of $10,000 or less may be secured by the best lien obtainable on real estate without title clearance or legal services normally required, provided the lender believes from a search of the county records that the applicant can give a mortgage on the farm and provided that the lender would, in the normal course of business, waive the title search. This exception to title clearance will not apply when land is to be purchased.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Multiple owners.</E> If security has multiple owners, all owners must execute the security documents for the loan.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has the authority to grant an exception to any of the requirements involving security, if the proposed change is in the best interest of the Government and the collection of the loan will not be impaired.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Appraisal requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The general requirements for an appraisal are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Value of collateral.</E> The lender is responsible for ensuring that the value of chattel and real estate pledged as collateral is sufficient to fully secure the guaranteed loan.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional security.</E> The lender is not required to complete an appraisal or evaluation of collateral that will serve as additional security, but the lender must provide an estimated value.<PRTPAGE P="216"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Appraisal cost.</E> Except for authorized liquidation expenses, the lender is responsible for all appraisal costs, which may be passed on to the borrower or transferee in the case of a transfer and assumption.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Chattel security.</E> The requirements for chattel appraisals are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Need for chattel appraisal.</E> A current appraisal (not more than 12 months old) of primary chattel security is required on all loans except loans or lines of credit for annual production purposes secured by crops, which require an appraisal only when the guarantee is requested late in the current production year and actual yields can be reasonably estimated. An appraisal is not required for loans of $50,000 or less if a strong equity position exists.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Basis of value.</E> The appraised value of chattel property will be based on public sales of the same or similar property in the market area. In the absence of such public sales, reputable publications reflecting market values may be used.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Appraisal form.</E> Appraisal reports may be on the Agency's appraisal of chattel property form or on any other appraisal form containing at least the same information.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Experience and training.</E> Chattel appraisals will be performed by appraisers who possess sufficient experience or training to establish market (not retail) values as determined by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Real estate security.</E> The requirements for real estate appraisals are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Loans of $250,000 or less.</E> The lender must document the value of the real estate by applying the same policies and procedures as their non-guaranteed loans.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Loans greater than $250,000.</E> The lender must document the value of real estate using a current appraisal (not more than 12 months old) completed by a State Certified General Appraiser. Real estate appraisals must be completed in accordance with USPAP. Restricted reports as defined in USPAP are not acceptable. The Agency may allow an appraisal more than 12 months old to be used only if documentation provided by the lender reflects each of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Market conditions have remained stable or improved based on sales of similar properties,</P>
              <P>(ii) The property in question remains in the same or better condition, and</P>
              <P>(iii) The value of the property has remained the same or increased.</P>
              <P>(3) Agency determinations under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to permit appraisals more than 12 months old are not appealable.</P>

CLP, PLP, and MLP lenders may certify that they have documentation in their file to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (c) of this section. Standard eligible lenders must submit evidence supporting compliance with this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination.</E> The Agency determination of whether an environmental problem exists will be based on:</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) The lender will assist the borrower in securing any applicable permits or waste management plans. The lender may consult with the Agency for guidance on activities which require consultation with State regulatory agencies, special permitting or waste management plans.</P>
              <P>(3) The lender will examine the security property to determine if there are any structures or archeological sites which are listed or may be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The lender may consult with the Agency for guidance on which situations will need further review in accordance with the National Historical Preservation Act and part 799 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) The applicant must certify they will not violate the provisions of § 363 of the Act, the Food Security Act of 1985, and Executive Order 11990 relating to Highly Erodible Land and Wetlands.</P>
              <P>(5) All lenders are required to ensure that due diligence is performed in conjunction with a request for guarantee of a loan involving real estate. Due diligence is the process of evaluating real estate in the context of a real estate transaction to determine the presence of contamination from release of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other environmental hazards and determining what effect, if any, the contamination has on the security value of the property. The Agency will accept as evidence of due diligence the most current version of the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) transaction screen questionnaire available from 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, or similar documentation, approved for use by the Agency, supplemented as necessary by the ASTM phase I environmental site assessments form.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination.</E> (1) With respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, the lender will not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age, provided the applicant can execute a legal contract. Nor will the lender discriminate on the basis of whether all or a part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or whether the applicant in good faith, exercises any rights under the Consumer Protection Act.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the guaranteed loan involves construction, the contractor or subcontractor must file all compliance reports, equal opportunity and nondiscrimination forms, and otherwise comply with all regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Executive Orders 11246 and 11375.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other Federal, State and local requirements.</E> Lenders are required to coordinate with all appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and comply with special laws and regulations applicable to the loan proposal.</P>

In order to facilitate servicing and simplified accounting of loan transactions, lenders are encouraged to repurchase the loan upon the holder's request.</P>
              <P>(2) The repurchase by the lender will be for an amount equal to the portion of the loan held by the holder plus accrued interest.</P>

              <P>(iii) In the case of a request for Agency purchase, the Agency will only pay interest that accrues for up to 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the lender requesting the repurchase. However, if the holder requested repurchase from the Agency within 60 days of the request to the lender and for any reason not attributable to the holder and the lender, the Agency cannot make payment within 30 days of the holder's demand to the Agency, the holder will be entitled to interest to the date of payment.</P>
              <P>(4) At the time of purchase by the Agency, the original assignment of guarantee will be assigned by the holder to the Agency without recourse, including all rights, title, and interest in the loan.</P>
              <P>(5) Purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any of the lender's obligations to the Agency specified in the lender's agreement or guarantee; nor does the purchase waive any of the Agency's rights against the lender.</P>
              <P>(6) The Agency succeeds to all rights of the holder under the Guarantee including the right of set-off against the lender.</P>
              <P>(7) Within 180 days of the Agency's purchase, the lender will reimburse the Agency the amount of repurchase, with accrued interest, through one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(i) By liquidating the loan security and paying the Agency its pro-rata share of liquidation proceeds; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Paying the Agency the full amount the Agency paid to the holder plus any accrued interest.</P>
              <P>(8) The lender will be liable for the purchase amount and any expenses incurred by the Agency to maintain the loan in its portfolio or liquidate the security. While the Agency holds the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender will transmit to the Agency any payment received from the borrower, including the pro-rata share of liquidation or other proceeds.</P>
              <P>(9) If the borrower files for reorganization under the provisions of the bankruptcy code or pays the account current while the purchase by the Government is being processed, the Agency may hold the loan as long it determines this action to be in the Agency's interest. If the lender is not proceeding expeditiously to collect the loan or reimbursement is not waived under this paragraph, the Agency will demand payment by the lender and collect the purchase amount through administrative offset of any claims due the lender.</P>
              <P>(10) The Agency may sell a purchased guaranteed loan on a non-recourse basis if it determines that selling the portion of the loan that it holds is in the Government's best interest. A non-recourse purchase from the Agency requires a written request to the Agency from the party that wishes to purchase it, and written concurrence from the lender;</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Repurchase for servicing.</E> (1) If, due to loan default or imminent loan restructuring, the lender determines that repurchase is necessary to adequately service the loan, the lender may repurchase the guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder, with the written approval of the Agency.</P>

              <P>(2) The lender will not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage purposes. With its request for Agency concurrence, the lender will notify the Agency of its plans to resell the guaranteed portion following servicing.<PRTPAGE P="226"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The holder will sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to the lender for an amount agreed to between the lender and holder.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Restructuring guaranteed loans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) To restructure guaranteed loans standard eligible lenders must:</P>
              <P>(i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency for all restructuring actions; and,</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide the items in paragraph (b) and (e) of this section to the Agency for approval.</P>
              <P>(2) If the standard eligible lender's proposal for servicing is not agreed to by the Agency, the Agency approval official will notify the lender in writing within 14 days of the lender's request.</P>
              <P>(3) To restructure guaranteed loans CLP lenders must:</P>
              <P>(i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency only for debt write down under this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Submit all calculations required in paragraph (e) of this section for debt writedown.</P>
              <P>(iii) For restructuring other than write down, provide FSA with a certification that each requirement of this section has been met, a narrative outlining the circumstances surrounding the need for restructuring, and copies of any applicable calculations.</P>
              <P>(4) PLP lenders will restructure loans in accordance with their lender's agreement.</P>
              <P>(5) All lenders will submit copies of any restructured notes or lines of credit to the Agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> For any restructuring action, the following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The borrower meets the eligibility criteria of § 762.120, except the provisions regarding prior debt forgiveness and delinquency on a federal debt do not apply.</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower's ability to make the amended payment is documented by the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A feasible plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) Current financial statements from all liable parties.</P>
              <P>(iii) Verification of nonfarm income.</P>
              <P>(iv) Verification of all debts of $1,000 or more.</P>
              <P>(v) Applicable credit reports.</P>
              <P>(vi) Financial history (and production history for standard eligible lenders) for the past 3 years to support the cash flow projections.</P>
              <P>(3) A final loss claim may be reduced, adjusted, or rejected as a result of negligent servicing after the concurrence with a restructuring action under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Loans secured by real estate and/or equipment can be restructured using a balloon payment, equal installments, or unequal installments. Under no circumstances may livestock or crops alone be used as security for a loan to be rescheduled using a balloon payment. If a balloon payment is used, the projected value of the real estate and/or equipment security must indicate that the loan will be fully secured when the balloon payment becomes due. The projected value will be derived from a current appraisal adjusted for depreciation of depreciable property, such as buildings and other improvements, that occurs until the balloon payment is due. For equipment security, a current appraisal is required. The lender is required to project the security value of the equipment at the time the balloon payment is due based on the remaining life of the equipment, or the depreciation schedule on the borrower's Federal income tax return. Loans restructured with a balloon payment that are secured by real estate will have a minimum term of 5 years, and other loans will have a minimum term of 3 years before the scheduled balloon payment. If statutory limits on terms of loans prevent the minimum terms, balloon payments may not be used. If the loan is rescheduled with unequal installments, a feasible plan, as defined in § 762.2(b), must be projected for when installments are scheduled to increase.</P>
              <P>(5) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make a payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted prior to the payment coming due.</P>

              <P>(6) The lender may capitalize the outstanding interest when restructuring the loan as follows:<PRTPAGE P="227"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) As a result of the capitalization of interest, a rescheduled promissory note may increase the amount of principal the borrower is required to pay. However, in no case will such principal amount exceed the statutory loan limits contained in § 761.8 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) When accrued interest causes the loan amount to exceed the statutory loan limits, rescheduling may be approved without capitalization of the amount that exceeds the limit. Noncapitalized interest may be scheduled for repayment over the term of the rescheduled note.</P>
              <P>(iii) Only interest that has accrued at the rate indicated on the borrower's original promissory notes may be capitalized. Late payment fees or default interest penalties that have accrued due to the borrower's failure to make payments as agreed are not covered under the guarantee and may not be capitalized.</P>
              <P>(iv) The Agency will execute a modification of guarantee form to identify the new loan principal and the guaranteed portion if greater than the original loan amounts, and to waive the restriction on capitalization of interest, if applicable, to the existing guarantee documents. The modification form will be attached to the original guarantee as an addendum.</P>
              <P>(v) Approved capitalized interest will be treated as part of the principal and interest that accrues thereon, in the event that a loss should occur.</P>
              <P>(7) The lender's security position will not be adversely affected because of the restructuring. New security instruments may be taken if needed, but a loan does not have to be fully secured in order to be restructured, unless it is restructured with a balloon payment. When a loan is restructured using a balloon payment the lender must take a lien on all assets and project the loan to be fully secured at the time the balloon payment becomes due, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Any holder agrees to any changes in the original loan terms. If the holder does not agree, the lender must repurchase the loan from the holder for any loan restructuring to occur.</P>
              <P>(9) After a guaranteed loan is restructured, the lender must provide the Agency with a copy of the restructured promissory note.</P>
              <P>(10) For CL, the lender must ensure that the borrower is maintaining the practice for which the CL was made.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rescheduling.</E> The following conditions apply when a guaranteed loan is rescheduled or reamortized:</P>
              <P>(1) Payments will be rescheduled within the following terms:</P>
              <P>(i) FO and existing SW may be amortized over the remaining term of the note or rescheduled with an uneven payment schedule. The maturity date cannot exceed 40 years from the date of the original note.</P>
              <P>(ii) OL notes must be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 15 years from the date of the rescheduling. An OL line of credit may be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 7 years from the date of the rescheduling or 10 years from the date of the original note, whichever is less. Advances cannot be made against a line of credit loan that has had any portion of the loan rescheduled.</P>
              <P>(iii) CL will be amortized over the remaining term or rescheduled with an uneven payment schedule. The maturity date cannot exceed 30 years from the date of the original note.</P>
              <P>(2) The interest rate for a rescheduled loan is the negotiated rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the action, subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.</P>
              <P>(3) A new note is not necessary when rescheduling occurs. However, if a new note is not taken, the existing note or line of credit agreement must be modified by attaching an allonge or other legally effective amendment, evidencing the revised repayment schedule and any interest rate change. If a new note is taken, the new note must reference the old note and state that the indebtedness evidenced by the old note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The original note or line of credit agreement must be retained.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Deferrals.</E> The following conditions apply to deferrals:</P>

              <P>(1) Payments may be deferred up to 5 years, but the loan may not be extended beyond the final due date of the note.<PRTPAGE P="228"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The principal portion of the payment may be deferred either in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(3) Interest may be deferred only in part. Payment of a reasonable portion of accruing interest as indicated by the borrower's cash flow projections is required for multi-year deferrals.</P>
              <P>(4) There must be a reasonable prospect that the borrower will be able to resume full payments at the end of the deferral period.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Debt writedown.</E> The following conditions apply to debt writedown:</P>
              <P>(1) A lender may only write down a delinquent guaranteed loan or line of credit in an amount sufficient to permit the borrower to develop a feasible plan as defined in § 762.102(b).</P>
              <P>(2) The lender will request other creditors to negotiate their debts before a writedown is considered.</P>
              <P>(3) The borrower cannot develop a feasible plan after consideration is given to rescheduling and deferral under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The present value of the loan to be written down, based on the interest rate of the rescheduled loan, will be equal to or exceed the net recovery value of the loan collateral.</P>
              <P>(5) The loan will be restructured with regular payments at terms no shorter than 5 years for a line of credit and OL term note; and no shorter than 20 years for FO and CL, unless required to be shorter by paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) No further advances may be made on a line of credit that is written down.</P>
              <P>(7) Loans may not be written down with interest assistance. If a borrower's loan presently on interest assistance requires a writedown, the writedown will be considered without interest assistance.</P>
              <P>(8) The writedown is based on writing down the shorter-term loans first.</P>
              <P>(9) When a lender requests approval of a writedown for a borrower with multiple loans, the security for all of the loans will be cross-collateralized and continue to serve as security for the loan that is written down. If a borrower has multiple loans and one loan is written off entirely through debt writedown, the security for that loan will not be released and will remain as security for the other written down debt. Additional security instruments will be taken if required to cross-collateralize security and maintain lien priority.</P>
              <P>(10) The writedown will be evidenced by an allonge or amendment to the existing note or line of credit reflecting the writedown.</P>
              <P>(11) The borrower executes an Agency shared appreciation agreement for loans which are written down and secured by real estate.</P>
              <P>(i) The lender will attach the original agreement to the restructured loan document.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lender will provide the Agency a copy of the executed agreement, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Security instruments must ensure future collection of any appreciation under the agreement.</P>
              <P>(12) The lender will prepare and submit the following to the Agency:</P>
              <P>(i) A current appraisal of all security in accordance with § 762.127.</P>
              <P>(ii) A completed report of loss on the appropriate Agency form for the proposed writedown loss claim.</P>
              <P>(iii) Detailed writedown calculations as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Calculate the present value.</P>
              <P>(B) Determine the net recovery value.</P>
              <P>(C) If the net recovery value exceeds the present value, writedown is unavailable; liquidation becomes the next servicing consideration. If the present value equals or exceeds the net recovery value, the debt may be written down to the present value.</P>
              <P>(iv) The lender will make any adjustment in the calculations as requested by the Agency.</P>

              <P>(2) SEL and CLP lenders must not make additional loans or advances <PRTPAGE P="229"/>without prior written approval of the Agency, except as provided in the borrower's loan or line of credit agreement.</P>
              <P>(3) In cases of a guaranteed line of credit, lenders may make an emergency advance when a line of credit has reached its ceiling. The emergency advance will be made as an advance under the line and not as a separate note. The lender's loan documents must contain sufficient language to provide that any emergency advance will constitute a debt of the borrower to the lender and be secured by the security instrument. The following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The loan funds to be advanced are for authorized operating loan purposes;</P>
              <P>(ii) The financial benefit to the lender and the Government from the advance will exceed the amount of the advance; and</P>

              <P>(4) Protective advance requirements are found in § 762.149.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Release of liability upon withdrawal.</E> An individual who is obligated on a guaranteed loan may be released from liability by a lender, with the written consent of the Agency, provided the following conditions have been met:</P>
              <P>(1) The individual to be released has withdrawn from the farming operation;</P>
              <P>(2) A divorce decree or final property settlement does not hold the withdrawing party responsible for the loan payments;</P>
              <P>(3) The withdrawing party's interest in the security is conveyed to the individual or entity with whom the loan will be continued;</P>
              <P>(4) The ratio of the amount of debt to the value of the remaining security is less than or equal to .75, or the withdrawing party has no income or assets from which collection can be made; and</P>
              <P>(5) Withdrawal of the individual does not result in legal dissolution of the entity to which the loans are made. Individually liable members of a general or limited partnership may not be released from liability.</P>

              <P>(ii) The prospect that the borrower or guarantor will inherit assets in the near term that may be attached by the Agency for payment of a significant portion of the debt;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether collateral has been properly accounted for, and whether liability should be retained in order to take action against the borrower or a third party for conversion of security;</P>
              <P>(iv) The availability of other income or assets which are not security;</P>
              <P>(v) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred;</P>
              <P>(vi) The effect of other guarantors on the loan; and</P>

              <P>(2) If the loan has been sold on the secondary market, the lender must repurchase the loan or obtain the holder's written consent.</P>
              <P>(3) To change a fixed rate of interest to a variable rate of interest or vice versa, the lender and the borrower must execute a legally effective allonge or amendment to the existing note.</P>

              <P>(2) Only OL may be consolidated.</P>
              <P>(3) Existing lines of credit may only be consolidated with a new line of credit if the final maturity date and conditions for advances of the new line of credit are made the same as the existing line of credit.</P>
              <P>(4) Guaranteed OL may not be consolidated with a line of credit, even if the line of credit has been rescheduled.</P>

              <P>(6) OL secured by real estate or with an outstanding interest assistance agreement or shared appreciation agreement cannot be consolidated.</P>
              <P>(7) A new note or line of credit agreement will be taken. The new note or line of credit agreement must describe the note or line of credit agreement being consolidated and must state that the indebtedness evidenced by the note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The original note or line of credit agreement must be retained.</P>
              <P>(8) The interest rate for a consolidated OL loan is the negotiated rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the action, subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.</P>
              <P>(9) The Agency approves the consolidation by executing a modification of guarantee. The modification will indicate the consolidated loan amount, new terms, and percentage of guarantee, and will be attached to the originals of the guarantees being consolidated. If loans with a different guarantee percentage are consolidated, the new guarantee will be at the lowest percentage of guarantee being consolidated</P>
              <P>(10) Any holders must consent to the consolidation, or the guaranteed portion must be repurchased by the lender.</P>

              <P>(i) If recapture is triggered under the shared appreciation agreement and the borrower is unable to pay the recapture in a lump sum, the lender may:</P>
              <P>(A) Reschedule the recapture debt with the consent of the Agency, provided the lender can document the borrower's ability to make amortized payments on the recapture debt, plus pay all other obligations. In such case, the recapture debt will not be covered by the guarantee;</P>

              <P>(ii) A proposed method of maximizing the collection of debt which includes specific plans to collect any remaining loan balances on the guaranteed loan after loan collateral has been liquidated, including possibilities for judgment;</P>
              <P>(A) If the borrower has converted loan security, the lender will determine whether litigation is cost effective. The lender must address, in the liquidation plan, whether civil or criminal action will be pursued. If the lender does not pursue the recovery, the reason must be documented when an estimated loss claim is submitted.</P>
              <P>(B) Any proposal to release the borrower from liability will be addressed in the liquidation plan in accordance with § 762.146(c)(2);</P>

              <P>(2) If, within 20 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the liquidation plan, the Agency fails to approve it or fails to request that the lender make revisions, the lender may assume the plan is approved.

              <P>(i) Upon Agency request, the lender will transfer to the Agency all rights and interests necessary to allow the Agency to liquidate the loan. The Agency will not pay the lender for any loss until after the collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined; and</P>

The estimated loss will be based on the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The Agency will pay the lender the guaranteed percentage of the total outstanding debt, less the net recovery value of the remaining security, less any unaccounted for security; and</P>

              <P>(2) The lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted loan at the time the estimated loss claim is paid by the Agency. The Agency will not pay interest beyond 210 days from the <PRTPAGE P="234"/>payment due date.

The following exceptions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in cases where the lender filed an estimated loss claim, the Agency will pay the lender interest that accrues during and up to 45 days after the discharge on the portion of the chattel only secured debt that was estimated to be secured, but upon final liquidation was found to be unsecured, and up to 90 days after the date of discharge on the portion of real estate secured debt that was estimated to be secured, but was found to be unsecured upon final disposition.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Agency will pay the lender interest that accrues during and up to 90 days after the time period the lender is unable to dispose of acquired property due to state imposed redemption rights on any unsecured portion of the loan during the redemption period, if an estimated loss claim was paid by the Agency during the liquidation action.</P>
              <P>(3) Packager fees and outside consultant fees for servicing of guaranteed loans are not covered by the guarantee, and will not be paid in an estimated loss claim.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Protective advances.</E> (1) Prior written authorization from the Agency is required for all protective advances in excess of $5,000 for CLP lenders and $3,000 for standard eligible lenders. The dollar amount of protective advances allowed for PLP lenders will be specified when PLP status is awarded by the Agency or as contained in the lender's agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as protective advances as allowed in this part, plus interest that accrues on the protective advances.</P>
              <P>(3) Payment for protective advances is made by the Agency when the final loss claim is approved, except in bankruptcy actions.</P>
              <P>(4) Protective advances are used only when the borrower is in liquidation, liquidation is imminent, or when the lender has taken title to real property in a liquidation action.</P>
              <P>(5) Legal fees are not a protective advance.</P>
              <P>(6) Protective advances may only be made when the lender can demonstrate the advance is in the best interest of the lender and the Agency.</P>

              <P>(8) Protective advances must not be made in lieu of additional loans.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Unapproved loans or advances.</E> The amount of any payments made by the borrower on unapproved loans or advances outside of the guarantee will be deducted from any loss claim submitted by the lender on the guaranteed loan, if that loan or advance was paid prior to, and to the detriment of, the guaranteed loan.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Acceleration.</E> (1) If the borrower is not in bankruptcy, the lender shall send the borrower notice that the loan is in default and the entire debt has been determined due and payable immediately after other servicing options have been exhausted.</P>
              <P>(2) The loan cannot be accelerated until after the borrower has been considered for interest assistance and the conclusion of mandatory mediation in accordance with § 762.149.</P>
              <P>(3) The lender will submit a copy of the acceleration notice or other document to the Agency.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Foreclosure.</E> (1) The lender is responsible for determining the necessary parties to any foreclosure action, or who should be named on a deed of conveyance taken in lieu of foreclosure.</P>
              <P>(2) When the property is liquidated, the lender will apply the net proceeds to the guaranteed loan debt.</P>

              <P>(3) When it is necessary to enter a bid at a foreclosure sale, the lender may bid the amount that it determines is reasonable to protect its and the Agency's interest. At a minimum, the lender will bid the lesser of the net recovery value or the unpaid guaranteed loan balance.<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Final loss claims.</E> (1) Lenders must submit a final loss claim when the security has been liquidated and all proceeds have been received and applied to the account. All proceeds must be applied to principal first and then toward accrued interest if the interest is still accruing. The application of the loss claim payment to the account does not automatically release the borrower of liability for any portion of the borrower's debt to the lender. The lender will continue to be responsible for collecting the full amount of the debt and sharing these future recoveries with the Agency in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a lender acquires title to property either through voluntary conveyance or foreclosure proceeding, the lender will submit a final loss claim after disposing of the property. The lender may pay reasonable maintenance expenses to protect the value of the property while it is owned by the lender. These may be paid as protective advances or deducted as liquidation expenses from the sales proceeds when the lender disposes of the property. The lender must obtain Agency written concurrence before incurring maintenance expenses which exceed the amounts allowed in § 762.149(e)(1). Packager fees and outside consultant fees for servicing of guaranteed loans are not covered by the guarantee, and will not be paid in a final loss claim.</P>
              <P>(3) The lender will make its records available to the Agency for the Agency's audit of the propriety of any loss payment.</P>
              <P>(4) All lenders will submit the following documents with a final loss claim:</P>
              <P>(i) An accounting of the use of loan funds;</P>
              <P>(ii) An accounting of the disposition of loan security and its proceeds;</P>
              <P>(iii) A copy of the loan ledger indicating loan advances, interest rate changes, protective advances, and application of payments, rental proceeds, and security proceeds, including a running outstanding balance total; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Documentation, as requested by the Agency, concerning the lender's compliance with the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(5) The Agency will notify the lender of any discrepancies in the final loss claim or, approve or reject the claim within 40 days. Failure to do so will result in additional interest being paid to the lender for the number of days over 40 taken to process the claim.</P>
              <P>(6) The Agency will reduce a final loss claim based on its calculation of the dollar amount of loss caused by the lender's negligent servicing of the account. Loss claims may be reduced or rejected as a result of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A loss claim may be reduced by the amount caused by the lender's failure to secure property after a default, and will be reduced by the amount of interest that accrues when the lender fails to contact the borrower or takes no action to cure the default, once it occurs. Losses incurred as a result of interest accrual during excessive delays in collection, as determined by the Agency, will not be paid.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unauthorized release of security proceeds, failure to verify ownership or possession of security to be purchased, or failure to inspect collateral as often required so as to ensure its maintenance.</P>
              <P>(7) Losses will not be reduced for the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Servicing deficiencies that did not contribute materially to the dollar amount of the loss.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unaccounted security, as long as the lender's efforts to locate and recover the missing collateral was equal to that which would have been expended in the case of an unguaranteed loan in the lender's portfolio.</P>
              <P>(8) Default interest, late charges, and loan servicing fees are not payable under the loss claim.</P>
              <P>(9) The final loss will be the remaining outstanding balance after application of the estimated loss payment and the application of proceeds from the liquidation of the security.</P>
              <P>(10) If the final loss is less than the estimated loss, the lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment, plus interest at the note rate from the date of the estimated loss payment.</P>

              <P>(11) The lender will return the original guarantee marked paid after receipt of a final loss claim.<PRTPAGE P="236"/>
              </P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Future Recovery.</E> The lender will remit any recoveries made on the account after the Agency's payment of a final loss claim to the Agency in proportion to the percentage of guarantee, in accordance with the lender's agreement, until the account is paid in full or otherwise satisfied.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> The lender will repay any final loss overpayment determined by the Agency upon request.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Electronic funds transfer.</E> The lender will designate one or more financial institutions to which any Agency payments will be made via electronic funds transfer.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Establishment of Federal debt.</E> Any amounts paid by the Agency on account of liabilities of the guaranteed loan borrower will constitute a Federal debt owing to the Agency by the guaranteed loan borrower. In such case, the Agency may use all remedies available to it, including offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the debt from the borrower. Interest charges will be established at the note rate of the guaranteed loan on the date the final loss claim is paid.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interest assistance program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requests for interest assistance.</E> In addition to the loan application items required by § 762.110, to apply for interest assistance the lender's cash flow budget for the guaranteed applicant must reflect the need for interest assistance and the ability to cash flow with the subsidy. Interest assistance is available only on new guaranteed Operating Loans (OL).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility requirements.</E> The lender must document that the following conditions have been met for the applicant to be eligible for interest assistance:</P>
              <P>(1) A feasible plan cannot be achieved without interest assistance, but can be achieved with interest assistance.</P>
              <P>(2) If significant changes in the borrower's cash flow budget are anticipated after the initial 12 months, then the typical cash flow budget must demonstrate that the borrower will still have a feasible plan following the anticipated changes, with or without interest assistance.</P>
              <P>(3) The typical cash flow budget must demonstrate that the borrower will have a feasible plan throughout the term of the loan.</P>
              <P>(4) The borrower, including members of an entity borrower, does not own any significant assets that do not contribute directly to essential family living or farm operations. The lender must determine the market value of any such non-essential assets and prepare a cash flow budget and interest assistance calculations based on the assumption that these assets will be sold and the market value proceeds used for debt reduction. If a feasible plan can then be achieved, the borrower is not eligible for interest assistance.</P>
              <P>(5) A borrower may only receive interest assistance if their total debts (including personal debts) prior to the new loan exceed 50 percent of their total assets (including personal assets). An entity's debt to asset ratio will be based upon a financial statement that consolidates business and personal debts and assets of the entity and its members. Beginning farmers § 761.2(b) of this chapter, as defined in § 762.102, are excluded from this requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Maximum assistance.</E> The maximum total guaranteed OL debt on which a borrower can receive interest assistance is $400,000, regardless of the number of guaranteed loans outstanding. This is a lifetime limit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum time for which interest assistance is available.</E> (1) A borrower may only receive interest assistance for one 5-year period. The term of the interest assistance agreement executed under this section shall not exceed 5 consecutive years from the date of the initial agreement signed by the applicant, including any entity members, or the outstanding term of the loan, whichever is less. This is a lifetime limit.</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning farmers § 761.2(b) of this chapter, as defined in § 762.102, however, may be considered for two 5-year periods. The applicant must meet the definition of a beginning farmer and meet the other eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph (b) of this section at the onset of each 5-year period. A needs test will be completed in the fifth year of IA eligibility for beginning farmers, <PRTPAGE P="237"/>to determine continued eligibility for a second 5-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the limitation of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a new interest assistance agreement may be approved for eligible borrowers to provide interest assistance through June 8, 2009, provided the total period does not exceed 10 years from the effective date of the original interest assistance agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Multiple loans.</E> In the case of a borrower with multiple guaranteed loans with one lender, interest assistance can be applied to each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender selects, as necessary to achieve a feasible plan, subject to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Terms.</E> The typical term of scheduled loan repayment will not be reduced solely for the purpose of maximizing eligibility for interest assistance. A loan must be scheduled over the maximum term typically used by lenders for similar type loans within the limits in § 762.124. An OL for the purpose of providing annual operating and family living expenses will be scheduled for repayment when the income is scheduled to be received from the sale of the crops, livestock, and/or livestock products which will serve as security for the loan. An OL for purposes other than annual operating and family living expenses (i.e. purchase of equipment or livestock, or refinancing existing debt) will be scheduled over 7 years from the effective date of the proposed interest assistance agreement, or the life of the security, whichever is less.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Rate of interest.</E> The lender interest rate will be set according to § 762.124(a).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Agreement.</E> The lender and borrower must execute an interest assistance agreement as prescribed by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Interest assistance claims and payments.</E> To receive an interest assistance payment, the lender must prepare and submit a claim on the appropriate Agency form. The following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Interest assistance payments will be four (4) percent of the average daily principal loan balance prorated over the number of days the loan has been outstanding during the payment period. For loans with a note rate less than four (4) percent, interest assistance payments will be the weighted average interest rate multiplied by the average daily principal balance.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender may select at the time of loan closing the date that they wish to receive an interest assistance payment. That date will be included in the interest assistance agreement.</P>
              <P>(i) The initial and final claims submitted under an agreement may be for a period less than 12 months. All other claims will be submitted for a 12-month period, unless there is a lender substitution during the 12-month period in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the event of liquidation, the final interest assistance claim will be submitted with the estimated loss claim or the final loss claim if an estimated loss claim was not submitted. Interest will not be paid beyond the interest accrual cutoff dates established in the loss claims according to § 762.149(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) A claim should be filed within 60 days of its due date. Claims not filed within 1 year from the due date will not be paid, and the amount due the lender will be permanently forfeited.</P>
              <P>(4) All claims will be supported by detailed calculations of average daily principal balance during the claim period.</P>
              <P>(5) Requests for continuation of interest assistance for agreements dated prior to June 8, 2007 will be supported by the lender's analysis of the applicant's farming operation and need for continued interest assistance as set out in their Interest Assistance Agreements. The following information will be submitted to the Agency:</P>
              <P>(i) A summary of the operation's actual financial performance in the previous year, including a detailed income and expense statement.</P>
              <P>(ii) A narrative description of the causes of any major differences between the previous year's projections and actual performance, including a detailed income and expense statement.</P>
              <P>(iii) A current balance sheet.</P>

              <P>(iv) A cash-flow budget for the period being planned. A monthly cash-flow budget is required for all lines of credit <PRTPAGE P="238"/>and operating loans made for annual operating purposes. All other loans may include either an annual or monthly cash-flow budget.</P>
              <P>(v) A copy of the interest assistance needs analysis portion of the application form which has been completed based on the planned period's cash-flow budget.</P>
              <P>(6) Interest Assistance Agreements dated June 8, 2007 or later do not require a request for continuation of interest assistance. The lender will only be required to submit an Agency IA payment form and the average daily principal balance for the claim period, with supporting documentation.</P>
              <P>(7) Lenders may not charge or cause a borrower with an interest assistance agreement to be charged a fee for preparation and submission of the items required for an annual interest assistance claim.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Transfer, consolidation, and writedown.</E> Loans covered by interest assistance agreements cannot be consolidated. Such loans can be transferred only when the transferee was liable for the debt on the effective date of the interest assistance agreement. Loans covered by interest assistance can be transferred to an entity if the entity is eligible in accordance with §§ 762.120 and 762.150(b) and at least one entity member was liable for the debt on the effective date of the interest assistance agreement. Interest assistance will be discontinued as of the date of any writedown on a loan covered by an interest assistance agreement.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Rescheduling and deferral.</E> When a borrower defaults on a loan with interest assistance or the loan otherwise requires rescheduling or deferral, the interest assistance agreement will remain in effect for that loan at its existing terms. The lender may reschedule the loan in accordance with § 762.145. For Interest Assistance Agreements dated June 8, 2007 or later increases in the restructured loan amount above the amount originally obligated do not require additional funding; however, interest assistance is not available on that portion of the loan as interest assistance is limited to the original loan amount.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Bankruptcy.</E> In cases where the interest on a loan covered by an interest assistance agreement is reduced by court order in a reorganization plan under the bankruptcy code, interest assistance will be terminated effective on the date of the court order. Guaranteed loans which have had their interest reduced by bankruptcy court order are not eligible for interest assistance.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Termination of interest assistance payments.</E> Interest assistance payments will cease upon termination of the loan guarantee, upon reaching the expiration date contained in the agreement, or upon cancellation by the Agency under the terms of the interest assistance agreement. In addition, for loan guarantees sold into the secondary market, Agency purchase of the guaranteed portion of a loan will terminate the interest assistance.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Excessive interest assistance.</E> Upon written notice to the lender, borrower, and any holder, the Agency may amend or cancel the interest assistance agreement and collect from the lender any amount of interest assistance granted which resulted from incomplete or inaccurate information, an error in computation, or any other reason which resulted in payment that the lender was not entitled to receive.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Condition for cancellation.</E> The Interest Assistance Agreement is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation, of which the lender or borrower have actual knowledge at the time the interest assistance agreement is executed, or which the lender or borrower participates in or condones.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Substitution.</E> If there is a substitution of lender, the original lender will prepare and submit to the Agency a claim for its final interest assistance payment calculated through the effective date of the substitution. This final claim will be submitted for processing at the time of the substitution.</P>
              <P>(1) Interest assistance will continue automatically with the new lender.</P>
              <P>(2) The new lender must follow paragraph (i) of this section to receive their initial and subsequent interest assistance payments.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Exception Authority.</E> The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has the authority to grant an exception to any requirement involving interest assistance if it is in the best <PRTPAGE P="239"/>interest of the Government and is not inconsistent with other applicable law.</P>

              <P>A lender may pledge all or part of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion of the loan as security to a Federal Home Loan Bank, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Farm Credit System Bank, or any other funding source determined acceptable by the Agency.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 762.160</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Assignment of guarantee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The following general requirements apply to assigning guaranteed loans:</P>
              <P>(1) Subject to Agency concurrence, the lender may assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan to one or more holders at or after loan closing, if the loan is not in default. However, a line of credit cannot be assigned. The lender must always retain the unguaranteed portion in their portfolio, regardless of how the loan is funded.</P>
              <P>(2) The Agency may refuse to execute the Assignment of Guarantee and prohibit the assignment in case of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The Agency purchased and is holder of a loan that was assigned by the lender that is requesting the assignment.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lender has not complied with the reimbursement requirements of § 762.144(c)(7), except when the 180 day reimbursement or liquidation requirement has been waived by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(3) The lender will provide the Agency with copies of all appropriate forms used in the assignment.</P>
              <P>(4) The guaranteed portion of the loan may not be assigned by the lender until the loan has been fully disbursed to the borrower.</P>
              <P>(5) The lender is not permitted to assign any amount of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion of the loan to the applicant or borrower, or members of their immediate families, their officers, directors, stockholders, other owners, or any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate.</P>
              <P>(6) Upon the lender's assignment of the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender will remain bound to all obligations indicated in the Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, the Agency program regulations, and to future program regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the Lenders Agreement. The lender retains all rights under the security instruments for the protection of the lender and the United States.</P>

              <P>(2) The lender will send the holder the borrower's executed note attached to the Guarantee.</P>
              <P>(3) The holder, upon written notice to the lender and the Agency, may assign the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan. The holder must assign the guaranteed portion back to the original lender if requested for servicing or liquidation of the account.</P>
              <P>(4) The Guarantee or Assignment of Guarantee in the holder's possession does not cover:</P>
              <P>(i) Interest accruing 90 days after the holder has demanded repurchase by the lender, except as provided in the Assignment of Guarantee and § 762.144(c)(3)(iii).</P>
              <P>(ii) Interest accruing 90 days after the lender or the Agency has requested the holder to surrender evidence of debt repurchase, if the holder has not previously demanded repurchase.</P>
              <P>(c) Negotiations concerning premiums, fees, and additional payments for loans are to take place between the holder and the lender. The Agency will participate in such negotiations only as a provider of information.</P>

              <P>(b) With prior written approval from the Agency, the seller and buyer may modify the land contract provided that, in addition to a feasible plan for the upcoming operating cycle, a feasible plan can be reasonably projected throughout the remaining term of the guarantee.

              <P>(1) Must make a written demand on the buyer for payment of the defaulted amount within 30 days of the missed payment, taxes, or insurance and send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency and to the seller; and</P>
              <P>(2) Must make demand on the Agency within 90 days from the original payment, taxes, or insurance due date, for the missed payment in the event the buyer has not made the payment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard guarantee plan.</E> If the buyer fails to pay an annual amortized installment or a portion of an installment on the contract, then the seller has the option of either liquidating the real estate, or having the amount of the loss established by the Agency by an appraisal of the real estate. For either option, the servicing agent:</P>
              <P>(1) Must make a written demand on the buyer for payment of the defaulted amount within 30 days of the missed payment, and send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency and to the seller; and</P>
              <P>(2) Must immediately inform the Agency which option the seller has chosen for establishing the amount of the loss, in the event the buyer does not make the payment within 60 days of the demand letter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Liquidation method.</E> If the seller chooses the liquidation method, the servicing agent will:</P>
              <P>(A) Submit a liquidation plan to the Agency within 120 days from the missed payment for approval prior to any liquidation action. The Agency may require and pay for an appraisal prior to approval of the liquidation plan.</P>
              <P>(B) Complete liquidation within 12 months of the missed installment unless prevented by bankruptcy, redemption rights, or other legal action.</P>
              <P>(C) Credit an amount equal to the sale price received in a liquidation of the security property, with no deduction for expenses, to the principal balance of the land contract.</P>
              <P>(D) File a loss claim immediately after liquidation, which must include a complete loan ledger.</P>
              <P>(E) Base the loss claim amount on the appraisal method if the property is reacquired by the seller, through liquidation.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Appraisal method.</E> If the seller chooses to have the loss amount established by appraisal rather than liquidation, the Agency will complete an appraisal on the real estate, and the loss claim amount will be based on the difference between the appraised value at the time the loss is calculated and the unpaid principal balance of the land contract at that time.</P>
              <P>(A) The only administrative appeal allowed under § 761.6 of this chapter related to the resulting appraisal amount will be a determination of whether the appraisal is Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) compliant.</P>

              <P>(B) The seller will give the Agency a lien on the security property in the amount of the loss claim payment. If the property sells within 5 years from the date of the loss payment for an amount greater than the appraised value used to establish the loss claim amount, the seller must repay the difference, up to the amount of the loss claim. For purposes of determining the amount to be repaid (recapture), the market value of the property may be reduced by the value of certain capital <PRTPAGE P="247"/>improvements, as specified in § 766.202(a)(1)-(3) of this chapter, made by the seller to the property in the time period from the loss claim to final disposition. If the property is not sold within 5 years from the date of the loss payment, the Agency will release the lien and the seller will have no further obligation to the Agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishment of Federal debt and Agency recovery of loss claim payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any amount paid by FSA as a result of an approved loss claim is immediately due and payable by the buyer after FSA notifies the buyer that a loss claim has been paid to the seller. If the debt is not restructured into a repayment plan or the obligation otherwise cured, FSA may use all remedies available, including offset as authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the debt.</P>
              <P>(1) Interest on the debt will be at the FLP non-program real property loan rate in effect at the time of the first Agency payment of a loss claim.</P>
              <P>(2) The debt may be scheduled for repayment consistent with the buyer's repayment ability, not to exceed 7 years. Before any payment plan can be approved, the buyer must provide the Agency with the best lien obtainable on all of the buyer's assets. This includes the buyer's ownership interest in the real estate under contract for guarantees using the prompt payment guarantee plan. When the buyer is an entity, the best lien obtainable will be taken on all of the entity's assets, and all assets owned by individual members of the entity, including their ownership interest in the real estate under contract.</P>
              <P>(b) Annually, buyers with an Agency approved repayment plan under this section will supply the Agency a current balance sheet, income statement, cash flow budget, complete copy of Federal income tax returns, and any additional information needed to analyze the buyer's financial condition.</P>
              <P>(c) If a buyer fails to make required payments to the Agency as specified in the approved repayment plan, the debt will be treated as a non-program loan debt, and servicing will proceed as specified in § 766.351(c) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) The guarantee and the Agency's obligations will terminate at the earliest of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) Full payment of the land contract;</P>
              <P>(2) Agency payment to the seller of 3 annual installments plus property taxes and insurance, if applicable, under the prompt payment guarantee plan, if not repaid in full by the buyer. An Agency approved repayment plan will not constitute payment in full until such time as the entire amount due for the Agency approved repayment plan is paid in full;</P>
              <P>(3) Payment of a loss claim through the standard guarantee plan;</P>
              <P>(4) Sale of real estate without guarantee being properly assigned;</P>
              <P>(5) The seller terminates the land contract for reasons other than monetary default; or</P>
              <P>(6) If for any reason the land contract becomes null and void.</P>
              <P>(b) If none of the events in paragraph (a) of this section occur, the guarantee will automatically expire, without notice, 10 years from the effective date of the guarantee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Loan application.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A loan application must be submitted in the name of the actual operator of the farm. Two or more applicants applying jointly will be considered an entity applicant. The Agency will consider tax filing status and other business dealings as indicators of the operator of the farm.</P>
                <P>(b) A complete loan application, except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, will include:</P>
                <P>(1) The completed Agency application form;</P>
                <P>(2) If the applicant is an entity:</P>
                <P>(i) A complete list of entity members showing the address, citizenship, principal occupation, and the number of shares and percentage of ownership or stock held in the entity by each member, or the percentage of interest in the entity held by each member;</P>
                <P>(ii) A current financial statement from each member of the entity;</P>
                <P>(iii) A current financial statement from the entity itself;</P>
                <P>(iv) A copy of the entity's charter or any entity agreement, any articles of incorporation and bylaws, any certificate or evidence of current registration (good standing), and a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors or entity members authorizing specified officers of the entity to apply for and obtain the desired loan and execute required debt, security and other loan instruments and agreements;</P>
                <P>(v) In the form of married couples applying as a joint operation, items (i) and (iv) will not be required. The Agency may request copies of the marriage license, prenuptial agreement or similar documents as needed to verify loan eligibility and security.

                <SUBJECT>General eligibility requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following requirements must be met unless otherwise provided in the eligibility requirements for the particular type of loan.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Controlled substances.</E> The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must not be ineligible for loans as a result of a conviction for controlled substances according to 7 CFR part 718 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Legal capacity.</E> The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must possess the legal capacity to incur the obligation of the loan. A Youth loan applicant will incur full personal liability upon execution of the promissory note without regard to the applicant's minority status.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Citizenship.</E> The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must be a citizen of the United States, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien under applicable Federal immigration laws.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Credit history.</E> The applicant must have acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt repayment.</P>

                <P>(1) As part of the credit history, the Agency will determine whether the applicant will carry out the terms and <PRTPAGE P="252"/>conditions of the loan and deal with the Agency in good faith. In making this determination, the Agency may examine whether the applicant has properly fulfilled its obligations to other parties, including other agencies of the Federal Government.</P>
                <P>(2) When the applicant caused the Agency a loss by receiving debt forgiveness, the applicant may be ineligible for assistance in accordance with eligibility requirements for the specific loan type. If the debt forgiveness is cured by repayment of the Agency's loss, the Agency may still consider the debt forgiveness in determining the applicant's credit worthiness.</P>
                <P>(3) A history of failures to repay past debts as they came due when the ability to repay was within the applicant's control will demonstrate unacceptable credit history. The following circumstances, for example, do not automatically indicate an unacceptable credit history:</P>
                <P>(i) Foreclosures, judgments, delinquent payments of the applicant which occurred more than 36 months before the application, if no recent similar situations have occurred, or Agency delinquencies that have been resolved through loan servicing programs available under 7 CFR part 766.</P>
                <P>(ii) Isolated incidents of delinquent payments which do not represent a general pattern of unsatisfactory or slow payment.</P>
                <P>(iii) “No history” of credit transactions by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(iv) Recent foreclosure, judgment, bankruptcy, or delinquent payment when the applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate that the adverse action or delinquency was caused by circumstances that were of a temporary nature and beyond the applicant's control; or the result of a refusal to make full payment because of defective goods or services or other justifiable dispute relating to the purchase or contract for goods or services.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Availability of credit elsewhere.</E> Except for CL, the applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, must be unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance actual needs at reasonable rates and terms. The Agency will evaluate the ability to obtain credit based on factors including, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Loan amounts, rates, and terms available in the marketplace; and</P>
                <P>(2) Property interests, income, and significant non-essential assets.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Not in delinquent status on Federal debt.</E> As provided in 31 CFR part 285, except for EM loan applicants, the applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must not be in delinquent status on any Federal debt, other than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at the time of loan closing. All delinquent debts, however, will be considered in determining credit history and ability to repay under this part.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Outstanding judgments.</E> The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must have no outstanding unpaid judgments obtained by the United States in any court. Such judgments do not include those filed as a result of action in the United States Tax Courts.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Federal crop insurance violation.</E> The applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, must not be ineligible due to disqualification resulting from Federal crop insurance violation according to 7 CFR part 718.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Managerial ability.</E> The applicant must have sufficient managerial ability to assure reasonable prospects of loan repayment, as determined by the Agency. The applicant must demonstrate this managerial ability by:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Education.</E> For example, the applicant obtained a 4-year college degree in agricultural business, horticulture, animal science, agronomy, or other agricultural-related field.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">On-the-job training.</E> For example, the applicant is currently working on a farm as part of an apprenticeship program.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Farming experience.</E> For example, the applicant has been an owner, manager, or operator of a farm business for at least one entire production cycle or for MLs, made for OL purposes, the applicant may have obtained and successfully repaid one FSA Youth-OL. Farm experience of the applicant, without regard to any lapse of time between the farm experience and the new application, will be taken into consideration in determining loan eligibility. If farm <PRTPAGE P="253"/>experience occurred more than 5 years prior to the date of the new application, the applicant must demonstrate sufficient on-the-job training or education within the last 5 years to demonstrate managerial ability.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Alternatives for MLs made for OL purposes.</E> Applicants for MLs made for OL purposes, also may demonstrate managerial ability by one of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Certification of a past participation with an agriculture-related organization, such as, but not limited to, 4-H Club, FFA, beginning farmer and rancher development programs, or Community Based Organizations, that demonstrates experience in a related agricultural enterprise; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A written description of a self-directed apprenticeship combined with either prior sufficient experience working on a farm or significant small business management experience. As a condition of receiving the loan, the self-directed apprenticeship requires that the applicant seek, receive, and apply guidance from a qualified person during the first cycle of production and marketing typical for the applicant's specific operation. The individual providing the guidance must be knowledgeable in production, management, and marketing practices that are pertinent to the applicant's operation, and agree to form a developmental partnership with the applicant to share knowledge, skills, information, and perspective of agriculture to foster the applicant's development of technical skills and management ability.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Borrower training.</E> The applicant must agree to meet the training requirements in subpart K of this part.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Operator of a family farm.</E> Except for CL:</P>
                <P>(1) The applicant must be the operator of a family farm after the loan is closed.</P>
                <P>(2) For an entity applicant, if the entity members holding a majority interest are:</P>
                <P>(i) Related by blood or marriage, at least one member must be the operator of a family farm;</P>
                <P>(ii) Not related by blood or marriage, the entity members holding a majority interest must be operators of a family farm.</P>
                <P>(3) Except for EM loans, the collective interests of the members may be larger than a family farm only if:</P>
                <P>(i) Each member's ownership interest is not larger than a family farm;</P>
                <P>(ii) All of the members of the entity are related by blood or marriage; and</P>
                <P>(iii) All of the members are or will become operators of the family farm; and</P>
                <P>(4) If the entity applicant has an operator and ownership interest for farm ownership loans and emergency loans for farm ownership loan purposes, in any other farming operation, that farming operation must not exceed the requirements of a family farm.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Entity composition.</E> If the applicant has one or more embedded entities, at least 75 percent of the individual ownnership interests of each embedded entity must be owned by members actively involved in managing or operating the family farm.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Eligibility requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The applicant:</P>
                <P>(a) Must comply with the general eligibility requirements established at § 764.101;</P>
                <P>(b) Must be an established farmer;</P>
                <P>(c) Must be the owner-operator or tenant-operator as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For a loan made under § 764.351(a)(1), must have been:</P>
                <P>(i) The owner-operator of the farm at the time of the disaster; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The tenant-operator of the farm at the time of the disaster whose lease on the affected real estate exceeds the term of the loan. The operator will provide prior notification to the Agency if the lease is proposed to terminate during the term of the loan. The lessor will provide the Agency a mortgage on the real estate as security for the loan;</P>

                <P>(2) For a loan made under § 764.351(a) (2) or (b), must have been the operator <PRTPAGE P="264"/>of the farm at the time of the disaster; and</P>
                <P>(3) In the case of an entity, the entity must be:</P>
                <P>(i) Engaged primarily and directly in farming in the United States;</P>
                <P>(ii) Authorized to operate and own the farm, if the funds are used for farm ownership loan purposes, in the State in which the farm is located;</P>
                <P>(d) Must demonstrate the intent to continue the farming operation after the designated or declared disaster;</P>
                <P>(e) And all entity members must be unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms. To establish this, the applicant must obtain written declinations of credit, specifying the reasons for declination, from legally organized commercial lending institutions within reasonable proximity of the applicant as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) In the case of a loan in excess of $300,000, two written declinations of credit are required;</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of a loan of $300,000 or less, one written declination of credit is required; and</P>
                <P>(3) In the case of a loan of $100,000 or less, the Agency may waive the requirement for obtaining a written declination of credit, if the Agency determines that it would pose an undue burden on the applicant, the applicant certifies that they cannot get credit elsewhere, and based on the applicant's circumstances credit is not likely to be available;</P>
                <P>(4) Notwithstanding the applicant's submission of the required written declinations of credit, the Agency may contact other commercial lending institutions within reasonable proximity of the applicant and make an independent determination of the applicant's ability to obtain credit elsewhere;</P>
                <P>(f) And all entity members in the case of an entity, must not have received debt forgiveness from the Agency on more than one occasion on or before April 4, 1996, or any time after April 4, 1996.</P>
                <P>(g) Must submit an application to be received by the Agency no later than 8 months after the date the disaster is declared or designated in the county of the applicant's operation.</P>
                <P>(h) For production loss loans, must have a disaster yield that is at least 30 percent below the normal production yield of the crop, as determined by the Agency, which comprises a basic part of an applicant's total farming operation.</P>
                <P>(i) For physical loss loans, must have suffered disaster-related damage to chattel or real estate essential to the farming operation, or to household contents that must be repaired or replaced, to harvested or stored crops, or to perennial crops.</P>
                <P>(j) Must meet all of the following requirements if the ownership structure of the family farm changes between the time of a qualifying loss and the time an EM loan is closed:</P>
                <P>(1) The applicant, including all owners must meet all of the eligibility requirements;</P>
                <P>(2) The individual applicant, or all owners of a entity applicant, must have had an ownership interest in the farming operation at the time of the disaster; and</P>
                <P>(3) The amount of the loan will be based on the percentage of the former farming operation transferred to the applicant and in no event will the individual portions aggregated equal more than would have been authorized for the former farming operation.</P>
                <P>(k) Must agree to repay any duplicative Federal assistance to the agency providing such assistance. An applicant receiving Federal assistance for a major disaster or emergency is liable to the United States to the extent that the assistance duplicates benefits available to the applicant for the same purpose from another source.</P>
                <P>(l) Whose primary enterprise is to breed, raise, and sell horses may be eligible under this part.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(2) In the case of a physical loss loan, the total eligible physical losses caused by the disaster; or</P>
                <P>(3) In the case of a production loss loan, 100 percent of the total actual production loss sustained by the applicant as calculated in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) For production loss loans, the applicant's actual crop production loss will be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Subtract the disaster yield from the normal yield to determine the per acre production loss;</P>
                <P>(2) Multiply the per acre production loss by the number of acres of the farming operation devoted to the crop to determine the volume of the production loss;</P>
                <P>(3) Multiply the volume of the production loss by the market price for such crop as determined by the Agency to determine the dollar value for the production loss; and</P>
                <P>(4) Subtract any other disaster related compensation or insurance indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the production loss.</P>
                <P>(d) For a physical loss loan, the applicant's total eligible physical losses will be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Add the allowable costs associated with replacing or repairing chattel covered by hazard insurance (excluding labor, machinery, equipment, or materials contributed by the applicant to repair or replace chattel);</P>
                <P>(2) Add the allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing real estate, covered by hazard insurance;</P>
                <P>(3) Add the value of replacement livestock and livestock products for which the applicant provided:</P>
                <P>(i) Written documentation of inventory on hand immediately preceding the loss;</P>
                <P>(ii) Records of livestock product sales sufficient to allow the Agency to establish a value;</P>
                <P>(4) Add the allowable costs to restore perennials to the stage of development the damaged perennials had obtained prior to the disaster;</P>
                <P>(5) Add, in the case of an individual applicant, the allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing household contents, not to exceed $20,000; and</P>
                <P>(6) Subtract any other disaster related compensation or insurance indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the loss or damage to the chattel or real estate.</P>
                <P>(e) EM loan funds may not be used for physical loss purposes unless:</P>
                <P>(1) The physical property was covered by general hazard insurance at the time that the damage caused by the natural disaster occurred. The level of the coverage in effect at the time of the disaster must have been the tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is less. Chattel property must have been covered at the tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is less, when such insurance was readily available and the benefit of the coverage was greater than the cost of the insurance; or</P>
                <P>(2) The loan is to a poultry farmer to cover the loss of a chicken house for which the applicant did not have hazard insurance at the time of the loss and the applicant:</P>
                <P>(i) Applied for, but was unable to obtain hazard insurance for the chicken house;</P>
                <P>(ii) Uses the loan to rebuild the chicken house in accordance with industry standards in effect on the date the applicant submits an application for the loan;</P>
                <P>(iii) Obtains, for the term of the loan, hazard insurance for the full market value of the chicken house; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Meets all other requirements for the loan.</P>
                <P>(f) EM loan funds may not be used to refinance consumer debt, such as automobile loans, or credit card debt unless such credit card debt is directly attributable to the farming operation.</P>
                <P>(g) Losses associated with horses used for racing, showing, recreation, or pleasure or loss of income derived from racing, showing, recreation, boarding, or pleasure are not considered qualified losses under this section.</P>

                <P>(b) EM loans made as specified in § 764.351(a)(2) and (b) must generally comply with the general security requirements established in §§ 764.103, 764.104, and 764.255(b). These general security requirements, however, do not apply to equine loss loans to the extent that a lien is not obtainable or obtaining a lien may prevent the applicant from carrying on the normal course of business. Other security may be considered for an equine loss loan in the order of priority as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Real estate,</P>
                <P>(2) Chattels and crops, other than horses,</P>

                <P>(1) The applicant has pledged as security for the loan all available personal and business security, except as provided in § 764.106;</P>
                <P>(2) The farm operating plan, approved by the Agency, indicates the loan will be repaid based upon the applicant's production and income history; addresses applicable pricing risks through the use of marketing contracts, hedging, options, or other revenue protection mechanisms, and includes a marketing plan or similar risk management practice;</P>
                <P>(3) The applicant has had positive net cash farm income in at least 3 of the past 5 years; and</P>
                <P>(4) The applicant has provided the Agency an assignment on any USDA program payments to be received.</P>
                <P>(d) For loans over $25,000, title clearance is required when real estate is taken as security.</P>
                <P>(e) For loans of $25,000 or less, when real estate is taken as security, a certification of ownership in real estate is required. Certification of ownership may be in the form of an affidavit which is signed by the applicant, names the record owner of the real estate in question and lists the balances due on all known debts against the real estate. Whenever the Agency is uncertain of the record owner or debts against the real estate security, a title search is required.</P>

                <P>(a) A borrower with limited resource interest rate loans is required to provide the Agency annually the operation's financial information to determine if the borrower can afford to pay a higher interest rate on the loan. The Agency will review the information provided in accordance with § 761.105 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(b) If the borrower's farm operating plan shows that the debt service margin exceeds 110 percent, the Agency will increase the interest rate on the loans with a limited resource interest rate until:</P>
                <P>(1) A further increase in the interest rate results in a debt service margin of less than 110 percent; or</P>
                <P>(2) The interest rate is equal to the interest rate currently in effect for the type of loan.</P>
                <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Agency will increase the limited resource interest rate to the current interest rate for the type of loan, if the borrower:</P>
                <P>(1) Purchases items not planned during the term of the loan;</P>
                <P>(2) Refuses to submit information the Agency requests for use in reviewing the borrower's financial condition;</P>
                <P>(3) Ceases farming, as described in § 765.253; or</P>
                <P>(4) Is ineligible due to disqualification resulting from Federal crop insurance violation according to 7 CFR part 718.</P>
                <P>(d) If the borrower has limited resource interest rate loans that are deferred, the Agency will not change the interest rate during the deferral period.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Borrower graduation requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In accordance with the promissory note and security instruments, the borrower must graduate to another source of credit if the Agency determines that:</P>
                <P>(1) The borrower has the ability to obtain credit from other sources; and</P>
                <P>(2) Adequate credit is available from other sources at reasonable rates and terms.</P>
                <P>(b) The Agency may require partial or full graduation.</P>
                <P>(1) In a partial graduation, all FLP loans of one type (i.e. all chattel loans or all real estate loans) must be paid in full by refinancing with other credit with or without an Agency guarantee.</P>
                <P>(2) In a full graduation, all FLP loans are paid in full by refinancing with other credit with or without an Agency guarantee.</P>
                <P>(3) A loan made for chattel and real estate purposes will be categorized according to how the majority of the loan's funds are expended.</P>
                <P>(c) The borrower must submit all information that the Agency requests in conjunction with the review of the borrower's financial condition.</P>

                <P>(d) The Agency may provide a borrower's prospectus to lenders in an attempt to identify sources of non-Agency credit and assess the lenders' interest in refinancing the borrower's loan. <PRTPAGE P="274"/>The Agency will notify the borrower when the borrower's prospectus is provided to one or more lenders.</P>
                <P>(e) If a lender expresses an interest in refinancing the borrower's FLP loan, the borrower must:</P>
                <P>(1) Apply for a loan from the interested lender within 30 days of notice; or</P>
                <P>(2) Seek guaranteed loan assistance under the market placement program in accordance with § 762.110(g) of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(f) The borrower will be responsible for any application fees or purchase of stock in conjunction with graduation.</P>
                <P>(g) CLs are not subject to graduation requirements under this part.</P>

                <P>(3) The Agency will return the paid note and satisfied security instruments to the borrower after the Agency processes the final payment and determines that the total indebtedness is paid in full.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Borrower refunds.</E> If the borrower refunds the entire loan after the loan is closed, the borrower must pay interest from the date of the note to the date the Agency received the funds.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> If an Agency miscalculation of a final payment results in an overpayment by the borrower of less than $10, the borrower must request a refund from the Agency in writing. Overpayments of $10 or more automatically will be refunded by the Agency.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Underpayments.</E> If an Agency miscalculation of a final payment amount results in an underpayment, the Agency may collect all account balances resulting from its error. If the Agency cannot collect an underpayment from the borrower, the Agency will attempt to settle the debt in accordance with subpart B of 7 CFR part 1956.</P>

                <P>(xiv) Any planned development of real estate security will be performed as directed by the lessor or creditor, as approved by the Agency, and will comply with the terms and conditions of § 761.10 of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(xv) If a borrower with an SAA mortgage is refinancing a loan held by a lender, subordination of the SAA mortgage may only be approved when the refinanced loan does not increase the amount of debt; and</P>
                <P>(xvi) In the case of a subordination of non-program loan security, the non-program loan security also secures a program loan with the same borrower.</P>
                <P>(4) The Agency will approve a request for subordination of real estate to a lessee if the conditions in paragraphs (b)(3)(viii) through (xvi) of this section are met.</P>

                <P>(b) A family member of the borrower or an entity comprised solely of family members of the borrower assumes the debt along with the original borrower;</P>
                <P>(c) An individual with an ownership interest in the borrower entity buys the entire ownership interest of the other members and continues to operate the farm in accordance with loan requirements. The new owner must assume personal liability for the loan;</P>
                <P>(d) A new entity buys the borrower entity and continues to operate the farm in accordance with loan requirements; or</P>
                <P>(e) The original loan is an EM loan for physical or production losses and persons who were directly involved in the farm's operation at the time of the loss will assume the loan. If the original loan was made to:</P>
                <P>(1) An individual borrower, the transferee must be a family member of the original borrower or an entity in which the entity members are comprised solely of family members of the original borrower.</P>
                <P>(2) A trust, partnership or joint operation, the transferee must have been a member, partner or joint operator when the Agency made the original loan or remain an entity comprised solely of people who were original entity members, partners or joint operators when the entity received the original loan.</P>
                <P>(3) A corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, or other legal business organization, the transferee must:</P>

                <P>(ii) Assume only the portion of the physical or production loss loan equal to the transferee's percentage of ownership. In the case of entity transferees, the transferee must assume that portion of the loan equal to the combined percentages of ownership of the individual stockholders or entity members in the transferee.</P>

                <P>(4) As a direct result of the natural disaster, the borrower does not have sufficient income available to pay all family living and farm operating expenses, other creditors, and debts to the Agency. This determination will be based on:</P>

                <P>(ii) Any other records required by the Agency;</P>
                <P>(iii) Compensation received for losses; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Increased expenses incurred because of the natural disaster.</P>
                <P>(5) For the next production cycle, the borrower must develop a feasible plan showing that the borrower will at least be able to pay all operating expenses and taxes due during the year, essential family living expenses, and meet scheduled payments on all debts, including FLP debts. The borrower must provide any documentation required to support the farm operating plan.</P>
                <P>(6) The borrower must not be in non-monetary default.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan eligibility.</E> (1) Any FLP loan to be considered for DSA must have been outstanding at the time the natural disaster occurred.<PRTPAGE P="289"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) All of the borrower's program and non-program loans must be current after the Agency completes a DSA of the scheduled installment.</P>
                <P>(3) All FLP loans must be current or less than 90 days past due at the time the application for DSA is complete.</P>
                <P>(4) The Agency has not accelerated or applied any special servicing action under this part to the loan since the natural disaster occurred.</P>
                <P>(5) For any loan that will receive a DSA, the remaining term of the loan must equal or exceed 2 years from the due date of the installment set-aside.</P>
                <P>(6) The loan must not have a DSA in place.</P>

                <P>(2) The amount the borrower is unable to pay the Agency due to the disaster. Borrowers are required to pay any portion of an installment they are able to pay.</P>
                <P>(b) The amount set aside will be the unpaid balance remaining on the installment at the time the DSA is complete. This amount will include the unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment were paid on the due date, taking into consideration any payments applied to principal and interest since the due date.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A debtor with only SA or Non-program loans is not eligible for a Conservation Contract. However, an SA or Non-program loan may be considered for a Conservation Contract if the borrower also has program loans.</P>
                <P>(2) A current or financially distressed borrower may request a Conservation Contract at any time prior to becoming 90 days past due.</P>
                <P>(3) A delinquent borrower may request a Conservation Contract during the same 60-day time period in which the borrower may apply for primary loan servicing. The borrower eligibility requirements in § 766.104 will apply.</P>
                <P>(4) A Conservation Contract may be established for conservation, recreation, and wildlife purposes.</P>
                <P>(5) The land under a Conservation Contract cannot be used for the production of agricultural commodities during the term of the contract.</P>
                <P>(6) Only loans secured by the real estate that will be subject to the Conservation Contract may be considered for debt reduction under this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible lands.</E> The following types of lands are eligible to be considered for a Conservation Contract by the Conservation Contract review team:</P>
                <P>(1) Wetlands or highly erodible lands; and</P>
                <P>(2) Uplands that meet any one of the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(i) Land containing aquatic life, endangered species, or wildlife habitat of local, State, tribal, or national importance;</P>

                <P>(vii) Areas that contain soils generally not suited for cultivation; or</P>
                <P>(viii) Areas within or adjacent to Federal, State, tribal, or locally administered conservation areas.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Unsuitable acreage.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, acreage is unsuitable for a Conservation Contract if:</P>

                <P>(2) It has on-site or off-site conditions that prohibit the use of the land <PRTPAGE P="297"/>for conservation, wildlife, or recreational purposes; or</P>
                <P>(3) The Conservation Contract review team determines that the land is not suitable for conservation, wildlife, or recreational purposes.</P>
                <P>(3) The Conservation Contract review team determines that the land does not provide measurable conservation, wildlife, or recreational benefits;</P>
                <P>(4) There would be a duplication of benefits as determined by the Conservation Contract review team because the acreage is encumbered under another Federal, State, or local government program for which the borrower has been or is being compensated for conservation, wildlife, or recreation benefits;</P>
                <P>(5) The acreage subject to the proposed Conservation Contract is encumbered under a Federal, State, or local government cost share program that is inconsistent with the purposes of the proposed Conservation Contract, or the required practices of the cost share program are not identified in the conservation management plan;</P>
                <P>(6) The tract does not contain a legal right of way or other permanent access for the term of the contract that can be used by the Agency or its designee to carry out the contract; or</P>

                <P>(f) <E T="03">Management authority.</E> The Agency has enforcement authority over the Conservation Contract. The Agency, however, may delegate contract management to another entity if doing so is in the Agency's best interest.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> The Conservation Contract must meet the following conditions:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Determining the shared appreciation due.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The value of the real estate security at the time of maturity of the SAA (market value) will be the appraised value of the security at the highest and best use, less the increase in the value of the security resulting from capital improvements added during the term of the SAA (contributory value). The market value of the real estate security property will be determined based on a current appraisal completed within the previous 12 months in accordance with § 761.7 of this chapter, and subject to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Prior to completion of the appraisal, the borrower will identify any capital improvements that have been added to the real estate security since the execution of the SAA.</P>
                <P>(2) The appraisal must specifically identify the contributory value of capital improvements made to the real estate security during the term of the SAA to make deductions for that value.</P>
                <P>(3) For calculation of shared appreciation recapture, the contributory value of capital improvements added during the term of the SAA will be deducted from the market value of the property. Such capital improvements must also meet at least one of the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(i) It is the borrower's primary residence. If the new residence is affixed to the real estate security as a replacement for a residence which existed on the security property when the SAA was originally executed, or, the living area square footage of the original residence was expanded, only the value added to the real property by the new or expanded portion of the original residence (if it added value) will be deducted from the market value.</P>
                <P>(ii) It is an improvement to the real estate with a useful life of over one year and is affixed to the property, the following conditions must be met:</P>

                <P>(A) The item must have been capitalized and not taken as an annual operating expense on the borrower's Federal income tax returns. The borrower <PRTPAGE P="333"/>must provide copies of appropriate tax returns to verify that capital improvements claimed for shared appreciation recapture reduction are capitalized.</P>
                <P>(B) If the new item is affixed to the real estate as a replacement for an item that existed on the real estate at the time the SAA was originally executed, only the value added by the new item will be deducted from the market value.</P>
                <P>(b) In the event of a partial sale, an appraisal of the property being sold may be required to determine the market value at the time the SAA was signed if such value cannot be obtained through another method.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Acceleration and foreclosure moratorium.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, borrowers who file or have filed a program discrimination complaint that is accepted by USDA Office of Adjudication or successor office (USDA), and have been serviced to the point of acceleration or <PRTPAGE P="340"/>foreclosure on or after May 22, 2008, will not have their account accelerated or liquidated until such complaint has been resolved by USDA or closed by a court of competent jurisdiction. This moratorium applies only to program loans made under subtitle A, B, or C of the Act (for example, CL, FO, OL, EM, SW, or RL). Interest will not accrue and no offsets will be taken on these loans during the moratorium. Interest accrual and offsets will continue on all other loans, including, but not limited to, non-program loans.</P>
                <P>(1) If the Agency prevails on the program discrimination complaint, the interest that would have accrued during the moratorium will be reinstated on the account when the moratorium terminates, and all offsets and servicing actions will resume.</P>
                <P>(2) If the borrower prevails on the program discrimination complaint, the interest that would have accrued during the moratorium will not be reinstated on the account unless specifically required by the settlement agreement or court order.</P>
                <P>(b) The moratorium will begin on:</P>
                <P>(1) May 22, 2008, if the borrower had a pending program discrimination claim that was accepted by USDA as valid and the account was at the point of acceleration or foreclosure on or before that date; or</P>
                <P>(2) The date after May 22, 2008, when the borrower has a program discrimination claim accepted by USDA as valid and the borrower's account is at the point of acceleration or foreclosure.</P>
                <P>(c) The point of acceleration under this section is the earliest of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The day after all rights offered on the Agency notice of intent to accelerate expire if the borrower does not appeal;</P>
                <P>(2) The day after all appeals resulting from an Agency notice of intent to accelerate are concluded if the borrower appeals and the Agency prevails on the appeal;</P>
                <P>(3) The day after all appeal rights have been concluded relating to a failure to graduate and the Agency prevails on any appeal;</P>
                <P>(4) Any other time when, because of litigation, third party action, or other unforeseen circumstance, acceleration is the next step for the Agency in servicing and liquidating the account.</P>
                <P>(d) A borrower is considered to be in foreclosure status under this section anytime after acceleration of the account.</P>
                <P>(e) The moratorium will end on the earlier of:</P>
                <P>(1) The date the program discrimination claim is resolved by USDA or</P>
                <P>(2) The date that a court of competent jurisdiction renders a final decision on the program discrimination claim if the borrower appeals the decision of USDA.</P>

              <P>(a) Loans made by the Agency to the intermediary lender will bear interest at a fixed rate as determined by the Administrator, but not less than 1 percent per year over the term of the loan.</P>
              <P>(1) Interest rates charged by intermediary lender to ultimate recipients on loans from the HFIL revolving fund will be negotiated between the intermediary lender and ultimate recipient, but the rate must be within limits established by the Intermediary Relending Agreement.</P>

The intermediary is responsible to make loans to ultimate recipients in such a manner that will fully protect the interest of the intermediary and the Government. The Agency will require adequate security, as determined by the Agency, to fully secure the loan, including but not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Assignments of assessments, taxes, levies, or other sources of revenue as authorized by law;</P>
              <P>(2) Investments and deposits of the intermediary; and</P>
              <P>(3) Capital assets or other property of the intermediary and its members.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Liens.</E> In addition to normal security documents, a first lien interest in the intermediary's revolving fund account will be accomplished by a control agreement satisfactory to the Agency. The control agreement does not require the Agency's signature for withdrawals. The depository bank must waive its offset and recoupment rights against the depository account to the Agency and subordinate any liens it may have against the HFIL depository bank account.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ultimate recipient.</E> Security for a loan from an intermediary lender's HFIL revolving fund to an ultimate recipient will be adequate to fully secure the loan as specified in the relending agreement.</P>
              <P>(1) The Agency will only require concurrence in the intermediary lender's security requirement for a specific loan when security for the loan from the intermediary lender to the ultimate recipient will also serve as security for an Agency loan.</P>
              <P>(2) The ultimate recipient will take appropriate action to obtain and provide security for the loan.</P>

              <P>(2) An intermediary lender may use revolving funds and HFIL loan funds to make loans to ultimate recipients without obtaining prior Agency concurrence in accordance with the Intermediary Relending Agreement;</P>
              <P>(3) Any funds in the HFIL revolving fund from any source that is not needed for debt service, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to ultimate recipients;</P>
              <P>(4) All reserves and other funds in the HFIL revolving loan fund not immediately needed for loans to ultimate recipients or other authorized uses must be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and will be interest bearing. Any interest earned thereon remains a part of the HFIL revolving fund;</P>
              <P>(5) If an intermediary lender receives more than one HFIL loan, it does not need to establish and maintain a separate HFIL revolving loan fund for each loan; it may combine them and maintain only one HFIL revolving fund, unless the Agency requires separate HFIL revolving funds because there are significant differences in the loan purposes, Intermediary Relending Agreement, loan agreements, or requirements for the loans; and</P>
              <P>(6) A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be used to create a reserve for bad debts. Reserves should be accumulated over a period of years. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected losses, considering the quality of the intermediary lender's portfolio of loans. Unless the intermediary lender provides loss and delinquency records that, in the opinion of the Agency, justifies different amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans must be accumulated over 5 years and then maintained.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan monitoring reviews.</E> The intermediary lender must complete loan monitoring reviews, including annual and periodic reviews, and performance monitoring.</P>
              <P>(1) At least annually, the intermediary lender must provide the Agency documents for the purpose of reviewing the financial status of the intermediary Lender, assessing the progress of utilizing loan funds, and identifying any potential problems or concerns. Non-regulated intermediary lenders must furnish audited financial statements at least annually.</P>
              <P>(2) At any time the Agency determines it is necessary, the intermediary lender must allow the Agency or its representative to review the operations and financial condition of the intermediary lender. Upon the Agency requests, the Intermediary must submit financial or other information within 14 days unless the data requested is not available within that time frame.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Progress reports.</E> Each intermediary lender will be monitored by the Agency based on progress reports submitted by the intermediary lender, audit findings, disbursement transactions, visitations, and other contact with the intermediary lender as necessary.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) The restructuring will be performed within the Agency's budget authority; and</P>
              <P>(3) The loan objectives cannot be met unless the HFIL loan is restructured.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Default.</E> In the event of monetary or non-monetary default, the Agency will take all appropriate actions to protect its interest, including, but not limited to, declaring the debt fully due and payable and may proceed to enforce its rights under the loan agreement or any other loan instruments relating to the loan under applicable law and regulations, and commencement of legal action to protect the Agency's interest. The Agency will work with the intermediary lender to correct any default, subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Violation of any agreement with the Agency or failure to comply with reporting or other program requirements will be considered non-monetary default.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reviews.</E> In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Agency will conduct a compliance review of all Minor Program borrowers, to determine if a borrower has directly, or through contractual or other arrangement, subjected any person or caused any person to be subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Security inspection.</E> The Agency will inspect real estate that is security for a Minor Program loan at least once every 3 years, and chattel security at least annually. More frequent security inspections may be made as determined necessary by the Agency. Borrowers will allow representatives of the Agency, or any agency of the U.S. Government, in accordance with statutes and regulations, such access to the security property as the agency determines is necessary to document compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Violations.</E> If the Agency determines that the borrower has failed to adequately maintain security, made unapproved dispositions of security, or otherwise has placed the repayment of the Minor Program loan in jeopardy, the Agency will:</P>
              <P>(1) For chattel security, service the account according to part 765 of this chapter. If any normal income security as defined in that subpart secures a Minor Program loan, the reporting, approval and release provisions in that subpart shall apply.</P>
              <P>(2) For real estate security for AMP loans, contact the Regional Office of General Counsel for advice on the appropriate servicing including liquidation if warranted.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> The Agency shall grant a subordination of Minor Program loan security when the transaction will further the purposes for which the loan was made, and all of the following are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The loan will still be adequately secured after the subordination, or the value of the loan security will be increased by the amount of advances to be made under the terms of the subordination.</P>
              <P>(2) The borrower can document the ability to pay all debts including the new loan.</P>
              <P>(3) The action does not change the nature of the borrower's activities to the extent that they would no longer be eligible for a Minor Program loan.</P>
              <P>(4) The subordination is for a specific amount.</P>
              <P>(5) The borrower is unable, as determined by the Agency, to refinance its loan and graduate in accordance with this subpart.</P>

The borrower will be ineligible for a subordination for the crop year in which the conviction occurred and the four succeeding crop years. An applicant must attest on the Agency application form that it, and its members if an entity, have not been convicted of such a crime.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application.</E> To request a subordination, a Minor Program borrower <PRTPAGE P="362"/>must make the request in writing and provide the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The specific amount of debt for which a subordination is needed;</P>
              <P>(2) An appraisal prepared in accordance with § 761.7 of this chapter, if the request is for a subordination of more than $10,000, unless a sufficient appraisal report, as determined by the Agency, that is less than one year old, is on file with the Agency; and</P>

              <P>Loan applicants must meet all of the following requirements to be eligible for a Special Apple Program Loan:</P>
              <P>(a) The loan applicant must be an apple producer;</P>

Aliens must provide the appropriate Immigration and Naturalization Service forms to document their permanent residency;</P>
              <P>(c) The loan applicant and anyone who will execute the promissory note must possess the legal capacity to enter into contracts, including debt instruments;</P>
              <P>(d) At loan closing the loan applicant and anyone who will execute the promissory note must not be delinquent on any Federal debt, other than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Interest rate.</E> The interest rate will be fixed for the term of the loan. The rate will be established by the Agency and available in each Agency Office, based upon the cost of Government borrowing for loans of similar maturities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terms.</E> The loan term will be for up to 3 years, based upon the useful life of the security offered.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Security requirements.</E> The Agency will take a lien on the following security, if available, as necessary to adequately secure the loan:</P>
              <P>(1) Real estate;</P>
              <P>(2) Chattels;</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Documentation of security value.</E> (1) For loans that are for $30,000 or less, collateral value will be based on the best available, verifiable information.</P>
              <P>(2) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or greater, collateral value will be based on tax assessment of real estate and depreciation schedules of chattels, as applicable, less any existing liens.</P>
              <P>(3) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan amount, collateral value will be based on an appraisal. Such appraisals must be obtained by the applicant, at the applicant's expense and acceptable to the Agency. Appraisals of real estate must be completed in accordance with USPAP.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Repayment.</E> (1) All loan applicants must demonstrate that the loan can be repaid.</P>
              <P>(2) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or greater, repayment ability will be considered adequate without further documentation.</P>

              <P>(3) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan amount, repayment ability must be demonstrated <PRTPAGE P="368"/>using the farm's operating plan, including a projected cash flow budget based on historical performance. Such operating plan is required notwithstanding § 773.18 of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) For loans that are for more than $30,000, repayment ability must be demonstrated using the farm's operating plan, including a projected cash flow budget based on historical performance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Creditworthiness.</E> All loan applicants must have an acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt repayment.

              <P>The purpose of these regulations is to set forth the requirements designed to implement the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. The regulations require that a foreign person who acquires, disposes of, or holds an interest in United States agricultural land shall disclose such transactions and holdings to the Secretary <PRTPAGE P="379"/>of Agriculture. In particular, the regulations establish a system for the collection of information by the Agricultural Stablization and Conservation Service (FSA) pertaining to foreign investment in United States agricultural land. The information collected will be utilized in the preparation of periodic reports to Congress and the President by the Economic Research Service (ERS) concerning the effect of such holdings upon family farms and rural communities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Penalty review procedure.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Whenever it appears that a foreign person has violated the reporting obligation as described in paragraph (a) of § 781.4, a written notice of apparent liability will be sent to the foreign person's last known address by the Farm Service Agency. This notice will set forth the facts which indicate apparent liability, identify the type of violation listed in paragraph (a) of § 781.4 which is involved, state the amount of the penalty to be imposed, include a statement of fair market value of the foreign person's interest in the subject <PRTPAGE P="384"/>land, and summarize the courses of action available to the foreign person.</P>
              <P>(b) The foreign person involved shall respond to a notice of apparent liability within 60 days after the notice is mailed. If a foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent liability, the proposed penalty shall become final. Any of the following actions by the foreign person shall constitute a response meeting the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) Payment of the proposed penalty in the amount specified in the notice of apparent liability and filing of a report, if required, in compliance with § 781.3. The amount shall be paid by check or money order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States and shall be mailed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013. The Department is not responsible for the loss of currency sent through the mails.</P>
              <P>(2) Submission of a written statement denying liability for the penalty in whole or in part. Allegations made in any such statement must be supported by detailed factual data. The statement should be mailed to the Administrator, Farm Service Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013.</P>
              <P>(3) A request for a hearing on the proposed penalty may be filed in accordance with part 780 of this title.</P>
              <P>(c) After a final decision is issued pursuant to an appeal under part 780 of this title, the Administrator or Administrator's designee shall mail the foreign person a notice of the determination on appeal, stating whether a report must be filed or amended in compliance with § 781.3, the amount of the penalty (if any), and the date by which it must be paid. The foreign person shall file or amend the report as required by the Administrator. The penalty in the amount stated shall be paid by check or money order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States and shall be mailed to the United States Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013. The Department is not responsible for the loss of currency sent through the mails.</P>
              <P>(d) If the foreign person contests the notice of apparent liability by submitting a written statement or a request for a hearing thereon, the foreign person may elect either to pay the penalty or decline to pay the penalty pending resolution of the matter by the Administrator. If the Administrator determines that the foreign person is not liable for the penalty or is liable for less than the amount paid, the payment will be wholly or proportionally refunded. If the Administrator ultimately determines that the foreign person is liable, the penalty finally imposed shall not exceed the amount imposed in the notice of apparent liability.</P>
              <P>(e) If a foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent liability as required by paragraph (b) of this section, or fails to pay the penalty imposed by the Administrator under paragraph (d) of this section, the case will, without further notice, be referred by the Department to the Department of Justice for prosecution in the appropriate District Court to recover the amount of the penalty.</P>
              <P>(f) Any amounts approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for disbursement to a foreign person under the programs administered by the Department may be setoff against penalties assessed hereunder against such person, in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 13.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Time and method of application.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A request for benefits under this part must be submitted on the Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention Program Application. The application form may be obtained in person, by mail, by telephone, or by facsimile from any county FSA office. In addition, applicants may download a copy of the form at <E T="03">http://www.usda.gov/dafp/psd/.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The form may be obtained from and must be submitted to the FSA county office serving the county where the sheep and lamb operation is located. The completed form must be received by the FSA county office by the date established by FSA. Applications not received by that date will be disapproved and returned as not having been timely filed and the sheep and lamb operation filing the application will not be eligible for benefits under this program.</P>
              <P>(c) The sheep and lamb operation requesting benefits under this part must certify to the accuracy of the information provided in their application for benefits. All information provided is subject to verification and spot checks by FSA. Refusal to allow FSA or any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a determination of ineligibility. Data furnished by the applicant will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Providing a false certification will lead to ineligibility for payments and may be subject to additional civil and criminal sanctions.</P>

              <P>(d) The sheep and lamb operation requesting benefits under this part must maintain accurate records that document that they meet all eligibility requirements specified herein, as may be requested by FSA. Acceptable forms of supporting documentation include, but are not limited to: Sales receipts, farm management records, veterinarian certifications, scrapie program forms and identification numbers, as well as, other types of documents that prove the eligibility of the qualifying ewe <PRTPAGE P="392"/>lambs and the sheep and lamb operation. The supporting documentation provided must, at a minimum, include: date of lamb purchase or date of birth, date of lamb death (if applicable), lamb identification and control information, number of ewe lambs purchased or retained, and scrapie program identification numbers.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 784.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Payment eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Payments can be made, as agreed to by FSA and subject to the availability of funds, for eligible ewe lambs considered by FSA, as determined by FSA only, to have been acquired or held during the base period by eligible sheep and lamb operations for breeding purposes. Payments may be made for eligible ewe lambs held continuously by the operation, through the end of the compliance period, from the time of the first possession of the ewe lamb in the base period. The payment rate cannot exceed the rate provided for in § 784.6 and may be prorated pursuant to § 784.7. For purposes of this section, the “base period” is the period from August 1, 2003, through July 31, 2004. A purchase in the base period without possession in the base period will not be considered an acquisition in the base period for purposes of this section unless otherwise allowed by FSA.</P>
              <P>(b) For the ewe lamb to be eligible, a sheep and lamb operation must certify that the ewe lamb:</P>
              <P>(1) During at least part of the base period was a ewe lamb which was both, at the same time, not older than 18 months of age and had not produced an offspring; and</P>
              <P>(2) At the time of certification, does not possess any of the following characteristics:</P>
              <P>(i) Parrot mouth; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Foot rot.</P>
              <P>(c) The sheep and lamb operation must certify and agree to:</P>
              <P>(1) Maintain the qualifying ewe lambs in the herd for at least one complete, normal offspring lambing cycle, the end of which shall constitute the end of the compliance period for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, and actually maintain the lambs for that period in accord with that certification. The “offspring” lambing cycle refers to the time in which the qualifying ewe lamb's own offspring would be weaned, in a normal course, from that qualifying ewe if the ewe were to have offspring, irrespective of whether the ewe actually produces offspring.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon request by an AMS agent or FSA representative, allow the AMS agent or FSA Representative to verify that the ewe lambs meet qualifying characteristics. Spot checks will be conducted by FSA within 30 days of the end of the sign-up period. Any animal showing evidence of parrot mouth, foot rot, or scrapie in such spot checks will be considered to have had those conditions at the time of certification. Other spot checks may be conducted as needed.</P>
              <P>(3) Maintain documentation of any death loss of qualifying ewe lambs.</P>
              <P>(4) Agree to refund any payments made with respect to any ewe lamb or offspring that has died before completing the full program requirements where said deaths for the operation exceed 10 percent.</P>
              <P>(5) Be in compliance with all requirements relating to scrapie, as described in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79.</P>
              <P>(d) To be eligible for any payments addressed under this section, a sheep and lamb operation must be engaged in the business of producing and marketing agricultural products at the time of filing the application.</P>
              <P>(e) In addition, to be eligible for payment, a sheep and lamb operation must submit a timely application during the application period for benefits and comply with all other terms and conditions of this part or that are contained in the application for such benefits, and such other conditions as may be imposed by FSA.</P>
              <P>(f) Proof that each lamb was held during and through the end of the base period as required by paragraph (a) of this section, as must be determined individually for each lamb, shall be provided in such manner, and with such access to the operation and the documents and information related to the operation, as FSA may request.</P>

In the event that approval of all eligible applications would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA shall prorate the available funds by a national factor to reduce the expected payments to be made to the amount available. The payment shall be made based on the national factored rate as determined by FSA. FSA shall prorate the payments in such manner as it, in its sole discretion, finds appropriate and reasonable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Subject to the availability of funds, this part specifies the terms and conditions applicable to the Dairy Disaster Assistance Payment Program (DDAP-III) authorized by section 9007 of Public Law 110-28 (extended by Pub. L. 110-161). Benefits are available to eligible United States producers who have suffered dairy production losses in eligible counties as a result of a natural disaster declared during the period between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, (that is, after January 1, 2005, and before December 31, 2007).</P>
              <P>(b) To be eligible for this program, a producer must have been a milk producer anytime during the period of January 2, 2005, through December 30, 2007, in a county declared a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture, declared a major disaster or emergency designated by the President of the United States. For a county for which there was a timely Presidential declaration, but the declaration did not cover the loss, the county may still be eligible if the county is one for which an appropriate determination of a Farm Service Agency (FSA) Administrator's Physical Loss Notice applies. Counties contiguous to a county that is directly eligible by way of a natural disaster declaration are also eligible. Only losses occurring in eligible counties are eligible for payment in this program.</P>
              <P>(c) Subject to the availability of funds, FSA will provide benefits to eligible dairy producers. Additional terms and conditions may be specified in the payment application that must be completed and submitted by producers to receive a disaster assistance payment for dairy production losses.</P>
              <P>(d) To be eligible for payments, producers must meet the provisions of, and their losses must meet the conditions of, this part and any other conditions imposed by FSA.</P>

              <P>(a) DDAP-III will be administered under the general supervision of the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, and be carried out in the field by FSA State and county committees (State and county committees) and FSA employees.</P>
              <P>(b) State and county committees, and representatives and employees thereof, do not have the authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) The State committee will take any action required by the regulations of this part that has not been taken by the county committee. The State committee will also:</P>

              <P>(1) Correct, or require the county committee to correct, any action taken <PRTPAGE P="402"/>by such county committee that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part; and</P>
              <P>(2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) No provision of delegation in this part to a State or county committee will preclude the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by the State or county committee.</P>
              <P>(e) The Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines in cases where lateness or failure to meet such requirements do not adversely affect the operation of the DDAP-III and does not violate statutory limitations of the program.</P>
              <P>(f) Data furnished by the applicants is used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Although participation in DDAP-III is voluntary, program benefits will not be provided unless the producer furnishes all requested data.</P>

              <P>(a) Evidence of production is required to establish the commercial marketing and production history of the dairy operation so that dairy production losses can be computed in accordance with § 786.106.</P>
              <P>(b) A dairy producer must, based on the instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's commercial production, including any dairy herd inventory records available for the operation, for the years of the base period (2003 and 2004 calendar years) and disaster claim period that corresponds with the issuance date of the applicable natural disaster declaration.</P>
              <P>(1) A producer must certify and provide such proof as requested that losses for which compensation is claimed were related to the disaster declaration issued and occurred in an eligible county during the eligible claim period.</P>
              <P>(2) A producer must certify to the average number of cows in the dairy herd during the base period and applicable disaster claim period when there is insufficient documentation available for verification.</P>
              <P>(3) Additional supporting documentation may be requested by FSA as necessary to verify production losses to the satisfaction of FSA.</P>

              <P>(c) Adequate proof of production history of the dairy operation under paragraph (b) of this section must be based <PRTPAGE P="405"/>on milk marketing statements obtained from the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing cooperative. Supporting documents may include, but are not limited to: Tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies of any payments received from other sources for production losses, or any other documents available to confirm or adjust the production history losses incurred by the dairy operation. All information provided is subject to verification, spot check, and audit by FSA.</P>
              <P>(d) As specified in § 786.106, loss calculations will be based on comparing the expected base annual production consistent with this part and the actual production during the applicable disaster claim year. Such calculations are subject to adjustments as may be appropriate such as a correction for losses not due to the disaster. If adequate proof of normally marketed production and any other production for relevant periods is not presented to the satisfaction of FSA, the request for benefits will be rejected. Special adjustments for new producers may be made as determined necessary by the Administrator.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of losses incurred.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Eligible payable losses are calculated on a dairy operation by dairy operation basis and are limited to those occurring during the applicable disaster claim period, as provided by § 786.104(g), that corresponds with the applicable natural disaster declaration. Specifically, dairy production losses incurred by producers under this part are determined on the established history of the dairy operation's average number of cows in the dairy herd and actual commercial production marketed during the base period and applicable disaster claim period that corresponds with the applicable natural disaster declaration, as provided by the dairy operation consistent with § 786.105. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the base annual production, as defined in § 786.102 and established in § 786.104(g) is determined for each applicable disaster year based on the average annual production per cow determined according to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The average of annual marketed production during the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004, divided by;</P>
              <P>(2) The average number of cows in the dairy operation's herd during the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004.</P>
              <P>(b) If relevant information to calculate the average annual production per cow for one or both of the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004, is not available, an alternative method of determining the average annual production per cow may be established by the FSA Administrator. For example, for new dairies not in operation during 2003 and 2004, information from three similar farms may be obtained by FSA to estimate base annual production.</P>
              <P>(c) The average annual production per cow, as determined according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, is multiplied by the average number of cows in the dairy operation's herd during the applicable disaster year (excluding cow losses resulting from the disaster occurrence), to determine base annual production for the dairy operation for each applicable disaster claim period year.</P>
              <P>(d) The eligible dairy production losses for a dairy operation for each of the authorized disaster claim period years will be:</P>
              <P>(1) The relevant period's base annual production for the dairy operation calculated under paragraph (c) of this section less,</P>
              <P>(2) For each such disaster claim period for each dairy operation the actual commercially-marketed production relevant to that period.</P>

              <P>(e) Spoiled or dumped milk, disposed of for reasons unrelated to the disaster occurrence, must be counted as production for the relevant disaster claim period. Actual production losses may be adjusted to the extent the reduction in production is not certified by the producer to be the result of the disaster identified in the natural disaster declaration or is determined by FSA not to be related to the natural disaster identified in the natural disaster declaration. FSA county committees will determine production losses that are not caused by the disaster associated with the natural disaster declaration. <PRTPAGE P="406"/>The calculated production loss determined in § 786.106(d) will be adjusted to account for pounds of production losses determined by the FSA county committee to not have been associated with the declared natural disaster for an eligible disaster county. The FSA county committee may convert cow numbers to actual pounds of production used in the adjustment, by multiplying the average annual production per cow determined from base period information, by the applicable number of cows determined to be ineligible to generate claims for benefits. Other appropriate adjustments will be made on such basis as the Deputy Administrator finds to be consistent with the objectives of the program.</P>
              <P>(f) Actual production, as adjusted, that exceeds the base annual production will mean that the dairy operation incurred no eligible production losses for the corresponding claim period as a result of the natural disaster.</P>
              <P>(g) Eligible production losses as otherwise determined under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section for each authorized year of the program are added together to determine total eligible losses incurred by the dairy operation under DDAP-III subject to all other eligibility requirements as may be included in this part or elsewhere, including the deduction for previous payments including those made under a previous DDAP program.</P>
              <P>(h) Payment on eligible dairy operation losses will be calculated using whole pounds of milk. No double counting is permitted, and only one payment will be made for each pound of milk calculated as an eligible loss after the distribution of the dairy operation's eligible production loss among the producers of the dairy operation according to § 786.107(b). Payments under this part will not be affected by any payments for dumped or spoiled milk that the dairy operation may have received from its milk handler, marketing cooperative, or any other private party; however, produced milk that was dumped or spoiled for reasons unrelated to the disaster occurrence will still count as production.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the availability of funds, the payment rate for eligible production losses determined according to § 786.106 is, depending on the State, the annual average Mailbox milk price for the Marketing Order, applicable to the State where the eligible disaster county is located, as reported by the Agricultural Marketing Service during the relevant period. States not regulated under a Marketing Order will be assigned a payment rate based on contiguous or nearby State's Mailbox milk price. Maximum per pound payment rates for eligible losses for dairy operations located in specific states during the relevant period are as follows:</P>

                  <E T="04">Note:</E> Calculations are rounded to 7 decimal places.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>* Payment rates for 2007 are currently unavailable, but will be based on the annual average Mailbox milk price for the Marketing Order, applicable to the State where the eligible disaster county is located, as reported by the Agricultural Marketing Service, consistent with payment rates provided for 2005 and 2006.</TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>(b) Subject to the availability of funds, each eligible dairy operation's payment is calculated by multiplying the applicable payment rate under paragraph (a) of this section by the operation's total eligible losses as adjusted pursuant to this part. Where there are multiple producers in the dairy operation, individual producers' payments are disbursed according to each producer's share of the dairy operation's production as specified in the application.</P>
              <P>(c) If the total value of losses claimed nationwide under paragraph (b) of this section exceeds the $16 million available for the DDAP-III, less any reserve that may be created under paragraph (e) of this section, total eligible losses of individual dairy operations that, as calculated as an overall percentage for each full disaster claim period applicable to the disaster declaration, are greater than 20 percent of the total base annual production will be paid at the maximum rate under paragraph (a) of this section to the extent available funding allows. A loss of over 20 percent in only one or two months during the applicable disaster claim period does not of itself qualify for the maximum per-pound payment. Rather, the priority level must be reached as an average over the whole disaster claim period for the relevant calendar year. Total eligible losses for a producer, as calculated under § 786.106, of less than or equal to 20 percent during the eligible claim period will then be paid at a rate, not to exceed the rate allowed in paragraph (a) of this section, determined by dividing the eligible losses of less than 20 percent by the funds remaining after making payments for all eligible losses above the 20-percent threshold.</P>
              <P>(d) In no event will the payment exceed the value determined by multiplying the producer's total eligible loss times the average price received for commercial milk production in the producer's area as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) No participant will receive disaster benefits under this part that in combination with the value of production not lost would result in an amount that exceeds 95 percent of the value of the expected production for the relevant period as estimated by the Secretary. Unless otherwise program funds would not be fully expended, the sum of the value of the production not lost, if any; and the disaster payment received under this part, cannot exceed 95 percent of what the production's value would have been if there had been no loss. In no case, however, may the value of production and the payment exceed the value the milk would have without the loss.</P>

                <P>(b) Section 202 of Executive Order 13603 specifies that the priorities and allocations authority may be used only to support programs that have been determined in writing as necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense by:</P>
                <P>(1) The Secretary of Defense with respect to military production and construction, military assistance to foreign nations, military use of civil transportation, stockpiles managed by the Department of Defense, space, and directly related activities;</P>
                <P>(2) The Secretary of Energy with respect to energy production and construction, distribution and use, and directly related activities; or</P>

                <P>(b) Within USDA, authority to administer APAS has been delegated to the Administrator, Farm Service Agency, through the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services. (See §§ 2.16(a)(6) and 2.42(a)(5) of this title.) The Farm Service Agency Administrator will coordinate APAS implementation and administration through the Director, USDA Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination, as delegated by the Assistant Secretary for Administration.

                <SUBJECT>Priority ratings.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Levels of priority.</E> Priority levels designate differences between orders based on national defense including emergency preparedness requirements.</P>
                <P>(1) There are two levels of priority established by APAS, identified by the rating symbols “DO” and “DX.”</P>
                <P>(2) All DO-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over unrated orders. All DX-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see § 789.14(c).)</P>
                <P>(3) In addition, a directive regarding priority treatment for a given item issued by the resource agency with priorities jurisdiction for that item takes precedence over any DX-rated order, DO-rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the directive. (For more information on directives, see § 789.42.)</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Program identification symbols.</E> Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. The list of currently approved programs and their identification symbols are listed in Schedule I. For example, P1 identifies a program involving food and food resources processing and storage. Program identification symbols, in themselves, do not connote any priority. Additional programs may be approved under the procedures of Executive Order 13603 at any time.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Priority ratings.</E> A priority rating consists of the rating symbol DO or DX followed by the program identification symbol, such as P1 or P2. Thus, a contract for the supply of livestock feed will contain a DO-P1 or DX-P1 priority rating.</P>

                <P>(1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person must accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.</P>
                <P>(2) A person must not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory rejection.</E> Unless otherwise directed by USDA for a rated order involving food resources, food resource facilities, livestock resources, veterinary resources, plant health resources, or the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer:</P>
                <P>(1) A person must not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection in this section.</P>
                <P>(2) A person must not accept a DO-rated order for delivery on a date that would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO- or DX-rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.</P>
                <P>(3) A person must not accept a DX-rated order for delivery on a date that would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX-rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.</P>
                <P>(4) If a person is unable to fill all of the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders that can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.</P>
                <P>(5) A person must reject the rated order if the person is prohibited by Federal law from meeting the terms of the order.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Optional rejection.</E> Unless otherwise directed by USDA for a rated order involving food resources, food resource facilities, livestock resources, veterinary resources, plant health resources, or the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:</P>
                <P>(1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;</P>
                <P>(2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not capable of being performed;</P>

                <P>(3) If the order is for an item or service produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for 2 years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items or provided similar services, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production or <PRTPAGE P="416"/>service, whichever is greater, sold or provided within the past 2 years;</P>
                <P>(4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the Federal Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;</P>
                <P>(5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of USDA, issued under the authority of the Defense Production Act or another relevant law.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer notification requirements.</E> A person in receipt of a rated order is required to provide to the customer placing the order written or electronic notification of acceptance or rejection of the order.</P>
                <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a person must accept or reject a rated order in writing or electronically within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a DO-rated order and within ten (10) working days after receipt of a DX-rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in writing or electronically for the rejection.</P>
                <P>(2) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written or electronic confirmation must be provided within 5 working days.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Exception for emergency preparedness conditions.</E> If the rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness and includes the additional statement as specified in § 789.12(a)(4)(ii), a person must accept or reject a rated order and send the acceptance or rejection in writing or in an electronic format:</P>
                <P>(1) Within 6 hours after receipt of the order if the order is issued in response to a hazard that has occurred; or</P>
                <P>(2) Within the greater of 12 hours or the time specified in the order, if the order is issued to prepare for an imminent hazard.</P>

                <P>(b) DO-rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery or services being performed against unrated orders. Similarly, DX-rated orders must be given preference over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (Examples: If a person receives a DO-rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX-rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO-rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX-rated order.)</P>
                <P>(c) For conflicting rated orders:</P>
                <P>(1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person must give precedence to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person must give precedence to those orders that have the earliest receipt dates.</P>

                <P>(2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts as specified in this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 789.20 through 789.24. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as specified in §§ 789.20 through 789.24. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the <PRTPAGE P="417"/>person must notify the customer as provided in § 789.13(d)(2).</P>
                <P>(d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 789.17(b).</P>

                <P>(a) A person must use rated orders as necessary with suppliers to obtain items or services needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in this part or as directed by USDA.</P>
                <P>(b) The priority rating must be included as necessary on each successive order placed to obtain items or services needed to fill a customer's rated order. This continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire procurement chain.</P>

                <P>(a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or canceled by:</P>
                <P>(1) An official action of USDA; or</P>
                <P>(2) Written notification from the person who placed the rated order.</P>
                <P>(b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, or a DO rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the change is received by the supplier.</P>
                <P>(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule constitutes a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 789.13.</P>
                <P>(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order:</P>
                <P>(1) A change in shipping destination;</P>
                <P>(2) A reduction in the total amount of the order;</P>
                <P>(3) An increase in the total amount of the order that has a negligible impact upon deliveries;</P>
                <P>(4) A minor variation in size or design; or</P>
                <P>(5) A change that is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.</P>
                <P>(e) If a person no longer needs items or services to fill a rated order, any rated orders placed with suppliers for the items or services, or the priority rating on those orders, must be canceled.</P>
                <P>(f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is changed or canceled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in writing.</P>

                <P>(a) A person must use rated orders as necessary to obtain:</P>
                <P>(1) Items that will be physically incorporated into other items to fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally consumed or converted into scrap or by-products in the course of processing;</P>

                <P>(1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of the inventory.</P>
                <P>(2) A DO rating and the program identification symbol indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX rating must not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX-rated order.</P>
                <P>(3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification symbol P4 must be used (that is DO-P4).</P>

                <P>(c) A person may combine DX- and DO-rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items or services covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly. If different program identification symbols are indicated on those rated orders <PRTPAGE P="418"/>of equal priority, the person must use the program identification symbol P4 (that is DO-P4 or DX-P4).</P>
                <P>(d) For combining rated and unrated orders:</P>
                <P>(1) A person may combine rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and</P>

                <P>(ii) The four elements of a rated order, as required by § 789.12, are included on the order with the statement required in § 789.12(a)(4)(i) modified to read:

                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the purchase order as provided in § 789.13 and give preferential treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part. This part must not be used to require preferential treatment for the unrated portion of the order.</P>
                <P>(3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception as specified in § 789.60.</P>
                <P>(e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.</P>
                <P>(f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less than $75,000 or one-half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see 48 CFR 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems) whichever amount is greater, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) APAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, if production or delivery problems arise, a person should immediately contact the Farm Service Agency Administrator for special priorities assistance pursuant to §§ 789.20 through 789.24 and as directed by § 789.73. If the Farm Service Agency is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, USDA may forward the request to another resource agency, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is a service provided to alleviate problems.</P>
                <P>(b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.</P>

                <P>(c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority must be submitted on Form AD-2102 (OMB Control Number 0560-0280) to the Farm Service Agency as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. Form AD-2102 may be obtained from USDA by downloading the form and instructions from <E T="03">http://forms.sc.egov.usda.gov/eForms/welcomeAction.do?Home</E> or by contacting the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency as specified in § 789.73. Either mail or fax the form to USDA, using the address or fax number shown on the form.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Requests for priority rating authority.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Rating authority for items or services not normally rated.</E> If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items or services not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items or services.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rating authority for production or construction equipment.</E> For a rated order for production or construction equipment not under the resource jurisdiction of USDA, follow the regulation in 15 CFR part 700.</P>
                <P>(1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on Form BIS-999 (see 15 CFR 700.51). Form BIS-999 may be obtained from USDA as specified in § 789.20(c) or from the Department of Commerce as specified in 15 CFR 700.50.</P>
                <P>(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.</P>
                <P>(c) For rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract:</P>

                <P>(1) In certain cases and upon specific request, USDA, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In <PRTPAGE P="420"/>these instances, the person requesting advance rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from USDA. The person assumes any business risk associated with the placing of a rated order if the order has to be canceled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.</P>

                <P>(2) The person must state the following in the request:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from USDA and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits USDA or any other government agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we understand that the Federal Government will not be liable for any cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the priority rating authorized as a result of this request.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, USDA will consider, among other things, the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;</P>
                <P>(ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;</P>
                <P>(iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time; and</P>
                <P>(v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.</P>
                <P>(4) USDA may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted through paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person will promptly notify each supplier who has received any rated order related to the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on the order is canceled.</P>

                <P>(d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings, and information will not be required at any place other than where they are usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the administrative subpoena or demand for information, a duly authorized official of USDA is furnished with copies of such material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of USDA as to the content of the material.</P>

                <P>(e) An administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will include the name, title, or official position of the person to be served, the evidence sought, and its general relevance to the scope and <PRTPAGE P="424"/>purpose of the audit, investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will describe the requirements.</P>
                <P>(f) Service of documents will be made in the following manner:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">In person.</E> Service of a demand for information or inspection authorization will be made personally, or by certified mail-return receipt requested at the person's last known address.

              <P>(2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than three years.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as otherwise determined by FSA, no installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to be submitted sooner than 15 workdays following its request by FSA.</P>
              <P>(c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in effect on the date such agreement is executed, unless such interest is waived or reduced by FSA. The installment agreement shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults.</P>
              <P>(d) FSA may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor fails to comply with its terms.</P>
              <P>(e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides FSA a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.</P>

              <P>(f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to FSA, FSA may allow the debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment is to be <PRTPAGE P="431"/>applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a voluntary installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to such debts as determined by FSA.</P>

              <P>(3) Cases in which FSA must adjust, by increasing or decreasing, a payment which is to be paid under a contract in order to properly make other payments due by FSA; and</P>
              <P>(4) Any case in which a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the debt for the type of debt involved.</P>
              <P>(b) Debts due FSA or CCC may be collected by administrative offset from amounts payable by FSA when:</P>
              <P>(1) The debtor has been provided written notification of the basis and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make payment.

              <P>(4) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt will be collected by administrative offset if not paid; and</P>
              <P>(5) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by an applicable period of limitation, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts payable by FSA:</P>
              <P>(1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or</P>
              <P>(2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of FSA or the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of a contract or a violation of FSA program requirements, and offset is considered necessary by FSA to protect the financial interests of the Government.</P>
              <P>(e) FSA may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice FSA' ability to collect the debt; and</P>

The amount to be offset shall not exceed the principal sum owed by the debtor, plus interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment interest, penalties and administrative costs that have been assessed;</P>
              <P>(v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order of the bankruptcy court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and</P>

Notice of such action must be sent to the appropriate FSA office.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) After FSA has complied with the provisions of this part, FSA may request other agencies of the Government to offset amounts payable by them to persons indebted to FSA.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the provisions at § 792.19 shall apply.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of priority without regard to the date of the request for such collection:</P>

              <P>(ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by FSA.</P>
              <P>(iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by FSA.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, FSA may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order of priority in applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered to be in the Government's best interest. Such decision shall be made by FSA based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</P>
              <P>(i) Amounts recovered by offset for FSA and CCC debts but later found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.</P>

              <P>(2) When FSA determines that the debtor has established an entity, or reorganized, transferred ownership of, or changed in some other manner, their operation, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the claim or debt.</P>
              <P>(m) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated amount of the debt, including interest, administrative charges, and penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger specified amount be offset.</P>
              <P>(n) Offset action will not be taken against payments when:</P>
              <P>(1) A debt has been discharged as provided in § 792.16.</P>
              <P>(2) FSA determines such action will unduly interfere with the administration of an FSA or CCC program.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 792.10</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Late payment interest, penalty and administrative charges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not apply:</P>
              <P>(1) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall be charged to the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(2) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or contract either prohibits the charging of such interest or specifies the interest or charges applicable to the debt involved;</P>
              <P>(3) If the late payment interest is waived by FSA in accordance with § 792.11.</P>
              <P>(4) To administrative charges as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) FSA will assess late payment interest on the full amount of delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term “full amount of the delinquent debt” means the sum of the principal, accrued program interest, and any other charges which are otherwise due and owing to FSA on the delinquent debt at the time the late payment interest is assessed, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate of interest which FSA charges on delinquent debts. The late payment interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's current value <PRTPAGE P="434"/>of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. The rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment Act was chosen as an alternative rate to ensure that the Government would recoup interest at a rate which was at least as high as that which it pays for late payments.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract, or other agreement with specific provisions for late payment interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of the debt from the first day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise provided by statute.</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, contract, or agreement containing specific provisions for late payment interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to accrue from the date on which notice of the debt, including notice of late payment interest, is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor.</P>
              <P>(3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except when a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement. FSA may then set a new rate of interest which reflects the late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is executed. All charges which accrued, but which were not collected under the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid under a new repayment agreement.</P>
              <P>(4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a daily basis.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a penalty charge of three (3) percent per annum will be assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid ninety (90) days after the date described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, if no repayment schedule satisfactory to FSA has been agreed upon. Such penalty charge will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began to accrue and applied on a daily basis. Such rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid.</P>
              <P>(f) FSA shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs of processing delinquent debts against the debtor, to the extent such costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are not limited to, costs incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing contractors for collection services, costs of selling collateral or property to satisfy the debt.</P>
              <P>(g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments will be applied first to administrative charges, second to the penalty charge assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and late payment interest, and third to outstanding principal.</P>

              <P>(a) FSA shall waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment interest began to accrue.</P>
              <P>(b) FSA may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion of the penalty charge on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 CFR part 780 or other applicable appeal procedures from either the date of the appeal or the date such interest began to accrue, whichever is later, until the date a final administrative determination is issued. Such waiver shall not apply for any delay due to:</P>
              <P>(1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled hearing;</P>
              <P>(2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the hearing to present additional information or a written closing statement; or</P>
              <P>(3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the reviewing authority.</P>

              <P>(c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, the penalty charge and administrative charges under this part may be waived by FSA in full, or in part, if it is determined by the Controller, FSA, or his or her designee, <PRTPAGE P="435"/>that such action is in the best interest of FSA.</P>

Three of the shareholders propose forming a partnership which they would own equally. The partnership would cash lease land and equipment from the corporation with the objective of having the three partners considered as separate persons for purposes of applying the payment limitation under the provisions of § 795.7 of the regulations.</P>
                  <P>The formation of such a partnership and the leasing of land from a corporation in which they hold a major interest would not constitute a substantive and bona fide change in operations. Therefore, the corporation and the partners would be limited to a single payment limitation.</P>

                  <P>Three individuals each have individual farming operations which, if continued unchanged, would permit them to have a total of three payment limitations.</P>
                  <P>The three individuals propose forming a corporation which they would own equally. The corporation would then cash lease a portion of the farmland owned and previously operated by the individuals with the objective of having the corporation considered as a separate person for purposes of applying the payment limitation under the provisions of § 795.8 of the regulations. The formation of such a corporation and the leasing of land from the stockholders would not constitute a substantive and bona fide change in operations.

                <SUBJECT>Custom farming.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Custom farming is the performance of services on a farm such as land preparation, seeding, cultivating, applying pesticides, and harvesting for hire with remuneration on a unit of work basis, except that, for the purpose of applying the provisions of this section, the harvesting of crops and the application of agricultural chemicals by firms regularly engaged in such businesses shall not be regarded as custom farming.

                <P>(1) The compensation for the custom farming is paid at a unit of work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon the amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person performing the custom farming (and any other entity in which such person has more than a 20-percent interest) has no interest, directly or indirectly, (i) in the crop on the farm by taking any risk in the production of the crop, sharing in the proceeds of the crop, granting or guaranteeing the financing of the crop, (ii) in the allotment on the farm, or (iii) in the farm as landowner, landlord, mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, sharecropper, or any other similar capacity.</P>
                <P>(b) A person having more than a 20-percent interest in any legal entity performing custom farming shall be considered as being separate from the person for whom the custom farming is performed only if:</P>
                <P>(1) The compensation for the custom farming service is paid at a unit of work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon the amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person having such interest in the legal entity performing the custom farming has no interest, directly or indirectly, (i) in the crop on the farm by taking any risk in the production of the crop, sharing in the proceeds of the corp, granting or guaranteeing the financing of the crop, (ii) in the allotment on the farm, or (iii) in the farm as landowner, landlord, mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, sharecropper, or in any other similar capacity.</P>

Such acts shall include, but are not limited to, concealing from the county committee any information having a bearing on the application of the rules of this part or submitting false information to the county committee (for example, a set-aside agreement which is entered into that differs from information furnished to the county committee concerning the manner in which program payments are actually shared, concerning the actual facts of a sale, or concerning the transfer of property) or creating fictitious entities for the purpose of concealing the interest of a person in a farming operation.</P>

              <P>5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) requires that certain materials be made available for public inspection and copying. Members of the public may request access to such materials maintained by FSA and/or CCC at the Office of the Director, Information Division, Farm Service Agency, Room 3608 South Building, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013, between the hours of 8:15 and 4:45 p.m., Monday through Friday.</P>

              <P>5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) requires that each agency publish or otherwise make available a current index of all materials required to be made available for public inspection and copying. FSA maintains an index of FSA National Handbooks, CCC Board Dockets, decisions of the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of Agriculture affecting FSA or CCC, and Marketing Quota Review Committee determinations. In view of the small number of public requests for such index, publication of the index is unnecessary and impractical. The index is maintained and available to the public at the office shown in § 798.2 and copies of the index are available upon request in person or by mail to that office.</P>

Each FSA office in the field and each FSA office and division in Washington (see statement of Organization and Functions of FSA, 40 FR 18815, and of CCC, 35 FR 14951, and any amendments thereto) is designated as an “information center” and shall make space available to inspect and copy records in their custody not exempted from disclosure. Copies of records shall also be made available upon request. The head of each office or division is authorized to receive requests for records and to make determinations regarding requests for records in the office's custody in accordance with 7 CFR 1.4(c). Requests to Washington divisions and offices shall be addressed to USDA, FSA, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013. The heads of FSA field offices shall be addressed as listed in the local telephone directory under “U.S. Government, Department of Agriculture, FSA”.

                <SUBJECT>FSA environmental policy.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) FSA will:</P>
                <P>(1) Use all practical means to protect and, where possible, improve the quality of the human environment and avoid or minimize any adverse environmental effects of FSA actions;</P>

                <P>(2) Ensure protection of basic resources, including important farmlands and forestlands, prime rangelands, wetlands, floodplains, and other protected resources. Consistent with Departmental Regulations and related Executive Orders, it is FSA policy not to approve or fund proposed actions that, as a result of their identifiable impacts, direct, indirect, or cumulative, would lead to or accommodate either the conversion of these land uses or encroachment upon them.<PRTPAGE P="448"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) Ensure that the requirements of NEPA and other State and national environmental policies designed to protect and manage impacts on the human environment are addressed:</P>
                <P>(i) As required by 40 CFR 1501.2, at the earliest feasible stage in the planning of any FSA action,</P>
                <P>(ii) Concurrently and in a coordinated manner,</P>
                <P>(iii) During all stages of the decision making process,</P>
                <P>(iv) Using professional and scientific integrity in their discussions and analyses, identifying applicable methodologies, and explaining the use of the best available information, and</P>
                <P>(v) In consultation with all interested parties, including Federal, State, and Tribal governments;</P>

                <P>(4) As appropriate, make environmental review available to the public through various means, which can include, but are not limited to: Posting on the National FSA Web site or a State FSA Web site, publishing in the <E T="03">Federal Register,</E> or publishing in a newspaper in the area of interest; and</P>
                <P>(5) Ensure that, if an FSA proposed action represents one of several phases of a larger action, the entire action is the subject of an environmental review independent of the phases of funding. If the FSA proposed action is one segment of a larger action, the entire action will be used in determining the appropriate level of FSA environmental review.</P>
                <P>(b) A proposed action that consists of more than one categorically excluded proposed action may be categorically excluded only if all components of the proposed action are included within one or more categorical exclusions and trigger no extraordinary circumstances. The component of a proposed action that requires the highest level of NEPA review will be used to determine the required level of the NEPA review.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose of categorical exclusion process.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) FSA has determined that the categories of proposed actions listed in §§ 799.31 and 799.32 do not normally individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and do not threaten a violation of applicable statutory, regulatory, or permit requirements for environment, safety, and health, including requirements of Executive Orders and other USDA regulations in this chapter. Based on FSA's previous experience implementing these actions and similar actions through the completion of EAs, these proposed actions are categorically excluded.</P>
                <P>(b) If a proposed action falls within one of the categories of proposed actions listed in § 1b.3 of this title, § 799.31, or § 799.32, and there are no extraordinary circumstances present as specified in § 799.33, then the proposed action is categorically excluded from the requirements to prepare an EA or an EIS.</P>
                <P>(c) Those proposed actions in categories in § 799.31 or § 799.32 will be considered categorical exclusions unless it is determined there are extraordinary circumstances, as specified in § 799.33.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusions to be recorded on an ESW.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Proposed actions listed in this section involve no new ground disturbance below the existing plow zone (does not exceed the depth of previous tillage or disturbance) and therefore only need to be recorded on the ESW; no further review will be required. Unless otherwise noted, the proposed actions in this section also do not have the potential to cause effects to historic properties, and will therefore not be reviewed for compliance with section 106 of NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108) or its implementing regulations, 36 CFR part 800. However, some proposed actions may require other Federal consultation to determine if there are extraordinary circumstances as specified in § 799.33.</P>
                <P>(b) The following proposed actions are categorically excluded. These proposed actions are grouped into broader categories of similar types of proposed actions. Those proposed actions that are similar in scope (purpose, intent, and breadth) and the potential significance of impacts to those listed in this section, but not specifically listed in § 799.31 or § 799.32, will be considered categorical exclusions in this category, unless it is determined that extraordinary circumstances exist, as specified in § 799.33:</P>

                <P>(a) As specified in 40 CFR 1508.4, in the definition of categorical exclusion, procedures are required to provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally categorically excluded action may have a significant environmental effect. The presence and impacts of extraordinary circumstances require heightened review of proposed actions that would otherwise be categorically excluded. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Scientific controversy about environmental effects of the proposed action;</P>
                <P>(2) Impacts that are potentially adverse, significant, uncertain, or involve unique or unknown risks, including, but not limited to, impacts to protected resources. Protected resources include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Property (for example, sites, buildings, structures, and objects) of historic, archeological, or architectural significance, as designated by Federal, Tribal, State, or local governments, or property eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;</P>

                <P>(ii) Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or their habitat (including critical habitat), or Federally-proposed or candidate species or their habitat;<PRTPAGE P="460"/>

                <P>(3) A proposed action that is also “connected” (as specified in 40 CFR 1508.25(a)(1)) to other actions with potential impacts;</P>
                <P>(4) A proposed action that is related to other proposed actions with cumulative impacts (40 CFR 1508.25(a)(2));</P>
                <P>(5) A proposed action that does not comply with 40 CFR 1506.1, “Limitations on actions during NEPA process;” and</P>
                <P>(6) A proposed action that violates any existing Federal, State, or local government law, policy, or requirements (for example, wetland laws, Clean Water Act-related requirements, water rights).</P>
                <P>(b) FSA will use the ESW to review proposed actions that are eligible for categorical exclusion to determine if extraordinary circumstances exist that could impact protected resources. If an extraordinary circumstance exists, and cannot be avoided or appropriately mitigated, an EA or EIS will be prepared, as specified in this part. Specifically, FSA will complete a review with the ESW for proposed actions that fall within the list of categorical exclusions specified in § 799.32 to determine whether extraordinary circumstances are present.</P>
                <P>(c) For any proposed actions that have the potential to cause effects to historic properties, endangered species, waters of the United States, wetlands, and other protected resources, FSA will ensure appropriate analyses is completed to comply with the following mandates:</P>
                <P>(1) For section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108), the regulations in 36 CFR part 800, “Protection of Historic Properties;” if an authorized technical representative from another Federal agency assists with compliance with 36 CFR part 800, FSA will remain responsible for any consultation with SHPO, THPO, or Tribal governments;</P>

                <SUBJECT>Tiering.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) As specified in 40 CFR 1508.28, tiering is a process of covering general environmental review in a broad PEIS, followed by subsequent narrower scope analysis to address specific proposed actions, action stages, or sites. FSA will use tiering when FSA prepares a broad PEIS and subsequently prepares <PRTPAGE P="465"/>a site-specific ESW, EA, or PEA for a proposed action included within the program addressed in the original, broad PEIS.</P>
                <P>(b) When FSA uses tiering in a broad PEIS, the subsequent ESW, EA, or PEA will:</P>
                <P>(1) Summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement;</P>
                <P>(2) Incorporate by reference the discussions from the broader statement and the conclusions carried forward into the subsequent tiered analysis and documentation; and</P>
                <P>(3) State where the PEIS document is available.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 799.58</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Adoption of an EIS prepared by another entity.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) FSA may elect to adopt an EIS prepared by another Federal agency, State, or Tribal government if:</P>
                <P>(1) The NECM determines that the EIS and the analyses and procedures by which they were developed meet the requirements of this part; and</P>
                <P>(2) The agency responsible for preparing the EIS concurs.</P>
                <P>(b) For the adoption of another Federal agency EIS, FSA will follow the procedures specified in the CEQ regulations in 40 CFR 1506.3.</P>
                <P>(c) For the adoption of an EIS from a state or tribe that has an established state or tribal procedural equivalent to the NEPA process (generally referred to as “mini-NEPA”), FSA will follow the procedures specified in the CEQ regulations in 40 CFR 1506.3.</P>

                <P>(a) FSA will issue a Record of Decision (ROD) within the time periods specified in 40 CFR 1506.10(b) but no sooner than 30 days after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's publication of the NOA of the final EIS. The ROD will:</P>
                <P>(1) State the decision reached;</P>
                <P>(2) Identify all alternatives considered by FSA in reaching its decision, specifying the alternative or alternatives considered to be environmentally preferable;</P>
                <P>(3) Identify and discuss all factors, including any essential considerations of national policy, which were considered by FSA in making its decision, and state how those considerations entered into its decision; and</P>
                <P>(4) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted and, if not, explain why these mitigation measures were not adopted. A monitoring and enforcement program will be adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.</P>
                <P>(b) FSA will distribute the ROD to all parties who request it.</P>

                <P>(c) FSA will publish the ROD or a notice of availability of the ROD in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

Suitable conditions are those which will facilitate accurate inspection and weighing, maintain the quantity and the quality of the grain that is to be officially inspected or weighed, and not be hazardous to the health and safety of official personnel, as prescribed in the instructions.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Timely arrangements.</E> Requests for official service shall be made in a timely manner; otherwise, official personnel may not be available to provide the requested service.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Grounds for refusal.</E> Any or all services available to an applicant under the Act may be refused, either temporarily or indefinitely, by the Service for causes prescribed in section 10(a) of the Act. Such refusal by the Service may be restricted to the particular facility or applicant (if not a facility) found in violation or to a particular type of service, as the facts may warrant. Such action may be in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal penalties or other remedial action authorized by the Act.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Provision and procedure for summary refusal.</E> The Service may, without first affording the applicant (hereafter in this section “respondent”) a hearing, refuse to provide official inspection and Class X or Y weighing services pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause, as prescribed in section 10 of the Act, for refusing such official services and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official services system under the Act: <E T="03">Provided that</E> within 7 days after refusal of such service, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Pending final determination, the Service may terminate the temporary refusal if alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the respondent.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure for other than summary refusal.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, before the Service refuses to provide official services the respondent shall be (1) notified of the services that are to be refused, the locations at which and the time period for which service will be refused, and the reasons for the refusal; and (2) afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR 1.130 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). At the discretion of the Service, prior to initiation of formal adjudicatory proceedings, the respondent may be given an opportunity to express his or her views on the action proposed by the Service in an informal conference before the Administrator of the Service. If, as a result of such an informal conference, the Service and the respondent enter into a consent agreement, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Assessment of civil penalties.</E> Any person who has knowingly committed any violation of section 13 of the Act or has been convicted of any violation of other Federal law with respect to the handling, weighing, or official inspection of grain may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed the amount specified at § 3.91(b)(6)(viii) of this title for each such violation as the Administrator determines is appropriate to effect compliance with the Act. Such action may be in addition to, or in lieu of, criminal penalties under section 14 of the Act, or in addition to, or in lieu <PRTPAGE P="487"/>of, the refusal of official services authorized by the Act.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Provisions for civil penalty hearings.</E> Before a civil penalty is assessed against any person, such person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Collection of civil penalties.</E> Upon failure to pay the civil penalty, the Service may request the Attorney General to file civil action to collect the penalty in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In any sale, offer for sale, or consignment for sale, which involves the shipment of grain in interstate or foreign commerce, the description of grain, as being of a grade in any advertising, price quotation, other negotiation of sale, contract of sale, invoice, bill of lading, other document, or description on bags or other containers of the grain, is prohibited if such description is other than by an official grade designation, with or without additional information as to specified factors. An official grade designation contains any of the following: The term “U.S.,” the numerals 1 through 5, the term “Sample grade,” or the name of a subclass or a special grade of grain specified in the Official United States Standards for Grain.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Proprietary brand names or trademarks.</E> A description of grain by a proprietary brand name or a trademark that does not resemble an official grade designation will not be considered to be a description by grade; but a description by a proprietary brand name or trademark that contains singly or in combination any of the terms referenced in paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered to resemble an official grade designation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of one or more factor designations.</E> In interstate commerce, a description of grain by the use of one or more grade factor designations which appear in the Official United States Standards for Grain or by other criteria will not be considered to be a description by grade.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">False or misleading descriptions.</E> In any sale, offer for sale, or consignment for sale of any grain which involves the shipment of grain from the United States to any place outside thereof, knowingly using a false or misleading description of grain by official grade designation, or other description is prohibited.</P>

                <P>(a) The use of an official grade designation, with or without factor information, or of official criteria information, or of the term “official grain standards,” shall not, without additional information, be considered to be a representation that the grain was officially inspected.</P>

For the purposes of this paragraph, adequate notice is written or oral notice given to an agency or the Service, as applicable, before official personnel begin to perform official inspection or weighing services. If oral notice is given, it must be confirmed in writing within 2 business days. To be adequate, the notice must explain the nature and extent of the action or practice in question and must identify the grain, stowage container, equipment, facility, and the official personnel actually or potentially involved.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purpose of this section, dockage and foreign material in grain shall be:</P>
                <P>(1) Defined for export elevators at export port locations as set forth in 7 CFR part 810 and as dust removed from grain and collected in a bin/container and as dust settling on floors, equipment, and other areas, commonly referred to as dust sweepings; and</P>
                <P>(2) Defined for other than export elevators as set forth in 7 CFR part 810.</P>

                <P>(2) Blend different kinds of grain except when such blending will result in grain being designated as Mixed grain in accordance with subpart E of the Official United States Standards for Grain.</P>
                <P>(3) Add water to grain for purposes other than milling, malting, or similar processing operations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> (1) The Administrator may grant exemptions from paragraph (b) of this section for grain shipments sent directly to a domestic end-user or processor. Requests for exemptions shall be submitted by grain handlers to the Service through the domestic end-users or processors or their representatives.</P>
                <P>(2) Grain sold under an exemption shall be consumed or processed into a product(s) by the purchaser and not resold into the grain market.</P>
                <P>(3) Products or byproducts from grain sold under an exemption shall not be blended with or added to grain in commercial channels, except for vegetable oil which may be used as a dust suppressant in accordance with (d)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Paragraph (b) shall not be construed as prohibiting the following grain handling practices. Compliance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section does not excuse compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Blending.</E> Grain of the same kind, as defined by the Official United States Standards for Grain, may be blended to adjust quality.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Assessment and use of fees.</E> (1) Fees assessed by an agency for official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing services or testing of inspection equipment shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory.</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of a State or local governmental agency, fees shall not be used for any purpose other than to finance the cost of the official inspection and Class X or Class Y weighing service and inspection equipment testing service performed by the agency or the cost of other closely related programs administered by the agency.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Restriction.</E> Only fees that meet the requirements stated in this section and are approved by the Service as reasonable and nondiscriminatory may be charged by an agency.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Nondiscriminatory fees.</E> In determining if fees are nondiscriminatory, the Service will consider whether the fees are collected from all applicants for official service in accordance with the approved fee schedule. Charges for time and travel incurred in providing service at a location away from a specified service point shall be assessed in accordance with the approved fee schedule.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Schedule of fees to be established.</E> (1) Each agency shall establish a schedule of fees for official services which the agency is delegated or designated the authority to perform.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Official inspection and weighing services.</E> The fees shown in Schedule A of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to official inspection and weighing services performed by FGIS in the U.S. and Canada. The fees shown in Schedule B of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to official domestic inspection and weighing services performed by delegated States and designated agencies, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico. The fees charged to delegated States by the Service are set forth in the State's Delegation of Authority document. Failure of a delegated State or designated agency to pay the appropriate fees to the Service within 30 days after becoming due will result in an automatic termination of the delegation or designation. The delegation or designation may be reinstated by the Service if fees that are due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days of the termination.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Schedule A—Fees for official inspection and weighing services performed in the United States and Canada.</E> For each calendar year, FGIS will calculate <E T="03">Schedule A</E> fees as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Annual review of fees.</E> For each calendar year, starting with 2017, the Service will review the fees in Schedule A in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and publish fees effective January 1 of each year according to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Tonnage fees.</E> Tonnage fees will consist of the national tonnage fee and local tonnage fees and will be calculated and rounded to the nearest $0.001 per metric ton. All outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Field Offices in New Orleans, League City, Portland, and Toledo will be assessed the national tonnage fee plus the appropriate local tonnage fee. Export grain officially inspected and/or weighed by delegated States and official agencies, excluding land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, will be assessed the national <PRTPAGE P="491"/>tonnage fee only. The fees will be set according to the following:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">National tonnage fee.</E> The national tonnage fee is the national program administrative costs for the previous fiscal year divided by the average yearly tons of export grain officially inspected and/or weighed by delegated States and designated agencies, excluding land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, and outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Service during the previous 5 fiscal years.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Local tonnage fee.</E> The local tonnage fee is the Field Office administrative costs for the previous fiscal year divided by the average yearly tons of outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Field Office during the previous 5 fiscal years. The local tonnage fee is calculated individually for each Field Office.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating reserve.</E> In order to maintain an operating reserve not less than 3 and not more than 6 months, the Service will review the value of the operating reserve at the end of each fiscal year and adjust fees according to the following:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Less than 4.5 months.</E> If the operating reserve is less than 4.5 times the monthly operating expenses, the Service will increase all fees in Schedule A in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 2 percent for each $1,000,000, rounded down, that the operating reserve is less than 4.5 times the monthly operating expense, with a maximum increase of 5 percent annually. Except for fees based on tonnage or hundredweight, all fees will be rounded to the nearest $0.10.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Greater than 4.5 months.</E> If the operating reserve is greater than 4.5 times the monthly operating expenses, the Service will decrease all fees in Schedule A in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 2 percent for each $1,000,000, rounded down, that the operating reserve is greater than 4.5 times the monthly operating expense, with a maximum decrease of 5 percent annually. Except for fees based on tonnage or hundredweight, all fees will be rounded to the nearest $0.10.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Periodic review.</E> The Service will periodically review and adjust all fees in Schedules A and B in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, respectively, as necessary to ensure they reflect the true cost of providing and supervising official service. This process will incorporate any fee adjustments from paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

The maximum number of individual units that may be combined to form a composite grade <PRTPAGE P="497"/>analysis is 20 containers, 5 railcars, or 15 trucks. Composite analysis must be restricted to carriers inspected within the official service provider's area of responsibility.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Average grade.</E> Grain loaded in multiple carriers offered for inspection may be graded individually, then averaged for certification as a single lot, <E T="03">provided that:</E> the grain in each individual carrier is inspected and graded as an individual unit; the grain is found to be uniform in respect to odor, condition, and insect infestation; and sampling is performed at the individual loading location in a reasonably continuous operation. The maximum number of individual units that may be combined to form an average grade analysis is 20 containers, 5 railcars, or 15 trucks. Average grade analysis is restricted to carriers inspected within the official service provider's area of responsibility.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Multiple grade.</E> When grain in a carrier is offered for inspection as one lot and the grain is found to be not uniform in condition because portions of the grain are heating or have an odor, the grain in each portion will be sampled, inspected, and graded separately; but the results must be shown on one certificate. The certificate must show the approximate quantity or weight of each portion, the location of each portion in the carrier or container, and the grade of the grain in each portion. The requirements of this section are not applicable when an applicant requests that the grade of the entire carrier be based on a determination of heating or odor when only a portion of the carrier is found to be heating or have an odor.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Infested.</E> If any portion of grain in a lot is found to be infested, according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for Grain, the entire lot shall be considered infested. When grain in railcars or trucks with permanently enclosed tops is considered infested, the applicant for inspection shall be promptly notified and given the option of (i) receiving a grade certificate with a special grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (ii) fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">One certificate per carrier: exceptions.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, one official certificate must be issued for the inspection of the grain in each truck, trailer, truck/trailer(s) combination, container, railcar, barge, or similarly-sized carrier, or composite/average grade analysis on multiple carrier units. The requirements of this paragraph are not applicable:</P>
                <P>(1) When grain is inspected in a combined lot under § 800.85;</P>
                <P>(2) When grain is inspected under paragraph (d) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(3) When certification is at the option of the applicant in accordance with instructions.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Bulkhead lots.</E> If grain in a carrier is offered for official inspection as two or more lots and the lots are separated by bulkheads or other partitions, the grain in each lot shall be sampled, inspected, and graded separately in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. An official certificate shall be issued for each lot inspected. Each certificate shall show the term “Bulkhead Lot,” the approximate quantity or weight of the grain in the lot, the location of the lot in the carrier, and the grade of the grain in the lot.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Bottom not sampled.</E> If bulk grain offered for official inspection is at rest in a carrier or container and is fully accessible for sampling in an approved manner, except that the bottom of the carrier or container cannot be reached with each probe, the grain shall be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe. The grain in the resulting samples shall be inspected, graded, and certificated, except that each certificate shall show a statement, as specified in the instructions, indicating the depth probed. Any inspection which is based on a sample that does not represent the entire carrier or container does not meet the mandatory inspection requirements of section 5(a)(1) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Partial inspection—heavily loaded</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> When an “In” movement of bulk grain is offered for inspection at rest in a carrier or container and is <PRTPAGE P="498"/>loaded in such a manner that it is possible to secure only door-probe or shallow-probe samples, the container shall be considered to be “heavily loaded,” and the request for inspection either shall be dismissed or a partial inspection shall be made. If the request is for the inspection of an “Out” movement of grain, the request shall be dismissed on the grounds that the grain is not accessible for a correct “Out” inspection.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Certification procedure.</E> If a partial inspection is made, the grain will be sampled as thoroughly as possible with an approved probe and inspected, graded, and a “partial inspection—heavily loaded” certificate issued. The certificate shall show the words “Partial inspection—heavily loaded” in the space provided for remarks. The type of samples that were obtained shall be described in terms of “door probe” or “shallow probe.”</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Reinspection and appeal inspection procedure.</E> A request for a reinspection or an appeal inspection service on grain in a carrier or container that is certificated as “partial inspection—heavily loaded” shall be dismissed in accordance with § 800.48(a)(4).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Restriction.</E> No “partial inspection—heavily loaded” certificate shall be issued for sacked grain or any inspection other than the inspections described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section and § 800.85(h)(2).</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Part lots</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> If a portion of the grain in a carrier or container is removed, the grain that is removed and the grain remaining shall be considered separate lots. When an official inspection service is requested on either portion, the grain shall be sampled, inspected, graded, and a “part-lot” inspection certificate issued.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Grain remaining in carrier or container.</E> The certificate for grain remaining in a carrier or container shall show (i) the following completed statement: “Partly unloaded; results based on portion remaining in (show carrier or container identification),” (ii) the term “Part lot” following the quantity information, (iii) the identification of the carrier or container, and (iv) the estimated amount and location of the part lot.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Grain unloaded from carrier or container.</E> If grain is sampled by official personnel during unloading, the certificate for the grain that is unloaded shall show (i) the completed statement: “Part lot; results based on portion removed from (show carrier identification)” and (ii) the term “Part lot” following the quantity information. If the grain is not sampled by official personnel during unloading, the certificate may, upon request of the applicant, show a completed statement such as “Applicant states grain is ex-car ” or “Applicant states grain is ex-barge ,” but the certificate shall not otherwise show a carrier or container identification or the term “Part lot.”</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Identification for compartmented cars.</E> The identification for compartments in a compartmented railcar shall, in the absence of readily visible markings, be stated in terms of the location of the grain in a compartment, with the first compartment at the brake end of the car being identified as B-1, and the remaining compartments being numbered consecutively towards the other end of the car.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inspection procedure; general—land carriers and barges</E>—(1) <E T="03">Inspection during loading, or unloading, or at rest.</E> Grain in two or more land carriers or barges that are to be officially inspected as a combined lot, must be sampled in a reasonably continuous operation. Representative samples must be obtained from the grain in each individual carrier and inspected in accordance with procedures as prescribed in the instructions.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Recertification.</E> Grain that has been officially inspected and certified as two or more single, composite, or average quality lots may be recertified as a combined lot provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) The grain in each lot was sampled in a reasonably continuous operation;</P>
                <P>(ii) The original inspection certificates issued for the single, composite, or average quality lots have been surrendered to official personnel;</P>
                <P>(iii) Representative file samples of the single, composite, or average quality lots are available;</P>
                <P>(iv) The grain in the single, composite, or average quality lots is of the same grade or better grade and quality than as specified in the written instructions provided by the shipper;</P>
                <P>(v) Official personnel who performed the inspection service for the single, composite, or average quality lots and the official personnel who are to recertify the grain as a combined lot must determine that the samples used as a basis for the inspection of the grain in the single, composite, or average quality lots were representative at the time of sampling and have not changed in quality or condition; and</P>
                <P>(vi) The quality or condition of the grain meets uniformity requirements established by the Service for official inspection of grain in combined lots.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Weighted or mathematical average.</E> Official factor and official criteria information shown on a certificate for grain in a combined lot shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, be based on the weighted or mathematical averages of the analysis of the sublots in the lot and shall be determined in accordance with the instructions.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Infested grain.</E> If the grain in a combined lot is offered for official inspection as it is being loaded aboard a carrier and the grain, or a portion of the grain, in a lot is found to be infested, according to applicable provisions of the Official U.S. Standards for Grain, the applicant shall be notified and may exercise options specified in the instructions. When grain in railcars or trucks with permanently enclosed tops is considered infested, the applicant shall be given the option of (1) receiving a grade certificate with a special grade designation indicating that the entire lot is infested or (2) fumigating the grain in the lot in accordance with instructions and receiving a grade certificate without the special grade designation.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Grain uniform in quality.</E> Samples obtained from grain officially inspected as a combined lot shall be examined for uniformity of quality. If the grain in the samples is found to be uniform in quality and the grain is loaded aboard or is unloaded from the carriers in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in the combined lot shall be officially inspected and certificated as one lot. The requirements of this paragraph (f) and paragraph (c) of this section with respect to reasonably continuous loading or unloading do not apply to grain which is at rest in carriers when the grain is offered for inspection.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Grain not uniform in quality.</E> When grain officially inspected as a combined lot is found to be not uniform in quality or if the grain is not loaded or unloaded in a reasonably continuous operation, the grain in each portion, and any grain which is loaded or unloaded at different times, shall be officially sampled, inspected, graded, and certificated as single lots.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Special certification procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grain not uniform in quality.</E> When grain in a combined lot is found to be not uniform in quality under paragraph (g) of this section, the official inspection certificate for each portion of different quality shall show (i) the grade, identification, and approximate quantity of <PRTPAGE P="500"/>the grain and (ii) other information required by the instructions.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Partial inspection.</E> When an inbound movement of bulk grain is offered for official inspection at rest as a combined lot and all carriers are not fully accessible for sampling, the request for official inspection either shall be dismissed or a combined lot inspection shall be made on those carriers that are accessible. Those lots that are not accessible shall be handled in accordance with § 800.84. If the request is for an official inspection service on an outbound movement of grain at rest in a combined lot, the request shall be dismissed on the ground that the grain is not accessible for a correct “Out” inspection.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Official mark.</E> If grain in a combined lot is inspected for grade as it is being loaded aboard two or more carriers, upon request of the applicant, the following mark shall be shown on the inspection certificate: “Loaded under continuous official inspection” or “Loaded under continuous official inspection and weighing.”</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Combined-lot certification; general.</E> Each official certificate for a combined-lot inspection service must show the identification for the “combined lot” or, at the request of the applicant, the identification of each carrier in the combined lot. If the identification of each carrier is not shown, the statement “Carrier identification available on the official work record” must be shown on the inspection certificate in the space provided for remarks. The identification and any seal information for the carriers may be shown in the Remarks section on the reverse side of the inspection certificate, provided that the statement “See reverse side” is shown on the face of the certificate in the space provided for remarks, or on an additional page.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Recertification.</E> If a request for a combined-lot inspection service is filed after the grain has been officially inspected and certified as single, composite, or average quality lots, the combined-lot inspection certificate must show, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The date of inspection of the grain in the combined lot (if the single, composite, or average quality lots were inspected on different dates, the latest of the dates must be shown);</P>
                <P>(ii) A serial number other than the serial numbers of the official inspection certificates that are to be superseded;</P>
                <P>(iii) The location of the grain, if at rest, or the name(s) of the elevator(s) from which or into which the grain in the combined lot was loaded or unloaded;</P>
                <P>(iv) A statement showing the approximate quantity of grain in the combined lot;</P>
                <P>(v) A completed statement showing the identification of any superseded certificates; and</P>
                <P>(vi) If at the time of issuing the combined-lot inspection certificate the superseded certificates are not in the custody of the official personnel, a statement indicating that the superseded certificates have not been surrendered must be clearly shown in the space provided for remarks. If the superseded certificates are in the custody of official personnel, the superseded certificates must be clearly marked “Void.”</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Further combining.</E> After a combined-lot inspection certificate has been issued, there shall be no further combining and no dividing of the certificate.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> No combined-lot inspection certificate shall be issued (1) for any official inspection service other than as described in this section or (2) which shows a quantity of grain in excess of the quantity in the single lots.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Any interested person may request appeal inspection or Board appeal inspection services, except as provided for in § 800.86(c)(5). When more than one interested person requests an appeal inspection or Board appeal inspection service, the first person to file is the applicant of record. Only one appeal inspection may be obtained from any original inspection or reinspection service. Only one Board appeal inspection may be obtained from an appeal inspection. Board appeal inspections will be performed on the basis of the official file sample. Board appeal inspections are not available on stowage examination services.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Kind and scope of request.</E> An appeal inspection service is limited to the kind and scope of the original or reinspection service; or, in the case of a Board Appeal inspection service, the kind and scope of the appeal inspection service. If the request specifies a different kind or scope, the request shall be dismissed but may be resubmitted as a request for original services: Provided, however, that an applicant for service may request an appeal or Board Appeal inspection of a specific factor(s), official grade and factors, or official criteria. In addition, appeal and Board Appeal inspections for grade may include a review of any pertinent factor(s), as deemed necessary by official personnel. Official criteria are considered separately from official grade or official factors when determining kind and scope. When requested, an appeal inspection for grade, or official factors, and official criteria may be handled separately even though both results are reported on the same certificate. Moreover, an appeal inspection may be requested on the inspection results when both inspection and Class X weighing results are reported on a combination inspection and Class X weight certificate.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Requests shall be filed with the field office responsible for the area in which the original service was performed. Requests for Board appeal inspections may be filed with the Board of Appeals and Review or the field office that performed the appeal inspection. All requests shall include the information specified in § 800.46. Verbal requests shall be confirmed in writing when requested by official personnel as specified in § 800.46. Copies of request forms may be obtained from the field office upon request. If at the time the request is filed the documentation required by § 800.46 is not available, official personnel may, at their discretion, withhold service pending the receipt of the required documentation. An appeal inspection certificate will not be issued unless (1) documentation requested under § 800.46 has been submitted or (2) office personnel determine that sufficient information has been made available so as to perform the request. A record that sufficient information has been made available must be included in the record of the official service.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Filing requirements.</E> Requests will be considered filed on the date they are received by official personnel. A record shall be maintained for all requests. Requests must be filed (1) before the grain has left the specified service point where the grain was located when <PRTPAGE P="518"/>the original inspection was performed, (2) no later than the close of business on the second business day following the date of the last inspection, and (3) before the identity of the grain has been lost. If a representative file sample as prescribed in § 800.82 is available, official personnel may waive the requirements pursuant to this paragraph. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be waived only upon written consent of the applicant and all interested persons. The requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section may be waived at the request of the applicant or other interested persons. The requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may also be waived upon satisfactory showing by an interested person of evidence of fraud or that because of distance or other good cause, the time allowed for filing was not sufficient. A record of each waiver shall be included in the record of the appeal inspection service.</P>

Such action shall be effective upon receipt of notice from the Service by the respondent. Within 30 calendar days after issuing a notice of summary action, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c) of this section.

The term shall not include (1) the occasional exchange of a cup of coffee or similar social courtesies of nominal value in a business or work relationship if the exchange is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; (2) the acceptance of unsolicited advertising material such as pencils, pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the exchange of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal relationship (including those between official personnel and their parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work relationship.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Conflicts.</E> In addition to the conflicts of interest prohibited by section 11 of the Act, the activities specified in this paragraph shall also be considered <PRTPAGE P="535"/>to be a conflict of interest. Accordingly, no official personnel shall, during the term of their license or authorization (including any period of suspension):</P>
                <P>(1) Accept any gratuity.</P>
                <P>(2) Accept any fee or charge or other thing of monetary value, in addition to the published fee or charge, for the performance of official inspection or weighing services under circumstances in which the acceptance could result, or create the appearance of resulting, in (i) the use of their office or position for undue private gain, (ii) an undertaking to give undue preferential treatment to any group or any person, or (iii) any other loss of independence or impartiality in the performance of official inspection or Class X or Class Y weighing services.</P>
                <P>(3) Knowingly perform, or participate in performing, an inspection or weighing service on grain in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest.</P>
                <P>(4) Engage in the business by buying, selling, transporting, cleaning, elevating, storing, binning, mixing, blending, drying, treating, fumigating, or other preparation of grain (other than a grower of grain, or in the disposition of inspection samples); or in the business of cleaning, treating, or fitting carriers or containers for transporting or storing grain; the merchandising for nonfarm use of equipment for cleaning, drying, treating, fumigating, or otherwise processing, handling, or storing grain; or the merchandising of grain inspection or weighing equipment (other than buying or selling by official personnel of the equipment for use in the performance of their official services).</P>
                <P>(5) Seek or hold any appointive or elective office in a grain industry organization or association. This provision does not apply to organizations of official inspectors or official weighers.</P>
                <P>(6) Participate in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of corporate stocks or bonds, grain or grain-related commodities, or other property for speculative or income purposes if the transaction could reasonably be construed to interfere with the proper and impartial performance of official inspection for Class X or Class Y weighing services. Official personnel are not prohibited from (i) producing grain as a grower and selling the grain; (ii) making bona fide investments in governmental obligations, banking institutions, savings and loan associations, and other tangibles and intangibles that are clearly not involved in the production, transportation, storage, marketing, or processing of grain; or (iii) borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Reports of interests.</E> Official personnel shall report information regarding their employment or other business or financial interests which may be required by the Service.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Avoiding conflicts of interest.</E> Official personnel shall not acquire any financial interest or engage in any activity that would result in a violation of this § 800.187, or § 800.186, or section 11 of the Act and shall not permit their spouses, minor children, or blood relatives who reside in their immediate households to acquire any such interest or engage in any such activity. For the purpose of this section, the interest of a spouse, minor child, or blood relative who is a resident of the immediate household of official personnel shall be considered to be an interest of the official personnel.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Disposing of a conflict of interest</E>—(1) <E T="03">Remedial action.</E> Upon being informed that a conflict of interest exists and that remedial action is required, an applicant for a license and official personnel shall take immediate action to end the conflict of interest and inform the Service of the action taken.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Hardship cases.</E> Applicants and official personnel who believe that remedial action will cause undue personal hardship may request an exception by forwarding to the Service a written statement setting forth the facts, circumstances, and reasons for requesting an exception.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to terminate.</E> If a final determination is made by the Service that a conflict of interest does exist and should not be excepted, failure to terminate the conflict of interest shall subject: (i) An applicant for a license to a dismissal of the application; (ii) An employee of the Service to disciplinary <PRTPAGE P="536"/>action; and (iii) A licensee to license revocation.</P>

              <P>(a) The requirements set forth in this part 802 describe certain specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for grain weighing equipment and related grain handling systems used in performing Class X and Class Y weighing services, official inspection services, and commercial services under the Act. All scales used for official grain weight and inspection certification services provided by FGIS must meet applicable requirements contained in the FGIS Weighing Handbook, the General Code, the Scales Code, the Automatic Bulk Weighing Systems Code, and the Weights Code of the 2008 edition of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 44, “Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices” (Handbook 44); and NIST Handbook 105-1 (1990 Edition), “Specifications and Tolerances for Reference Standards and Field Standard Weights and Measures,” (Handbook 105-1). These requirements are confirmed to be met by having National Type Evaluation Program type approval. Scales used for commercial purposes will be required to meet only the applicable requirements of the 2008 edition of the NIST Handbook-44. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a), with the exception of the Handbook 44 requirements listed in paragraph (b), the materials in Handbooks 44 and 105-1 are incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of approval and a notice of any change in these materials will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register on March 8, 2011, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The NIST Handbooks are for sale by the National Conference of Weights and Measures (NCWM), 1135 M Street, Suite 110, Lincoln, Nebraska 68508.

                  <P>Unless otherwise stated, the definitions in this section apply to all grains. All other definitions unique to a particular grain are contained in the appropriate subpart for that grain.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Distinctly low quality.</E> Grain that is obviously of inferior quality because it is in an unusual state or condition, and that cannot be graded properly by use of other grading factors provided in the standards. Distinctly low quality includes the presence of any objects too large to enter the sampling device; i.e., large stones, wreckage, or similar objects.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Moisture.</E> Water content in grain as determined by an approved device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.</P>

                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Test Weight per bushel.</E> The weight per Winchester bushel (2,150.42 cubic inches) as determined using an approved device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions. Test weight per bushel in the standards for corn, mixed grain, oats, sorghum, and soybeans is determined on the original sample. Test weight per bushel in the standards for barley, flaxseed, rye, sunflower seed, triticale, and wheat is determined after mechanically cleaning the original sample. Test weight per bushel is recorded to the nearest tenth pound for corn, rye, sorghum, soybeans, triticale, and wheat. Test weight per bushel for all other grains, if applicable, is recorded in whole and half pounds with a fraction of a half pound disregarded. Test weight per bushel is not an official factor for canola.</P>

                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Certain quality determinations.</E> Each determination of rodent pellets, bird droppings, other animal filth, broken glass, castor beans, cockleburs, crotalaria seeds, dockage, garlic, live insect infestation, large stones, moisture, temperature, an unknown foreign substance(s), and a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s) is made on the basis of the sample as a whole. When a condition exists that may not appear in the representative sample, the determination may be made on the basis of the lot as a whole at the time of sampling according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">All other determinations.</E> The basis of determination for all other factors is contained in the individual standards.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Rounding.</E> Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and are rounded as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.</P>
                  <P>(2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 5, retain the figure; e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3, and 1.22 as 1.2.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Recording.</E> The percentage of dockage in flaxseed and sorghum is reported in whole percent with fractions <PRTPAGE P="556"/>of a percent being disregarded. Dockage in barley and triticale is reported in whole and half percent with a fraction less than one-half percent being disregarded. Dockage in wheat and rye is reported in whole and tenth percents to the nearest tenth percent. Foreign material in sunflower seed is reported to the nearest one-half percent. Ranges of sunflower seed foreign material are reported as follows: 0.0 to 0.24 is reported as 0.0 percent, 0.25 to 0.74 as 0.5 percent, 0.75 to 1.24 as 1.0 percent, and the like. Foreign material and fines in mixed grain is reported in whole percent. The percentage of smut in barley, sclerotinia and stones in canola, and ergot in all grains is reported to the nearest hundredth percent. The percentage when determining the identity of all grains is reported to the nearest whole percent. Also reported to the nearest whole percent are the classes and subclasses in wheat; flint corn; flint and dent corn; waxy corn; classes in barley; and the percentage of each kind of grain in mixed grain. Plump barley shall be expressed in terms of the range in which it falls. Ranges shall be: Below 50 percent, 50 to 55 percent, 56 to 60 percent, 61 to 65 percent, and the like. All other percentages are reported in tenths percent.</P>

                <P>The Agricultural Marketing Service, (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and efficient marketing of agricultural products by maintaining voluntary grade standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, which provide a uniform language for describing the quality of these commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not limited to) terms, classes, quality levels, performance criteria, and inspection requirements. Procedures contained in this part set forth the process which AMS will follow in developing, issuing, revising, suspending, or terminating the U.S. standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils. Communications about AMS standards in general should be addressed to the Administrator, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-3601.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures for establishing and revising grade standards.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) AMS will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. AMS encourages interested parties to participate in the review, development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, trade associations, companies, and State or Federal agencies. Such persons may at any time recommend that AMS develop, revise, suspend, or terminate a grade standard. Requests for action should be in writing, and should be <PRTPAGE P="603"/>accompanied by a draft of the suggested change, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) AMS will:</P>
                <P>(1) Determine the need for new or revised standards;</P>
                <P>(2) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;</P>
                <P>(3) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as appropriate; and</P>
                <P>(4) Draft the proposed standards.</P>
                <P>(c) If AMS determines that new standards are needed, existing standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of existing standards is justified, AMS will undertake the action with input from interested parties.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 868.103</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Public notification of grade standards action.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) After developing a standardization proposal, AMS will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> proposing new or revised standards or suspending or terminating existing standards. The notice will provide a sufficient comment period for interested parties to submit comments.</P>
                <P>(b) AMS will simultaneously issue a news release about these actions, notifying the affected industry and general public. AMS will also distribute copies of proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to anyone it believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or local government agencies.</P>
                <P>(c) All comments received within the comment period will be made part of the public record maintained by AMS, will be available to the public for review, and will be considered by AMS before final action is taken on the proposal.</P>
                <P>(d) Based on the comments received, AMS's knowledge of standards, grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any other relevant information, AMS will decide whether the proposed actions should be implemented.</P>

                <P>(e) If AMS concludes that the changes as proposed or with appropriate modifications should be adopted, AMS will publish the final changes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a final notice. AMS will make the grade standards and related information available in printed form and electronic media.</P>

                <P>(f) If AMS determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or otherwise are not in the public interest, AMS will either publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise the proposal and again seek public input.</P>
