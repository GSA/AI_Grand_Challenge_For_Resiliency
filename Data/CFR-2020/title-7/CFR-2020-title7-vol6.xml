      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In addition to the definitions contained in the crop insurance contract, the following definitions apply for the purposes of the APH Coverage Program:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">APH.</E> Actual Production History.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Actual yield.</E> The yield per acre for a crop year calculated from the production records or claims for indemnities. The actual yield is determined by dividing total production (which includes harvested and appraised production) by planted acres for annual crops or by insurable acres for perennial crops.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjusted yield.</E> The transitional or determined yield reduced by the applicable percentage for lack of records. The adjusted yield will equal 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield, if no producer records are submitted; 80 percent, if records for one year are submitted; and 90 percent, if two years of records are submitted.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Appraised production.</E> Production determined by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the FCIC, or a company reinsured by the FCIC, that was unharvested but which reflected the crop's yield potential at the time of the appraisal. For the purpose of APH “appraised production” specifically excludes production lost due to uninsurable causes.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Approved APH yield.</E> A yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee and determined by the sum of the yearly actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields divided by the number of yields contained in the database. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual and or assigned yields. At least four yields will always exist in the database.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Assigned yield.</E> A yield assigned by FCIC in accordance with the crop insurance contract, if the insured does not file production reports as required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in the same manner as actual yields when calculating APH yields except for purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Base period.</E> Ten consecutive crop years (except peaches, which have a five-year base period) immediately preceding the crop year defined in the insurance contract for which the approved APH yield is being established (except for sugarcane, which begins the calendar year preceding the immediate previous crop year defined in the insurance contract).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Continuous production reports.</E> Reports submitted by a producer for each crop year that the unit was planted to the crop and for the most recent crop year in the base period.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Crop year.</E> Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for APH <PRTPAGE P="10"/>purposes the term does not include any year when the crop was not planted or when the crop was prevented from being planted by an insurable cause. For example, if an insured plants acreage in a county to wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the policy definition. If the land is summerfallowed the next calendar year, that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Database.</E> A minimum of four years up to a maximum of ten crop years of production data used to calculate the approved APH yield.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Determined yield (D-yield).</E> An estimated year for certain crops, which can be determined by multiplying an average yield for the crop (attained by using data available from The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or comparable sources) by a percentage established by the FCIC for each county.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Master yields.</E> Approved APH yields, for certain crops and counties as initially designated by the FCIC, based on a minimum of four crop years of production records for a crop within a county.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">New producer.</E> A person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of the production of the insured crop for more than two crop years.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Production report.</E> A written record showing the insured crop's annual production and used to determine the insured's yield for insurance purposes. The report contains yield history by unit, if applicable, including planted acreage for annual crops, insurable acreage for perennial crops, and harvested and appraised production for the previous crop years. This report must be supported by written verifiable records, measurement of farm stored production, or by other records of production approved by FCIC on an individual basis. Information contained in a claim for indemnity is considered a production report for the crop year for which the claim was filed.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Production Reporting Date (PRD).</E> The PRD is contained in the crop insurance contract and is the last date production reports will be accepted for inclusion in the database for the current crop year.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Transitional yield (T-Yield).</E> An estimated yield, for certain crops, generally determined by multiplying the ASCS program yield by a percentage determined by the FCIC for each county and provided on the actuarial table to be used in the APH yield calculation process when less than four consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields are available.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Verifiable records.</E> Contemporaneous records of acreage and production provided by the insured, which may be verified by FCIC through an independent source, and which are used to substantiate the acreage and production that have been reported on the production report.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Verifier.</E> A person authorized by the FCIC to calculate approved APH yields.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Yield variance tables.</E> Tables for certain crops that indicate unacceptable yield variations and yield trends which will require determination of the APH yield by the FCIC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Yield certification and acceptability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Production reports must be provided to the crop insurance agent no later than the production reporting date for the crop insured.</P>
              <P>(1) Production reports must provide an accurate account of planted acreage for annual crops or insurable acres for perennial crops, as well as harvested and appraised production by unit.</P>
              <P>(2) The insured must certify the accuracy of the information.</P>

              <P>(3) Production reported for more than one crop year must be continuous. A year in which no acreage was planted to the crop on a unit or no acreage was planted to a practice, type, or variety requiring an APH yield will not be considered a break in continuity. Assigned yields, at the discretion of the FCIC, may be used to maintain continuity of yield data of file. Production on uninsured (for those years a crop insurance policy under the Federal Crop Insurance Act is in effect) or uninsurable acreage (for other years of the period) will not be used to determine APH yield unless production from such acreage is commingled with production from insured or insurable acreage.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Production reports and supporting records are subject to audit or review to verify the accuracy of the information certified. Production and supporting records may be reviewed and verified if a claim for indemnity is submitted on the insured crop. The reported yield is subject to revision, if needed, so that the claim conforms to the records submitted at that time.</P>
              <P>(1) Inaccurate production reports or failure to retain acceptable records shall result in the verifier combining optional farm units and recomputing the approved APH yield. These actions shall be taken at any time after reporting or record discrepancies are identified and may result in reduction of the approved APH yield for any calendar year.</P>
              <P>(2) Records must be provided by the insured at the time of an audit, review, or as otherwise requested, to verify that the acreage and production certified are accurate. Records of any other person having shares in the insured crop, which are used by the insured to establish the approved APH yield, must also be provided upon request.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event acreage or production data certified by two or more persons sharing in the crop on the same acreage is different, the verifier shall, at the verifier's discretion, determine which acreage and production data, if any, will be used to determine the approved APH yield. If the correct acreage and production cannot be determined, the data submitted will be considered unacceptable by the verifier for APH purposes.</P>
              <P>(4) Failure of the producer to report acreage and production completely and accurately may result in voidance of the crop insurance contract, as well as criminal or civil false claims penalties pursuant to applicable Federal criminal or civil statutes.</P>

              <P>(a) The insured is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete production reports to the agent. Production reports must be provided for all planted units.</P>
              <P>(b) Records may be requested by the FCIC, or an insurance company reinsured by the FCIC, or by anyone acting on behalf of the FCIC or the insurance company. The insured must provide such records upon request.</P>
              <P>(c) The agent will explain the APH Program to insureds and prospective insureds. When necessary, the agent will assist the insured in preparation of production reports. The agent will determine the adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields in accordance with § 400.54(b). The agent will review the production reports and forward them to the verifier, along with any requested and required supporting records for determination of an approved APH yield.</P>
              <P>(d) The verifier will determine if the certified production reports are acceptable and calculate the approved APH yield.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Qualification for actual production history coverage program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The approved APH yield is calculated from a database containing a minimum of four yields and will be updated each subsequent crop year. The database may contain a maximum of the 10 most recent crop years and may include actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields. T or D-Yields, adjusted or unadjusted, will only occur in the database when there are less than four years of actual and/or assigned yields.</P>
              <P>(b) The insured may be required to provide production records to determine the approved APH yield, if production records for the most recent crop year are available. If acceptable records of actual production are provided, the records must be continuous and contain at least the most recent crop year's actual yield.</P>
              <P>(1) If no acceptable production records are available, the approved APH yield is the adjusted T or D-Yield (65 percent of T or D-Yield).</P>

              <P>(2) If acceptable production records containing information for only the most recent crop year are provided, the three T or D-Yields adjusted by 80 percent will be used to complete the minimum database and calculate the approved APH yield.<PRTPAGE P="12"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If acceptable production records containing information for only the two most recent crop years are provided, the two T or D-Yields adjusted by 90 percent and the two actual yields will be used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.</P>
              <P>(4) If acceptable production records containing information for only the three most recent crop years are provided, the three actual yields and one unadjusted T or D-Yield are used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.</P>
              <P>(5) When the database contains four or more (up to ten) continuous actual yields, the approved APH yield is a simple average of the actual yields.</P>
              <P>(6) New producers may have their approved APH yields based on unadjusted T or D-Yields or a combination of actual and unadjusted T or D-Yields.</P>
              <P>(7) Producers who add land or new practice, types and varieties to their farming operations and who do not have available records for the added land, practice, types or varieties may have approved APH yields for the added land, practice, types or varieties that are based on adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields as determined by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(8) If the producer's crop is destroyed or if it produces a low actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting average yield may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to FCIC guidelines. APH yields qualifying for catastrophic yield adjustment may be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic years. Premium rates for approved APH yields, which are adjusted for catastrophic years, may be based on the producer's APH average yield prior to the catastrophic adjustment or such other basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(c) If no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted for a year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain the continuity of production reports for APH record purposes and that calendar year will not be included in the APH yield calculations.</P>
              <P>(d) Actual yields calculated from the claim for indemnity will be entered in the database. The resulting average yield will be used to determine the premium rate and approved APH yield, at the discretion of FCIC.</P>
              <P>(e) Optional units are not available to an insured who does not provide acceptable production reports for at least the most recent crop year with which to calculate an approved APH yield.</P>
              <P>(f) FCIC may determine approved APH yields for designated crops in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(1) If less than four years of yield history is certified and T or D-Yields are not provided in the actuarial documents,</P>
              <P>(2) If actual yield exceed tolerances specified in yield variance tables, and</P>
              <P>(3) For perennial crops:</P>
              <P>(i) If significant upward or downward yield trends are indicated;</P>
              <P>(ii) If tree or vine damage, or cultural practices will reduce the production level;</P>
              <P>(iii) If more than two percent of the trees or vines have been removed within the last two years; or</P>
              <P>(iv) If yield trends are evident and yields greater than the average yield are requested by the insured.</P>
              <P>(g) APH yields will not be approved the first insurance year on perennial crops until an inspection acceptable to FCIC has been performed and the acreage is accepted for insurance purposes in accordance with the crop insurance contract.</P>
              <P>(h) APH Master Yields may be established whenever crop rotation requirements and land leasing practices limit the yield history available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which Master Yields are available. To qualify, the producer must have at least four recent continuous crop years' annual production reports and must certify the authenticity of the production reports of the insured crop. Master Yields are based on acreage and production history from all acreage of the insured crop in the county in which the operator has shared in the crop's production.</P>
              <P>(i) FCIC may use any production report available under the provisions of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous or not, involving the interests of the person's insured crops in determining the approved APH yield.</P>

              <P>(1) Adverse decisions made by personnel of the Agency with respect to:</P>
              <P>(i) Contracts of insurance insured by FCIC; and</P>

              <P>(b) This subpart is not applicable to any decision:</P>
              <P>(1) Made by the Agency with respect to any matter arising under the terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement with the reinsured company; or</P>
              <P>(2) Made by any private insurance company with respect to any contract of insurance issued to any producer by the private insurance company and reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of the Act, except for determinations of good farming practices specified in § 400.91(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to matters identified in § 400.91(a)(1), participants may request an administrative review, mediation, or both, or appeal of adverse decisions by the Agency made with respect to:</P>
              <P>(1) Denial of participation in the crop insurance program;</P>

              <P>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision, this subpart does not apply to any decision made by the Agency that is generally applicable to all similarly situated program participants. Such decisions are also not appealable to NAD. If the Agency determines that a decision is not appealable because it is a matter of general applicability, the participant must obtain a review by the Director of NAD in accordance with 7 CFR 11.6(a) of the Agency's determination that the decision is not appealable before the participant may file suit against the Agency.</P>

              <P>(c) An appellant who chooses mediation must request mediation not later than 30 calendar days from receipt of the written notice of the adverse decision. A request for mediation will be considered to have been “filed” when personally delivered in writing to the appropriate decision maker or when the properly addressed request, postage paid, is postmarked.</P>
              <P>(d) An appellant will have any balance of the days remaining in the 30-day period to appeal to NAD if mediation is concluded without resolution. If a new adverse decision that raises new matters or relies on different grounds is issued as a result of mediation, the participant will have a new 30-day period for appeals to NAD.</P>

              <P>(e) An appellant is responsible for contacting the Certified State Mediation Program in States where such mediation program exists. The State mediation program will make all arrangements for the mediation process. A list of Certified State Mediation Programs is available at <E T="03">http://www.act.fcic.usda.gov.</E>

              <P>(f) An appellant is responsible for making all necessary contacts to arrange for mediation in non-certified States or in certified States that are not currently offering mediation on the subject in dispute. An appellant needing mediation in States without a certified mediation program may request mediation by contacting the RSO, which will provide the participant with a list of acceptable mediators.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Salary offset.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Debt collection by salary offset is feasible if: the cost to the Government of collection by salary offset does not exceed the amount of the debt; there are no legal restrictions to the debt, such as the debtor being under the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court or the expiration of a statute of limitations; or, other such legal restrictions. The Debt Collection Act permits collections of debts by offset for claims that have not been outstanding for more than 10 years.</P>
              <P>(b) The salary offset provisions contained herein provide procedures which must be followed before FCIC may request another Federal agency to offset any amount from the debtor's salary. Decisions made under the provisions of this section are not appealable under the provisions of the Appeal Regulations in part 400, subpart J of this title.</P>
              <P>(c) These regulations will not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for by another statute as noted by the Comptroller General in 64 Comp. Gen. 142 (1984), including 5 U.S.C. 5512(a), 5 U.S.C. 5513, 5 U.S.C. 5522(a) (1), 5 U.S.C. 5705 (1) and (2), and 5 U.S.C. 5724(f).</P>
              <P>(d) Salary offset may be used by FCIC to collect debts which arise from delinquent FCIC premium payments or delinquent repayment plans and other debts arising from, but not limited to, such sources as program theft, embezzlement, fraud, salary overpayments, underwithholding of any amounts due and payable for life and health insurance, advance travel payments, overpaid indemnities, and any amount owed by present or former employees from loss of federal funds through negligence and other matters. The debt does not have to be reduced to judgment and does not have to be covered by a security instrument.</P>
              <P>(e) FCIC may use salary offset against one of its employees who is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. Salary offset will not be initiated until after other servicing options available to the requesting agency have been utilized, and due process has been afforded to the FCIC employee. When salary offset is utilized, payment for the debt will be deducted from the employee's salary and sent directly to the creditor agency. Not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the employee's disposable salary can be offset in any one pay period, unless the employee agrees in writing to the deduction of a larger amount.</P>
              <P>(f) When FCIC is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, the other agency shall not initiate the requested offset until FCIC provides the agency with a written certification that the debtor owes FCIC a debt (including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of the payment), and that FCIC has complied with Department regulations. If a repayment schedule is elected by the employee, interest will be charged in accordance with Departmental Regulation 2520-1, Interest Rate on Delinquent Debts; USDA Debt Collection Regulations in 7 CFR part 3; and 4 CFR 102.13.</P>
              <P>(g) For the purposes of this section, the Manager, FCIC, or the Manager's designee, is delegated authority to:</P>
              <P>(1) Certify to the debtor's employing agency that the debt exists and the amount of the debt or delinquent balance;</P>

              <P>(2) Certify that, with respect to debt collection, the procedures and regulations of FCIC and the Department have been complied with; and<PRTPAGE P="21"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Request that salary offset be initiated by the debtor's employing agency.</P>

              <P>(d) An explanation of the requirements concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, including a statement that these assessments will be made unless waived in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 7 CFR 3.34;</P>
              <P>(e) That FCIC's records concerning the debt are available to the employee for inspection and that the employee may request a copy of such records;</P>
              <P>(f) That the employee has a right to voluntarily enter into a written agreement with FCIC for a repayment schedule with FCIC, which may be different from that proposed by FCIC, if the terms of the repayment agreement are agreed to by FCIC;</P>
              <P>(g) That the employee has the right to a hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge of USDA, or a hearing official not under the control of USDA, concerning the determination of the debt, the amount of the debt, or the percentage of disposable salary to be deducted each pay period, if the petition for a hearing is filed by the employee as prescribed by FCIC;</P>

              <P>(k) That any knowingly false or frivolous statement, representation, or evidence may subject the employee to:</P>
              <P>(1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable Statutes or regulations;</P>
              <P>(2) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or any other applicable statutory authority: or</P>
              <P>(3) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or any other applicable statutory authority;</P>
              <P>(l) Any other rights or remedies available to the employee under any statute or regulations governing the program for which collection is being made;</P>
              <P>(m) That the employee may request waiver of salary overpayment under applicable statutory authority (5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C 716, or 5 U.S.C 8346(b)), or may request waiver in the case of general debts and if waiver is available under any statutory provision pertaining to the particular debt being collected. The employee may question the amount or validity of the salary overpayment or general debt by submitting a claim to the Comptroller General in accordance with General Accounting Officer procedure.</P>
              <P>(n) That amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not to be owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee, unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary; and</P>
              <P>(o) The name and address of an official of FCIC to whom the employee should direct any communication with respect to the debt.</P>

              <P>Under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720A, the (IRS) may be requested to <PRTPAGE P="24"/>collect a legally enforceable debt owing to any Federal agency by offset against a taxpayer's Federal income tax refund. This section provides policies and procedures to implement IRS tax refund offsets in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 301.6402-6T of 26 CFR chapter I.</P>
              <P>(a) Any person who is indebted to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is entitled to the extent of FCIC's administrative due process including review and appeal of the debt under the Appeal Regulations in 7 CFR part 400, subpart J.</P>
              <P>(b) If, after such administrative due process is exhausted, the debt is still outstanding with no other means of collection, the debtor will be notified by letter of FCIC's intention to refer such debt to the IRS for collection by tax refund offset. The notification letter will inform the debtor that their account is delinquent and that IRS will be requested to reduce the amount of any tax refund check due the debtor by the amount of the deliquency. The debtor will be given 60 days in which to write to the Manager, FCIC, providing written evidence that the debt is not legally enforceable. FCIC will refer the debt to IRS for collection by offset after the 60-day period if no response is received from the debtor. Decisions made under the provisions of this section are not appealable under the provisions of the Appeal Regulations in 7 CFR part 400, subpart J.</P>
              <P>(c) If the debtor has requested a review, and has provided written evidence that the debt is not legally enforceable, the Manager, with the assistance of the Office of General Counsel, USDA, will review the debtor's reasons for believing that the debt is not legally enforceable. The debtor will then be notified of the results of the review.</P>
              <P>(d) FCIC will notify IRS of those accounts against which offset action is to be taken.</P>
              <P>(e) If, during the period of review, the debtor pays the debt in full, the collection of the debt by tax refund offset procedure will be halted. Changes in debtor status that eliminate the debtor from IRS offset will be reported to IRS by FCIC and the debtor's refund will not be offset.</P>
              <P>(f) Amounts offset for delinquent debt which are later found to be not owed to FCIC, will be promptly refunded.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initial selection criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Nonstandard classification procedures in this subpart initially apply when all of the following insurance experience criteria (including any applicable adjustment in § 400.303(d)) for the crop have been met:</P>
              <P>(1) Three (3) or more indemnified losses during the NCS base period;</P>
              <P>(2) Cumulative indemnities in the NCS base period that exceed cumulative premiums during the same period by at least $500;</P>
              <P>(3) The result of dividing the number of indemnified losses during the NCS base period by the number of years premium is earned for that period equals .30 or greater; and</P>
              <P>(4) Either of the following apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The natural logarithm of the cumulative earned premium rate multiplied by the square root of the cumulative loss ratio equals 2.00 or greater; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Five (5) or more indemnified losses have occurred during the NCS base period and the cumulative loss ratio equals or exceeds 1.50.</P>
              <P>(b) The minimum standards provided in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section may be increased in a specific county if that county's overall insurance experience for the crop is substantially different from the insurance experience for which the criteria was determined. The increased standard will apply until the conditions requiring the increase no longer apply. Any change in the standards will be contained in the Special Provisions for the crop.</P>
              <P>(c) Selection criteria may be applied on the basis of insurance experience of a person, insured acreage, or the combination of both.</P>
              <P>(1) Insurance experience of a person will include:</P>
              <P>(i) Insurance experience of the person;</P>
              <P>(ii) Insurance experience of other insured entities in which the person had substantial beneficial interest if the person was actively engaged in farming of the insured crop by virtue of the person's interest in those insured entities;</P>
              <P>(iii) Insurance experience of a spouse and minor children if the person is an individual and the spouse and minor children are considered the same as the individual under § 400.306.</P>
              <P>(2) Insurance experience of insured acreage includes all insurance experience during the base period resulting from the production of the insured crop on the acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) Where insurance experience is based on a combination of person and insured acreage, the insurance experience will include the experience of the person as defined in paragraph (b) of this section (1) only on the specific insured acreage during the base period.</P>
              <P>(d) Insurance experience for the crop will be adjusted, by county and crop year, to discount the effect of indemnities caused by widespread adverse growing conditions. Adjustments are determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine the average yield for the county using the annual county crop yields for the previous 20 crop years, unless such data is not available;</P>
              <P>(2) Determine the normal variability in the average yield for the county, expressed as the standard deviation;</P>
              <P>(3) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(2) from § 400.303(d)(1);</P>

              <P>(4) Divide the annual crop yield for the county for each crop year in the <PRTPAGE P="32"/>NCS base period by the result of § 400.303(d)(3), the result of which may not exceed 1.0;</P>
              <P>(5) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(4) for each crop year from 1.0;</P>
              <P>(6) Multiply the result of § 400.303(d)(5) by the liability for the crop year; and</P>
              <P>(7) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(6) from any indemnity for that crop year.</P>
              <P>(e) FCIC may substitute the crop yields of a comparable crop in determining § 400.303(d) (1) and (2), or may adjust the average yield or the measurement of normal variability for the county crop, or any combination thereof, to account for trends or unusual variations in production of the county crop or if the availability of yield and loss data for the county crop is limited. Information about how these determinations are made is available by submitting a request to the FCIC Regional Service Office for the producer's area. Alternate methods of determining the effects of adverse growing conditions on insurance experience may be implemented by FCIC if allowed in the Special Provisions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nonstandard Classification determinations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Nonstandard Classification determinations can affect a change in assigned yields, premium rates, or both from those otherwise prescribed by the insurance actuarial tables.</P>
              <P>(b) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of insured acreage (or of a person on specific insured acreage) will be based on the simple average of available actual yields from the insured acreage during the base period.</P>
              <P>(c) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of a person without regard to any specific insured acreage will be determined by an assigned yield factor calculated by multiplying excess loss cost ratio by loss frequency and subtracting that product from 1.00 where:</P>
              <P>(1) Excess loss cost ratio is total indemnities divided by total liabilities for all years of insurance experience in the base period and the result of which is then reduced by the cumulative earned premium rate, expressed as a decimal, and</P>
              <P>(2) Loss frequency is the number of crop years in which an indemnity was paid divided by the number of crop years in which premiums were earned during the base period.</P>
              <P>(d) Changes of premium rates will be made to reflect premium rates that would have resulted in insurance experience during the base period with a loss ratio of 1.00 but:</P>
              <P>(1) A higher loss ratio than 1.00 may be used for premium rate determinations provided that the higher loss ratio is applied uniformly in a county; and</P>
              <P>(2) If a Nonstandard Classification change has been made to current assigned yields, insurance experience during the base period will be adjusted to reflect the affects of changed assigned yields before changes of premium rates are calculated based on that experience.</P>
              <P>(e) Once selection criteria have been met in any year, Nonstandard Classification adjustments will be made from year to year until no further changes are necessary in assigned yields or premium rates under the conditions set forth in § 400.304(f). In determining whether further changes are necessary, the eligibility criteria will be recomputed each subsequent year using the premium rates and yields which would have been applicable had this part not been in effect.</P>
              <P>(f) Nonstandard Classification changes will not be made that:</P>
              <P>(1) Increase assigned yields or decrease premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables, or</P>
              <P>(2) Result in less than a 10 percent decrease in assigned yields or less than a 10 percent increase in premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables.</P>

              <P>(a) Assignment of a Nonstandard Classification of assigned yields, assigned yield factors, or premium rates shall be made on forms approved by the <PRTPAGE P="33"/>Corporation and included in the actuarial tables for the county.</P>
              <P>(b) Nonstandard classification assignment will be made each year, for the year identified on the assignment forms, and are not subject to change under the provisions of this subpart by the Corporation for that year when included in the actuarial tables for the county, except as a result of a request for reconsideration as provided in section 400.309, or as the result of appeals under 7 CFR part 11.</P>
              <P>(c) A nonstandard classification may be assigned to identified insurable acreage; a person; or to a combination of person and identified acreage for a crop or crop practice, type, variety, or crop option or amendment whereby:</P>
              <P>(1) Classifications assigned to identified insurable acreage apply to all acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage;</P>
              <P>(2) Classifications assigned to a person apply to all insurable acres of the insured crop on which the person and any entity in which the person has substantial beneficial interest is actively engaged in farming; and</P>
              <P>(3) Classifications assigned to a combination of a person and identified insurable acreage will only apply to those acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage on which the named person is actively engaged in producing such crop.</P>

Such remedies include civil fines and disqualifications under the authority of section 515(h) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1515(h)); government-wide suspension and debarment under the authority of 48 CFR part 9, 48 CFR part 409, and 2 CFR parts 180 and 417; and civil fines and assessments under the authority of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. 3801-3812).</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this subpart apply to all participants in the Federal crop insurance program, including but not limited to producers, agents, loss adjusters, approved insurance providers and their employees or contractors, as well as any other persons who may provide information to a program participant and meet the elements for imposition of one or more administrative remedies contained in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) Any remedial action taken pursuant to this subpart is in addition to any other actions specifically provided in applicable crop insurance policies, contracts, reinsurance agreements, or other applicable statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) This rule is applicable to any violation occurring on and after January 20, 2009.</P>
              <P>(e) The purpose of the remedial actions authorized in this subpart are for the protection of the public interest from potential harm from persons who have abused the Federal crop insurance program, maintaining program integrity, and fostering public confidence in the program.</P>

              <P>(ii) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of violation;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether and to what extent the person planned, initiated, or carried out the violation;</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether the person has accepted responsibility for the violation and recognizes the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for disqualification or civil fine;</P>
              <P>(v) Whether the person has paid all civil and administrative liabilities for the violation;</P>
              <P>(vi) Whether the person has cooperated fully with FCIC (In determining the extent of cooperation, FCIC may consider when the cooperation began and whether the person disclosed all pertinent information known to that person at the time);</P>
              <P>(vii) Whether the violation was pervasive within the organization;</P>
              <P>(viii) The kind of positions held by the persons involved in the violation;</P>

              <P>(ix) Whether the organization took prompt, appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence;<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
              </P>
              <P>(x) Whether the principals of the organization tolerated the offense;</P>
              <P>(xi) Whether the person brought the violation to the attention of FCIC in a timely manner;</P>
              <P>(xii) Whether the organization had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the violation occurred;</P>
              <P>(xiii) Whether the organization has taken appropriate disciplinary action against the persons responsible for the violation;</P>
              <P>(xiv) Whether the organization had adequate time to eliminate the violation that led to the cause for disqualification or civil fine;</P>
              <P>(xv) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.</P>

              <P>(d) With respect to the imputing of conduct:</P>
              <P>(1) The conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to that organization when such conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the violation is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.</P>
              <P>(2) The conduct of any organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, knows, or had reason to know of such conduct.</P>
              <P>(3) The conduct of one organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to another organization when such conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct.

              <P>(ii) If the person is an agent or insurance agency, the producers may cancel their policies sold and serviced by the disqualified agent and rewrite the policy with another agent.

              <SUBJECT>Insurance availability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If sufficient actuarial data are available, FCIC will offer catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverage plans of insurance to indemnify persons for FCIC insured or reinsured crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if the crop loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified in the applicable crop insurance policy.</P>
              <P>(b) Catastrophic risk protection coverage may be offered through approved insurance providers and through local offices of the Farm Service Agency specified by the Secretary. Additional coverage will only be offered through approved insurance providers unless there is not a sufficient number of approved insurance providers that offer such insurance within a service area.</P>
              <P>(c) A person must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection for the crop on all insurable acreage in the county in which the person has a share on or before the sales closing date designated by FCIC for the crop in the county in order to satisfy the linkage requirements unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.</P>
              <P>(d) For additional coverage, in areas where insurance is not available for a particular agricultural commodity that is insurable elsewhere, FCIC may enter into a written agreement with a person to insure the commodity, provided that the person has actuarially sound data relating to the production of the commodity that is acceptable to FCIC and that such written agreement is specifically allowed by the crop insurance regulations applicable to the crop.</P>
              <P>(e) Failure to comply with all provisions of the policy constitutes a breach of contract and may result in ineligibility for certain other farm program benefits for that crop year and any benefit already received must be refunded. If a producer breaches the insurance contract, the execution of a waiver of eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance will not be effective for the crop year in which the breech occurred.</P>

              <P>To be eligible for certain other program benefits under § 400.655 the following conditions will apply with respect to crops of economic significance if the producer does not execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.</P>

              <P>(a) If a producer planted a crop of economic significance in the preceding crop year, and does not intend to plant the same crop in the present crop year, the producer does not have to obtain insurance coverage or execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop in the present crop year to comply with the linkage requirements. However, if the producer later decides to plant that crop, the producer will be unable to obtain insurance after the sales closing date and must execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop to be eligible for benefits as specified in § 400.655. Failure to execute such a waiver will require the producer to refund any benefits already received under a program specified in § 400.655.<PRTPAGE P="47"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The producer is initially responsible to determine the crops of economic significance in the county. The insurance provider may assist the producer in making these initial determinations. However, these determinations will not be binding on the insurance provider. To determine the percentage value of each crop:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiply the acres planted to the crop times the producer's share, times the approved yield, and times the price;</P>
              <P>(2) Add the values of all crops grown by the producer (in the county); and</P>
              <P>(3) Divide the value of the specific crop by the result of paragraph (b)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) The producer may use the type of price, such as the current local market price, futures price, established price, highest amount of insurance, etc., for the price when calculating the value of each crop, provided that the producer uses the same type of price for all crops in the county.</P>
              <P>(d) The producer may be required to justify the calculation and provide adequate records to enable the insurance provider to verify whether a crop is of economic significance.</P>

              <P>(a) To participate in catastrophic risk protection, or additional coverage plans of insurance, a producer must submit an application for insurance on or before the applicable sales closing date.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to remain eligible for certain farm programs, as specified in § 400.655, a producer must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection on all crops of economic significance, if catastrophic risk protection is available in the county, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 400.654(a) that applications for insurance be submitted on or before the applicable sales closing date, FCIC may permit a producer to insure crops other than those specified on the application under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The producer must be unable to plant the intended crop or it is not practical to replant a failed crop before the final planting date. FCIC will take into consideration marketing windows when determining whether it was not practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(2) Conditions must exist to warrant allowing a producer to insure crops other than the intended crop.</P>
              <P>(3) The producer must submit an application for the substitute crop on or before the acreage reporting date for the substitute crop and pay any applicable administrative fee. A producer may not substitute a crop that the producer planted in the preceding crop year unless that crop was listed on a timely filed application for the current crop year.</P>
              <P>(4) If the producer plants a substitute crop that is a crop of economic significance, the producer must obtain CAT coverage, if available, to comply with the linkage requirements specified in § 400.655. The producer may not substitute a crop under this provision if the producer has signed or intends to sign a waiver for emergency crop loss assistance for the crop year.</P>
              <P>(5) The substitute crop must be planted on or before the final planting date or within the late planting period, if applicable, for the substitute crop.</P>
              <P>(6) Under no circumstances may a producer submit an application for additional coverage after the sales closing date for the substitute crop.</P>
              <P>(d) For all coverages, including catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverages, the producer must file a signed acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date. Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign.</P>

              <P>(e) Under catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf an operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the <PRTPAGE P="48"/>operator purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained in that acreage report.</P>

              <P>(2) For all other debts, the written payment agreement must be signed by both parties, the debtor and the insurance provider or FCIC, as applicable, on or before the due date specified in the notice to the person of the amount due to prevent an ineligible determination for a delinquent debt.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination and notification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The insurance provider must send a written notice of the debt to the person, including the time frame in which the debt must be paid, and provide the person with a meaningful opportunity to contest the amount or existence of the debt. Once a debtor has filed bankruptcy and the insurance provider is formally informed of such through the court or the debtor, no request for payment of the debt can be made, unless approved in writing by the Office of General Counsel. The debtor may be notified of the amount of debt and ineligibility for crop insurance.</P>
              <P>(1) The insurance provider shall evaluate the person's response, if any, and determine if the debt is owed and delinquent.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon request by FCIC, the insurance provider shall submit all documentation related to the debt to FCIC.</P>
              <P>(b) If an insurance provider or any other person has evidence that a person meets criteria set forth in § 400.679(a), (b), (c), (e) or (f), they must immediately notify FCIC.</P>
              <P>(c) After the insurance provider determines a person has met one or more of the criteria in § 400.679 and notifies FCIC, FCIC will issue and mail a Notice of Ineligibility to the person's last known address and to the insurance provider. Notices sent to such address will be conclusively presumed to have been received by that person.</P>
              <P>(d) The Notice of Ineligibility will state the criteria upon which the determination of ineligibility has been based, a brief statement of the facts to support the determination, the time period of ineligibility, and the right to appeal the determination to be placed on the ITS in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Ineligibility, the ineligible person may appeal FCIC's determination to be placed on ITS to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11. The existence and amount of the debt is determined by the insurance provider, not FCIC; therefore, those determinations are not appealable to the National Appeals Division.</P>
              <P>(f) If the person appeals FCIC's determination to be placed on ITS to the National Appeals Division, the insurance provider will be notified and provided with an opportunity to participate in the proceeding, if permitted by 7 CFR part 11.</P>

              <P>(g) No later than 60 days after the termination date, a missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of an overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice <PRTPAGE P="52"/>to the person of an amount due, as applicable, such ineligible person may request consideration for reinstatement from the Administrator, Risk Management Agency, in accordance with section 2 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8).</P>

              <P>(2) If the ineligible person is an individual:</P>
              <P>(i) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible person is the sole insured will terminate if the person is ineligible for any reason other than a controlled substance violation, or be void if the person is ineligible due to conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, and the person will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The ineligible person must be reported on all policies in which the ineligible person has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policy will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the ineligible person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683.</P>
              <P>(3) If the ineligible person is a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and is ineligible as a result of:</P>

              <P>(iv) Will not adequately protect the interests of producers.</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, forward the 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance, and the results of RMA's initial review, to the Board for its determination of completeness and quality.</P>

              <P>(1) Determine if the 508(h) submission is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the 508(h) submission is deemed to be complete for the start of the 120 day time-period for approval);</P>
              <P>(2) Unless the 508(h) submission makes non-significant changes to a policy or plan of insurance, or involves policy provisions that have already undergone expert review, forward the complete 508(h) submission to at least five expert reviewers to review the 508(h) submission:</P>
              <P>(i) Of the five expert reviewers, no more than one will be employed by the Federal Government, and none may be employed by any approved insurance provider or their representative; and</P>

              <P>(F) Follows sound, reasonable, and appropriate underwriting principles;</P>
              <P>(G) Will provide a new kind of coverage that is likely to be viable and marketable;</P>

              <P>(i) With respect to 508(h) submissions developed from approved concept proposals, the provisions in § 400.712(c)(1) shall apply; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Except for 508(h) submissions developed from concept proposals, if the 508(h) submission is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new 508(h) submission solely for the purpose of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action; and</P>
              <P>(4) For complete 508(h) submissions:</P>
              <P>(i) Request review by RMA to provide its assessment of whether the 508(h) submission:</P>

              <P>(1) Determine whether the concept proposal is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the concept proposal is deemed to be a complete concept proposal for the start of the 120 day time-period for approval);</P>
              <P>(2) If complete, forward the concept proposal to at least two expert reviewers with underwriting or actuarial experience to review the concept in accordance with section 522(b)(2) of the Act, this subpart, and Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs;</P>
              <P>(3) Return to the applicant any concept proposal the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination (If the concept proposal is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new concept proposal solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action);</P>
              <P>(4) Determine whether the concept proposal, if developed into a policy or plan of insurance would, in good faith, would meet the requirement of being likely to result in a viable and marketable policy consistent with section 508(h) (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);</P>
              <P>(5) At its sole discretion, determine whether the concept proposal, if developed into a policy or plan of insurance would meet the requirement of providing coverage:</P>
              <P>(i) In a significantly improved form;</P>

              <P>(7) Determine whether the concept proposal meets all other requirements imposed by the Board or as otherwise specified in Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs; and<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) Provide a date by which the 508(h) submission must be provided in consultation with the applicant.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon the Board's receipt of an index-based weather plan of insurance, the Board will:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine whether the index-based weather plan of insurance is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the index-based weather plan of insurance is deemed to be complete for the start of the 120-day time-period for approval);</P>
              <P>(2) If determined to be complete, contract with five expert reviewers and review the index-based weather plan of insurance in accordance with section 523(i) of the Act, this subpart, and Procedures Handbook 17050—Approved Procedures for Submission of Index-based Weather Plans of Insurance;</P>
              <P>(3) Return to the applicant any index-based weather plan of insurance the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination (if the index-based weather plan of insurance is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new index-based weather plan of insurance solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action); and</P>
              <P>(4) Give the highest priority for approval of index-based weather plans of insurance that provide a new kind of coverage for specialty crops and livestock commodities that previously had no available crop insurance, or have demonstrated a low level of participation under existing coverage.</P>

              <P>(1) First, consider policies or plans of insurance that address underserved commodities, including commodities for which there is no insurance;</P>
              <P>(2) Second, consider existing policies or plans of insurance for which there is inadequate coverage or there exists low levels of participation; and</P>
              <P>(3) Last, consider all policies or plans of insurance submitted to the Board that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) At any time an applicant may request a time delay after the 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance has been placed on the Board meeting agenda. The Board is not required to agree to such an extension.</P>
              <P>(1) With respect to 508(h) submissions from concept proposals approved by the Board for advanced payment, the applicant must provide good cause why consideration should be delayed.</P>
              <P>(2) Any requested time delay is not limited in the length of time unless a date is set by the Board by which all revisions to the 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance must be made. However, delays may make implementation of the 508(h) submission for the targeted crop year impractical or impossible as determined by the Board.</P>
              <P>(3) The time period during which the Board will make a decision to approve or disapprove the 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance shall be extended commensurately with any time delay requested by the applicant.</P>

A withdrawn 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance that is resubmitted will be deemed a new 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action.</P>

              <P>(j) The Board will render a decision on a 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance, with or without revision or give notice of intent to disapprove within 90 days after <PRTPAGE P="70"/>the date the 508(h) submission or index-based weather plan of insurance is considered complete by the Board, unless the Board agrees to a time delay in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(k) The Board may provide a notice of intent to disapprove a 508(h) submission if it determines:</P>
              <P>(1) The interests of producers and taxpayers are not protected, including but not limited to:</P>

              <P>(ii) The applicant has not presented sufficient documentation that the 508(h) submission will provide a new kind of coverage that is likely to be viable and marketable (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);</P>
              <P>(iii) Coverage would be similar to another policy or plan of insurance that has not demonstrated a low level of participation or does not contain a clear and identifiable flaw, and the producer would not significantly benefit from the 508(h) submission;</P>
              <P>(iv) The 508(h) submission may create adverse market distortions or adversely impact other crops or agricultural commodities if marketed;</P>

              <P>(viii) The 508(h) submission contains vulnerabilities that allow indemnities to exceed the value of the crop;</P>
              <P>(2) The premium rates are not actuarially appropriate;</P>
              <P>(3) The 508(h) submission does not conform to sound insurance and underwriting principles;</P>
              <P>(4) The risks associated with the 508(h) submission are excessive or it increases or shifts risk to another reinsured policy;</P>
              <P>(5) The 508(h) submission does not meet the requirements of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(6) The 90-day deadline under subsection (j) will expire before the Board has time to make an informed decision to approve or disapprove the 508(h) submission.</P>
              <P>(l) The Board may disapprove a concept proposal if it determines:</P>
              <P>(1) The concept, in good faith, will not likely result in a viable and marketable policy consistent with section 508(h);</P>
              <P>(2) At the sole discretion of the Board, the concept, if developed into a policy and approved by the Board, would not provide crop insurance coverage:</P>
              <P>(i) In a significantly improved form;</P>
              <P>(ii) To a crop or region not traditionally served by the Federal crop insurance program; or</P>

              <P>(1) The 508(h) submission may be eligible for a one-time payment of research and development costs and reimbursement of maintenance costs for up to four reinsurance years, as determined by the Board;</P>

              <P>(3) If the applicant elects at any time not to continue to maintain the 508(h) submission, it will automatically become the property of FCIC and the applicant will no longer have any property rights to the 508(h) submission and will not receive any user fees for the plan of insurance;</P>
              <P>(b) The Board approved procedures and time-frames must be followed, or research and development costs and maintenance costs may not be reimbursed.</P>
              <P>(1) After a 508(h) submission has been approved by the Board for reinsurance, to be considered for reimbursement of:</P>
              <P>(i) Research and development costs, the applicant must submit the total amount requested and all supporting documentation to FCIC by electronic method or by hard copy and such information must be received by FCIC on or before August 1 immediately following the date the 508(h) submission was released to approved insurance providers through FCIC's issuance system; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Maintenance costs, the applicant must submit the total amount requested and all supporting documentation to FCIC by electronic method or by hard copy and such information must be received by FCIC on or before <PRTPAGE P="75"/>August 1 of each year of the maintenance period.</P>

              <P>(c) Applicants submitting a concept proposal may request an advance payment of up to 50 percent of the projected total research and development costs, and after the applicant has begun research and development activities, the Board may, at its sole discretion, provide up to an additional 25 percent advance payment of the estimated research and development costs, if the requirements in the definition of advance payment are met and the additional advance payment is requested in accordance with Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs.</P>
              <P>(1) If a concept proposal is approved by the Board for advance payment, the applicant is responsible for independently developing a 508(h) submission that is complete as specified in this subpart by the deadline set by the Board.</P>

              <P>(2) If an applicant receives an advance payment for a portion of the expected research and development costs for a concept proposal that is developed into a 508(h) submission and determined by the Board to be complete, but the 508(h) submission is not approved by the Board following expert review, the Board will not:</P>
              <P>(i) Seek a refund of any advance payments for research and development costs; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Make any further research and development cost reimbursements associated with the 508(h) submission.</P>
              <P>(d) Under section 522 of the Act, there are limited funds available on an annual fiscal year basis to pay for reimbursements of research and development costs (including advance payments for concept proposals) and maintenance costs. Consistent with paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section if all applicants' requests for reimbursement of research and development costs (including advance payments for concept proposals) and maintenance costs in any fiscal year:</P>
              <P>(1) Do not exceed the maximum amount authorized by law, the applicants may receive the full amount of reimbursement determined reasonable by the Board; or</P>
              <P>(2) Exceed the amount authorized by law, each applicant's reimbursement determined reasonable by the Board will be determined by dividing the total amount of each individual applicant's reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section by the total amount of the aggregate of all applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (e) through (j) for the year and multiplying the result by the amount of reimbursement authorized under the Act.</P>

              <P>(e) The amount of reimbursement for research and development costs and maintenance costs requested by the applicant may be reduced as necessary when the requested amount is not commensurate with the complexity or the size of the area proposed to be covered.<PRTPAGE P="76"/>

Reimbursement may be limited or denied if the contractor is paid a salary or other compensation);</P>
              <P>(ii) Travel and transportation (One line per event, include the job title, destination, purpose of travel, lodging cost, mileage, air or other identified transportation costs, food and miscellaneous expenses, other costs, and the total cost);</P>

              <P>(xv) Local, State, or Federal taxes.</P>
              <P>(g) Requests for reimbursement of maintenance costs must be supported by itemized statements and supporting documentary evidence for each reinsurance year in the maintenance period.</P>

              <P>(iv) Any other activity that qualifies as maintenance.</P>
              <P>(h) Projected costs for research and development for concept proposals shall be based on a detailed estimate of the costs allowed in paragraph (f) of this section. Since costs are one measurement of the viability to develop an efficient policy, the Board may limit reimbursements for research and development to the estimated costs contained in the concept proposal, unless the submitter can justify a higher reimbursement in accordance with Board procedures.</P>
              <P>(i) If a 508(h) submission is determined to be incomplete and is subsequently resubmitted and approved, the costs to perfect the 508(h) submission may not be considered reimbursable costs depending on the level of insufficiency or incompleteness of the 508(h) submission, as determined at the sole discretion of the Board.</P>
              <P>(j) Reimbursement of costs associated with addressing issues raised by the Board, expert reviewers and RMA will be evaluated based on the substance of the issue and the amount of time reasonably necessary to address the specific issue. Delays and additional costs caused by the inability or refusal to adequately address issues may not be considered reimbursable, as determined at the sole discretion of the Board.</P>
              <P>(k) If the Board withdraws its approval for reinsurance at any time during the period that reimbursement for maintenance is being made or user fees are being collected, no maintenance reimbursement shall be made nor any user fee be owed after the date of such withdrawal.</P>
              <P>(l) Not later than 180 days prior to the end of the last reinsurance year in which a maintenance reimbursement will be paid for the approved 508(h) submission, the applicant must notify FCIC in writing regarding its decision on future ownership and maintenance of the policy or plan of insurance.</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant must notify FCIC in writing whether it intends to:</P>
              <P>(i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance and charge approved insurance providers a user fee to cover maintenance expenses for all policies earning premium; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Transfer responsibility for maintenance to FCIC.</P>
              <P>(2) If the applicant fails to notify FCIC in writing by the deadline, the policy or plan of insurance will automatically transfer to FCIC beginning with the next reinsurance year.</P>
              <P>(3) If the applicant elects to:</P>
              <P>(i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance, the applicant must submit a request for approval of the user fee by the Board at the time of the election; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Transfer the policy or plan of insurance to FCIC, FCIC may at its sole discretion, continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance or elect to withdraw the availability of the policy or plan of insurance.</P>
              <P>(4) Requests for approval of the user fee must be accompanied by written documentation to support the amount requested will only cover direct costs to maintain the plan of insurance. Costs that are not eligible for research and development and maintenance reimbursements under this section are not eligible to be considered for determining the user fee.</P>

              <P>(5) The Board will approve the amount of user fee, including the maximum amount of total maintenance that may be collected per year, that is payable to the applicant by approved <PRTPAGE P="78"/>insurance providers unless the Board determines that the user fee charged:</P>
              <P>(i) Is unreasonable in relation to the maintenance costs associated with the policy or plan of insurance; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Unnecessarily inhibits the use of the policy or plan of insurance by approved insurance providers.</P>
              <P>(6) If the total user fee exceeds the maximum amount determined by the Board, the maximum amount determined by the Board will be divided by the number of policies earning premium to determine the amount to be paid by each approved insurance provider.</P>
              <P>(7) Reasonableness of the initial request to charge a user fee will be determined by the Board based on a comparison of the amount of reimbursement for maintenance previously received, the number of policies, the number of approved insurance providers, and the expected total amount of user fees to be received in any reinsurance year.</P>
              <P>(8) A user fee unnecessarily inhibits the use of a policy or plan of insurance if it is so high that approved insurance providers will not sell the policy, or the user fee represents an unreasonable portion of the A&amp;O subsidy paid to the AIP such that it prevents the AIP from meeting its other obligations under the SRA.</P>
              <P>(9) The user fee charged to each approved insurance provider will be considered payment in full for the use of such policy, plan of insurance or rate of premium for the reinsurance year in which payment is made.</P>
              <P>(10) It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to collect such fees from an approved insurance provider and any indebtedness for such fees must be resolved by the applicant and approved insurance provider.</P>
              <P>(i) Applicants may request that FCIC provide the number of policies sold by each approved insurance provider.</P>
              <P>(ii) Such information will be provided not later than 90 days after such request is made or not later than 90 days after the requisite information has been provided to FCIC by the approved insurance provider, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(11) Every two years after approval of a user fee, or if the applicant has made a significant change to the approved 508(h) submission, applicants must submit documentation to the Board for review in determining if the user fee should be revised.</P>
              <P>(12) The Board may review the amount of the user fee at any time at its sole discretion.</P>
              <P>(m) The Board may consider information from the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Employment Cost Index, and any other information determined applicable by the Board, in making a determination whether to approve a 508(h) submission for reimbursement of research and development costs, maintenance costs, or user fees.</P>
              <P>(n) For purposes of this section, rights to, or obligations of, research and development cost reimbursement, maintenance cost reimbursement, or user fees cannot be transferred from any individual or entity unless specifically approved in writing by the Board.</P>
              <P>(o) Applicants requesting reimbursement for research and development costs, maintenance costs, or user fees, may present their request in person to the Board prior to consideration for approval.</P>
              <P>(p) Index-based weather plans of insurance are not eligible for reimbursement from FCIC for maintenance costs or research and development costs. Submitters of approved index-based weather plans of insurance may collect user fees from other approved insurance providers in accordance with Procedures Handbook 17050—Approved Procedures for Submission of Index-based Weather Plans of Insurance.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 400.713</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Non-reinsured supplemental (NRS) policy.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Unless otherwise specified by FCIC, any NRS policy that covers the same agricultural commodity as any policy reinsured by FCIC under the Act must be provided to RMA to ensure it does not shift any loss or risk that does not exist under the FCIC reinsured policy. Failure to provide such NRS policy or endorsement to RMA prior to its issuance shall result in the denial of reinsurance, A&amp;O subsidy, and risk subsidy on all underlying FCIC reinsured policies unless the underlying FCIC <PRTPAGE P="79"/>policy was sold by another AIP. If the underlying FCIC reinsured policy is sold by another AIP, the AIP that sold the NRS may be required to pay FCIC an amount equal to the reinsurance, A&amp;O subsidy, and risk subsidy on the underlying FCIC policy.</P>

              <P>(b) An electronic copy in Microsoft Office compatible format, of the new or revised NRS policy and related materials must be submitted at least 150 days prior to the first sales closing date applicable to the NRS policy. At a minimum, examples that demonstrate how liability and indemnities are calculated under differing scenarios must be included. Electronic copies of the NRS must be sent to the Deputy Administrator for Product Management (or successor) at <E T="03">DeputyAdministrator@rma.usda.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) RMA will review the NRS policy. If any of the conditions found in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section are found to occur, FCIC will notify the AIP that submitted the NRS policy that if they sell the NRS policy, it will result in denial of reinsurance, A&amp;O subsidy, and risk subsidy on all underlying FCIC reinsured policies, unless the underlying FCIC policy was sold by another AIP. If the underlying FCIC reinsured policy is sold by another AIP, the AIP that sold the NRS may be required to pay FCIC an amount equal to the reinsurance, A&amp;O subsidy, and risk subsidy on the underlying FCIC policy.</P>
              <P>(1) If the NRS policy materially increases or shifts risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(i) An NRS policy will be considered to materially increase or shift risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC if RMA determines it:</P>
              <P>(A) Creates a moral hazard, such as a financial incentive for the policyholder to behave in a way that increases the number or size of losses;</P>
              <P>(B) Results in the underlying FCIC policy either triggering a loss sooner, or paying a larger indemnity than would otherwise be allowed by the terms and conditions of the underlying reinsured policy; or</P>
              <P>(C) Allows for combined indemnities between the underlying FCIC reinsured policy and the NRS that are in excess of the value a producer would reasonably expect to receive for the insured commodity if a normal crop was produced and sold at a reasonable market price.</P>
              <P>(ii) The NRS must include language that clearly states no indemnity will be paid in excess of the initial value of the insured commodity.</P>
              <P>(2) The NRS reduces or limits the rights of the insured with respect to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC. An NRS policy will be considered to reduce or limit the rights of the insured with respect to the underlying policy or plan of insurance if RMA determines it affects, alters, preempts, or undermines the terms or conditions of the underlying policy or procedures issued by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(3) The NRS disrupts the marketplace. An NRS policy will be considered to disrupt the marketplace if RMA determines it encourages planting more acres of the insured commodity in excess of normal market demand, adversely affects the sales or administration of reinsured policies, undermines producers' confidence in the Federal crop insurance program, or harms public perception of the Federal crop insurance program.</P>
              <P>(4) The NRS is an impermissible rebate. An NRS may be considered to be an impermissible rebate if RMA determines that the premium rates charged are insufficient to cover the expected losses and a reasonable reserve or it offers other benefits that are generally provided at a cost.</P>
              <P>(5) The NRS policy is conditioned upon or provides incentive for the purchase of the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC with a specific agent or approved insurance provider.</P>
              <P>(d) RMA will respond not less than 75 days before the first sales closing date or provide notice why RMA is unable to respond within the time frame allotted.</P>
              <P>(e) NRS policies reviewed by RMA will need to be submitted once every five years unless a change is made to the NRS or the underlying policy. Once any changes are made to either policy, or the five year period has concluded, the NRS must be resubmitted for review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basis and applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The regulations contained in this part prescribe the rules and criteria for obtaining a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation.</P>
              <P>(1) FCIC will provide a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, as applicable, for statutory, regulatory, or other policy provisions or procedures that were in effect during the four most recent crop years from the crop year in which your request was submitted. For example, for a request received in the 2014 crop year, FCIC will consider requests for the 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 crop years.</P>
              <P>(2) If FCIC determines a request is outside the scope of crop years authorized in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you will be notified within 30 days of the date of receipt by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(3) If the statutory, regulatory or other policy provisions or procedures have changed for the time period you seek an interpretation you must submit a separate request for each policy provision or procedure by year. For example, if you seek an interpretation of section 6(b) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions for the 2012 through 2015 crop years but the policy provisions were revised starting with the 2014 crop year, you must submit two requests, one for the 2012 and 2013 crop years and another for the 2014 and 2015 crop years.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation:</P>
              <P>(1) If there is a dispute between participants that involves a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation:</P>
              <P>(i) The parties are required to seek an interpretation of the disputed provision from FCIC in accordance with this subpart (This may require that the parties seek a stay of the proceedings until an interpretation is provided, if such proceedings have been initiated); and</P>

              <P>(ii) The final agency determination or FCIC interpretation may take the form of a written interpretation or, at the sole discretion of FCIC, may take the form of testimony from an employee of RMA expressly authorized in <PRTPAGE P="81"/>writing to provide interpretations of policy or procedure on behalf of FCIC.</P>
              <P>(2) All written final agency determinations issued by FCIC are binding on all participants in the Federal crop insurance program for the crop years the policy provisions are in effect. All written FCIC interpretations and testimony from an employee of RMA are binding on the parties to the dispute, including the arbitrator, mediator, judge, or NAD.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure to request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation when required by this subpart or failure of NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge to adhere to the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation provided under this subpart will result in the nullification of any award or agreement in arbitration or mediation in accordance with the provisions in the “Mediation, Arbitration, Appeal, Reconsideration, and Administrative and Judicial Review” section or similar section in all crop insurance policies.</P>
              <P>(4) If either party believes an award or decision was rendered by NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge based on a disputed provision in which there was a failure to request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation or NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge's decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision, the party may request FCIC review the matter to determine if a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought in accordance with § 400.767.</P>
              <P>(i) Requests should be submitted through one of the methods contained in § 400.767(a)(1);</P>
              <P>(ii) If FCIC determines that a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought and it was not, or the decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision:</P>
              <P>(A) The award is automatically nullified; and</P>
              <P>(B) Either party may appeal FCIC's determination that a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought and it was not, or the decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.</P>
              <P>(5) All written final agency determinations that are published on RMA's website are considered matters of general applicability and are not appealable to NAD. Before obtaining judicial review of any final agency determination, you must obtain an Administrative Final Determination from the Director of NAD on the issue of whether the final agency determination is a matter of general applicability.</P>
              <P>(6) With respect to an administrative review of a FCIC interpretation:</P>
              <P>(i) If either party to the proceeding does not agree with the written FCIC interpretation, a request for administrative review may be filed in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart J. If you seek an administrative review from FCIC, such request must be submitted in accordance with § 400.767(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) FCIC will not accept requests for administrative review from NAD, a mediator, or arbitrator.</P>
              <P>(iii) The RMA Office of the Deputy Administrator for Product Management will make a determination on the request for administrative review not later than 30 days after receipt of the request.</P>
              <P>(iv) Regardless of whether you have sought administrative review, you may appeal a FCIC interpretation under this subsection to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.</P>

              <P>(1) Be submitted to the Deputy Administrator using the guidelines provided on RMA's website at <E T="03">www.rma.usda.gov</E> through one of the following methods:</P>

              <P>(i) In writing by certified mail or overnight delivery, to the Deputy Administrator, Risk Management Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, Beacon Facility, Stop 0801, Room 421, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, MO 64141-6205;<PRTPAGE P="82"/>

              </P>
              <P>(2) State whether you are seeking a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation;</P>
              <P>(3) Identify and quote the specific provision in the Act, regulations, procedure, or policy provision for which you are requesting a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation;</P>
              <P>(4) Contain no more than one request for an interpretation (You must make separate requests for each provision if more than one provision is at issue. For example, if there is a dispute with the interpretation of Paragraph 3 of the Loss Adjustment Manual, then one request for an interpretation is required. If there is a dispute with the interpretation of Paragraph 3 of the Loss Adjustment Manual and Paragraph 2 of the Macadamia Nut Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook, then two separate requests for an interpretation are required);</P>
              <P>(5) State the crop, crop year(s), and plan of insurance applicable to the request;</P>
              <P>(6) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for the request;</P>
              <P>(7) Contain your detailed interpretation of the specific provision of the Act, regulations, procedure, or policy provision for which the request for interpretation is being requested; and</P>
              <P>(8) Not contain any specific facts, alleged conduct, or hypothetical situations or the request will be returned to the requestor without consideration.</P>
              <P>(b) You must advise FCIC if the request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation will be used in a judicial review, mediation, or arbitration.</P>
              <P>(1) You must identify the type of proceeding (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mediation, arbitration, or litigation), if applicable, in which the interpretation will be used, and the date the proceeding is scheduled to begin, or the earliest possible date the proceeding would likely begin if a specific date has not been established;</P>
              <P>(2) The name, address, telephone number, and if applicable, fax number, or email address of a contact person for both parties to the dispute;</P>
              <P>(3) Unless the parties elect to use the expedited review process available under the AAA rules or the appeal is before NAD, requests must be submitted not later than 90 days before the date the mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding in which the interpretation will be used is scheduled to begin.</P>
              <P>(i) If the rules of the court, mediation, or arbitration require the interpretation prior to the date the proceeding begins, add 90 days to the number of days required prior to the proceeding. For example, if a court requires the interpretation 20 days prior to the date the proceeding begins, you must submit the request 110 days before the proceeding is scheduled to begin.</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure to timely submit a request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation may result in:</P>
              <P>(A) FCIC issuing a determination that no interpretation could be made because the request was not timely submitted; and</P>
              <P>(B) Nullification of any agreement or award in accordance with § 400.766 if no final agency determination or FCIC interpretation can be provided.</P>
              <P>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if during the mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding, an issue arises that requires a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation the mediator, arbitrator, judge, or magistrate must promptly request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation in accordance with § 400.767(a).</P>
              <P>(4) FCIC at its sole discretion may authorize personnel to provide an oral or written final agency determination or FCIC interpretation, as appropriate; and</P>
              <P>(5) Any decision or settlement resulting from such mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding before FCIC provides its final agency determination or FCIC interpretation can be nullified in accordance with § 400.766.</P>

              <P>(c) If multiple parties are involved and have opposing interpretations, a joint request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation including both requestor interpretations in one request is encouraged. If multiple insured persons are parties to the <PRTPAGE P="83"/>dispute, and the request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation applies to all parties, one request may be submitted for all insured persons instead of separate requests for each person. In this case, the information required in this section must be provided for each person.</P>

              <SUBJECT>FCIC obligations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FCIC will not provide a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation for any request regarding, or that contains, specific factual information to situations or cases, such as acts or failures to act of any participant under the terms of a policy, procedure, or any reinsurance agreement.</P>
              <P>(1) FCIC will not consider specific factual information to situations or cases in any final agency determination or FCIC interpretation.</P>
              <P>(2) FCIC will not consider any examples or hypotheticals provided in your interpretation because those are fact-specific and could be construed as a finding of fact by FCIC. If an example or hypothetical is required to illustrate an interpretation, FCIC will provide the example in the interpretation.</P>
              <P>(b) If, in the sole judgment of FCIC, the request is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete, FCIC will not provide a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation, but will notify you within 30 days of the date of receipt by FCIC that the request is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete.</P>
              <P>(c) If FCIC notifies you that a request is unclear, ambiguous or incomplete under paragraph (b) of this section, the 90-day time period for FCIC to provide a response is stopped on the date FCIC notifies you. On the date FCIC receives a clear, complete, and unambiguous request, FCIC has the balance of the days remaining in the 90-day time period to provide a response to you. For example, FCIC receives a request for a final agency determination on January 10. On February 10, FCIC notifies you the request is unclear. On March 10, FCIC receives a clarified request that meets all requirements for FCIC to provide a final agency determination. FCIC has sixty days from March 10, the balance of the 90-day time period, to provide a response.</P>
              <P>(d) FCIC reserves the right to modify the request if FCIC determines that a request for a final agency determination is really a request for a FCIC interpretation or vice versa.</P>
              <P>(e) FCIC will provide you a written final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation within 90 days of the date of receipt for a request that meets all requirements in § 400.767.</P>
              <P>(f) If FCIC does not provide a response within 90 days of receipt of a request, you may assume your interpretation is correct for the applicable crop year. However, your interpretation shall not be considered generally applicable and shall not be binding on any other program participants. Additionally, in the case of a joint request for a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, if FCIC does not provide a response within 90 days, neither party may assume their interpretations are correct.</P>
              <P>(g) FCIC will publish all final agency determinations as specially numbered documents on the RMA website because they are generally applicable to all program participants.</P>
              <P>(h) FCIC will not publish any FCIC interpretation because it is only applicable to the parties in the dispute. You are responsible for providing copies of the FCIC interpretation to all other parties.</P>
              <P>(i) When issuing a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, FCIC will not evaluate the insured, insurance provider, agent, or loss adjuster as it relates to their performance of following FCIC policy provisions or procedures. Interpretations will not include any analysis of whether the insured, insurance provider, agent, or loss adjuster was in compliance with the policy provision or procedure in question.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General statement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to implement a catastrophic risk protection plan of insurance that provides a basic level of insurance coverage to protect producers in the event of a catastrophic crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, provided the crop loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified in the crop insurance policy. This Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is a continuous endorsement that is effective in conjunction with a crop insurance policy for the insured crop. Catastrophic risk protection coverage will be offered through approved insurance providers if there are a sufficient number available to service the area. If there are an insufficient number available, as determined by the Secretary, local offices of the Farm Service Agency will provide catastrophic risk protection coverage.</P>

              <P>If a conflict exists among the policy, the order of priority is: (1) This Endorsement; (2) Special Provisions; (3) actuarial documents; (4) the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable; and (5) any of the policies specified in section 2, with (1) controlling (2), etc.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Eligibility, Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination</HD>
              <P>(a) You must have one of the following policies in force to elect this Endorsement:</P>
              <P>(1) The Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8) and applicable Crop Provisions (catastrophic risk protection coverage is not available under individual revenue plans of insurance such as Revenue Protection and Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion);</P>
              <P>(2) The Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions (catastrophic risk protection coverage is not available under area revenue plans of insurance such as Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion); or</P>
              <P>(3) Other crop policies only if catastrophic risk protection coverage is provided in the applicable crop policy.</P>
              <P>(b) You must have made application for catastrophic risk protection on or before the sales closing date for the crop in the county.</P>
              <P>(c) You must be a “person” as defined in the crop policy to be eligible for catastrophic risk protection coverage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Unit Division</HD>
              <P>(a) This section is not applicable if you are insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) This section is in lieu of the unit provisions specified in the applicable crop policy. For catastrophic risk protection coverage, a unit will be all insurable acreage of the insured crop in the county on the date coverage begins for the crop year:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have one hundred percent (100%) crop share; or</P>
              <P>(2) Which is owned by one person and operated by another person on a share basis.</P>

              <P>(Example: If, in addition to the land you own, you rent land from five landlords, three on a crop share basis and two on a cash basis, <PRTPAGE P="85"/>you would be entitled to four units; one for each crop share lease and one that combines the two cash leases and the land you own.)</P>
              <P>(c) Further division of the units described in section 3(b) is not allowed under this Endorsement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>(a) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, catastrophic risk protection coverage will offer protection equal to:</P>
              <P>(1) Fifty percent (50%) of your approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the price election or projected price, as applicable, if you are insured under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8) and applicable Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Sixty-five percent (65%) of the expected county yield indemnified at forty-five percent (45%) of the maximum protection per acre if you are insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(3) A comparable coverage as established by FCIC for other crop policies only if catastrophic risk protection coverage is provided in the applicable crop policy.</P>
              <P>(b) If the crop policy denominates coverage in dollars per acre or other measure, or any other alternative method of coverage, such coverage will be converted to the amount of coverage that would be payable at fifty percent (50%) of your approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the price election.</P>
              <P>(c) You may elect catastrophic coverage for any crop insured or reinsured by FCIC on either an individual yield and loss basis or an area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered as set out in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Report of Acreage</HD>
              <P>(a) The report of crop acreage that you file in accordance with the crop policy must be signed on or before the acreage reporting date. For catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf, the operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the operator purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained in that acreage report.</P>

              <P>(b) For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity only, your share will not exceed your insurable interest at the earlier of the time of loss or the beginning of harvest. Unless the accepted application clearly indicates that insurance is requested for a partnership or joint venture, insurance will only cover the crop share of the person completing the application. The share will not extend to any other person having an interest in the crop except as may otherwise be specifically allowed in this endorsement. Any acreage or interest reported by or for your spouse, child or any member of your household may be considered your share. A lease containing provisions for both a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.) <E T="03">and</E> a crop share will be considered a crop share lease. A lease containing provisions for either a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,) <E T="03">or</E> a crop share will be considered a cash lease. Land rented for cash, a fixed commodity payment, or any consideration other than a share in the insured crop on such land will be considered as owned by the lessee.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees</HD>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in sections 6(f) and (h) and notwithstanding any provision contained in any other policy document, you will not be responsible to pay a premium, nor will the policy be terminated because the premium has not been paid. FCIC will pay a premium subsidy equal to the premium established for the coverage provided under this endorsement.</P>
              <P>(b) In return for catastrophic risk protection coverage, you must pay an administrative fee and premium as specified in section 6(f) to us within 30 days after you have been billed, unless otherwise authorized in the Federal Crop Insurance Act (You will be billed by the date stated in the actuarial documents);</P>
              <P>(1) The administrative fee owed is $655 for each crop in the county unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop (if you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be subject to criminal and administrative sanctions).</P>
              <P>(c) The administrative fee provisions of section 6(b) do not apply if you are a “beginning farmer or “rancher,” “veteran farmer or rancher,” or “limited resource farmer” as defined in the applicable crop policy. The administrative fee will be waived if you request it and you meet the requirements contained in the annual premium provisions of the applicable crop policy.</P>
              <P>(d) When a crop policy has provisions to allow you the option to separately insure individual crop types or varieties, you must pay a separate administrative fee in accordance with section 6(b) for each type or variety you elect to separately insure.</P>

              <P>(e) If the administrative fee and premium as specified in section 6(f) is not paid when due, you, and all persons with an insurable interest in the crop under the same contract, <PRTPAGE P="86"/>may be ineligible for certain other USDA program benefits.</P>
              <P>(f) You will be responsible for payment of the premium established for the coverage provided under this endorsement if:</P>
              <P>(1) USDA determines you have committed a violation of the highly erodible land conservation or wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12 as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014; or</P>
              <P>(2) You have not filed form AD-1026 with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date.</P>
              <P>(i) Notwithstanding section 6(f)(2), you may be eligible for premium subsidy without having a timely filed form AD-1026:</P>
              <P>(A) For the initial reinsurance year if you certify by the premium billing date for your policy that you meet the qualifications as outlined in FCIC approved procedures for producers who are new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new entity, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026; or</P>
              <P>(B) If FSA approves relief for failure to timely file due to circumstances beyond your control or failure to timely provide adequate information to complete form AD-1026 in accordance with the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 12.</P>
              <P>(ii) To be eligible for premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC, it is your responsibility to assure you meet all the requirements for:</P>
              <P>(A) Compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 6(f)(1) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) Filing form AD-1026 to be properly identified as in compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 6(f)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) If the Act expressly authorizes an option or endorsement to be available in addition to the coverage available under this Endorsement (for example, the Supplemental Coverage Option) or any other additional coverage offered under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (for example, the Stacked Income Protection Plan), you will owe a separate annual premium and administrative fee for such option or endorsement if the option or endorsement has been made available in the actuarial documents and you elect to purchase such coverage.</P>
              <P>(h) Failure to pay the premium specified in section 6(f) will result in the termination of the policy and all other policies in accordance with the termination provisions specified in the applicable Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>The crop insured is specified in the applicable crop policy; however, for policies other than those insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions, notwithstanding any other policy provision requiring the same insurance coverage on all insurable acreage of the crop in the county, if you purchase additional coverage for a crop, you may separately insure acreage designated as “high-risk” land by FCIC under catastrophic risk protection coverage, provided that you execute a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option and obtain a catastrophic risk protection coverage policy with the same insurance provider on or before the applicable sales closing date. You will be required to pay a separate administrative fee for both the additional coverage policy and the catastrophic risk protection coverage policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Replanting Payment</HD>
              <P>Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance document, no replant payment will be paid whether or not replanting of the crop is required under the policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Claim for Indemnity</HD>
              <P>If two or more insured crop types, varieties, or classes are insured within the same unit, and multiple price elections, projected prices, or amounts of insurance are applicable, the dollar amount of insurance and the dollar amount of production to be counted will be determined separately for each type, variety, class, etc., that have separate price elections, projected prices, or amounts of insurance and then totaled to determine the total liability or dollar amount of production to be counted for the unit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Concealment or Fraud</HD>
              <P>Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance document, your CAT policy may be voided by us on all crops without waiving any of our rights, including the right to collect any amounts due:</P>
              <P>(a) If at any time you conceal or misrepresent any material fact or commit fraud relating to this or any other contract issued under the authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Act with any insurance provider; and</P>
              <P>(b) The voidance will be effective for the crop year during which any such act or omission occurred.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Exclusion of Coverage</HD>
              <P>(a) Options or endorsements that extend the coverage available under any crop policy offered by FCIC will not be available under this endorsement, except for the Supplemental Coverage Option and any other option or endorsement or other additional coverage expressly authorized in the Federal Crop Insurance Act and allowed in the actuarial documents (for example, the Stacked Income Protection Plan). Written agreements are not available for any crop insured under this endorsement.</P>

              <P>(b) Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop policy, hail and fire <PRTPAGE P="87"/>coverage and high-risk land may not be excluded under catastrophic risk protection.</P>

            <P>(a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this part on the insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) (Act). The crops and counties shall be designated by the Manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) from those approved by the Board of Directors of FCIC.</P>
            <P>(b) The insurance is offered through insurance providers reinsured by the FCIC that offer contracts containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may offer the contract for coverage contained in this part and part 402 of this chapter directly to the insured through the Department of Agriculture if the Secretary determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.</P>
            <P>(c) No person may have in force more than one insurance policy issued or reinsured by FCIC on the same crop for the same crop year, in the same county, unless specifically approved in writing by FCIC.</P>
            <P>(d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a person has more than one contract authorized under the Act that provides coverage for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the person will be liable for the premium on all contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the FCIC that the multiple contracts of insurance were without the fault of the person.</P>

              <P>(g) If you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, not eligible to obtain an SSN or EIN, whichever is required, you must request an assigned number for the purposes of this policy from us:</P>
              <P>(1) A number will be provided only if you can demonstrate you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, eligible to receive Federal benefits;</P>
              <P>(2) If a number cannot be provided for you in accordance with section (2)(g)(1), your application will not be accepted; or</P>
              <P>(3) If a number cannot be provided for any person with a substantial beneficial interest in you in accordance with section 2(g)(1), the amount of coverage for all crops on the application will be reduced proportionately by the percentage interest of such person in you.</P>
              <P>(h) After acceptance of the application, you may not cancel this policy for the initial crop year unless you choose to insure the entire crop under another Federally reinsured plan of insurance with the same insurance provider on or before the sales closing date. After the first year, the policy will continue in force for each succeeding crop year unless canceled, voided or terminated as provided in this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Either you or we may cancel this policy after the initial crop year by providing written notice to the other on or before the cancellation date shown in the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(j) Any amount owed to us for any policy authorized under the Act will be offset from any indemnity due you for this or any other crop insured with us under the authority of the Act.</P>
              <P>(1) Even if your claim has not yet been paid, you must still pay the premium and administrative fee on or before the termination date for you to remain eligible for insurance.</P>
              <P>(2) If we offset any amount due us from an indemnity owed to you, the date of payment for the purpose of determining whether you have a delinquent debt will be the date FCIC publishes the final county yield for the applicable crop year.</P>
              <P>(k) A delinquent debt for any policy will make you ineligible to obtain crop insurance authorized under the Act for any subsequent crop year and result in termination of all policies in accordance with section 2(k)(2).</P>
              <P>(1) With respect to ineligibility:</P>
              <P>(i) Ineligibility for crop insurance will be effective on:</P>
              <P>(A) The date that a policy was terminated in accordance with section 2(k)(2) for the crop for which you failed to pay premium, an administrative fee, or any related interest owed, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(B) The payment due date contained in any notification of indebtedness for overpaid indemnity and any other amounts due, including but not limited to, premium billed with a due date after the termination date for the crop year in which premium is earned, if you fail to pay the amount owed, including any related interest owed, as applicable, by such due date; or</P>
              <P>(C) The termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which a scheduled payment is due under a written payment agreement if you fail to pay the amount owed by any payment date in any agreement to pay the debt.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you are ineligible and a policy has been terminated in accordance with section 2(k)(2), you will not receive any indemnity, and such ineligibility and termination of the policy may affect your eligibility for benefits under other USDA programs. Any indemnity that may be owed for the policy before it has been terminated will remain owed to you, but may be offset in accordance with section 2(j), unless your policy was terminated in accordance with sections (k)(2)(i)(A), (B) or (D).</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to termination:</P>
              <P>(i) Termination will be effective on:</P>
              <P>(A) For a policy with unpaid administrative fees or premiums, the termination date immediately subsequent to the premium billing date for the crop year (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity will be owed);</P>

              <P>(B) For a policy with other amounts due, including but not limited to, premium billed <PRTPAGE P="97"/>with a due date after the termination date for the crop year in which premium is earned, the termination date immediately following the date you have a delinquent debt (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity will be owed);</P>
              <P>(C) For all other policies that are issued by us under the authority of the Act, the termination date that coincides with the termination date for the policy with the delinquent debt, or if there is no coincidental termination date, the termination date immediately following the date you become ineligible; or</P>
              <P>(D) For execution of a written payment agreement and failure to make any scheduled payment, the termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which you failed to make the scheduled payment (for this purpose only, the crop year will start the day after the termination date and end on the next termination date, e.g., if the termination date is November 30 and you fail to make a payment on November 15, 2019, your policy will terminate on November 30, 2018, for the 2019 crop year).</P>
              <P>(ii) For all policies terminated under section 2(k)(2)(i)(A), (B) or (D), any indemnities paid subsequent to the termination date must be repaid.</P>
              <P>(iii) Once the policy is terminated, it cannot be reinstated for the current crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(A) The termination was in error;</P>
              <P>(B) The Administrator of the Risk Management Agency, at his or her sole discretion, determines that the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) In accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC issued procedures, you provide documentation that your failure to pay your debt is due to an unforeseen or unavoidable event or an extraordinary weather event that created an impossible situation for you to make timely payment;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us or FCIC with your request submitted in accordance with section 2(k)(2)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us no later than 60 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation; or</P>
              <P>(C) We determine that, in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC issued procedures, the following are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You can demonstrate:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) You made timely payment for the amount of premium owed but you inadvertently omitted some small amount, such as the most recent month's interest or a small administrative fee;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The amount of the payment was clearly transposed from the amount that was otherwise due (For example, you owed $892 but you paid $829); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) You timely made the full payment of the amount owed but the delivery of that payment was delayed, and was postmarked no more than seven calendar days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice to you of an amount due, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and applicable procedures no later than 30 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation.</P>
              <P>(iv) A determination made under:</P>
              <P>(A) Section 2(k)(2)(iii)(B) may only be appealed to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11; and</P>
              <P>(B) Section 2(k)(2)(iii)(C) may only be appealed in accordance with section 23.</P>
              <P>(3) To regain eligibility, you must:</P>
              <P>(i) Repay the delinquent debt in full;</P>

              <P>(ii) Execute a written payment agreement in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart <PRTPAGE P="98"/>U, and make payments in accordance with the agreement; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.</P>
              <P>(4) If you are determined to be ineligible under section 2(k), persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you may also be ineligible until you become eligible again.</P>
              <P>(l) In cases where there has been a death, disappearance, judicially declared incompetence, or dissolution of any insured person:</P>
              <P>(1) If any married insured dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, the insured on the policy will automatically convert to the name of the spouse if:</P>
              <P>(i) The spouse was included on the policy as having a substantial beneficial interest in the insured; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The spouse has a share of the crop.</P>
              <P>(2) The provisions in section 2(l)(3) will only be applicable if:</P>
              <P>(i) Any partner, member, shareholder, etc., of an insured entity dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, and such event automatically dissolves the entity; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An individual whose estate is left to a beneficiary other than a spouse or left to the spouse and the criteria in section 2(l)(1) are not met, dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent.</P>
              <P>(3) If the death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence occurred:</P>
              <P>(i) More than 30 days before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Thirty days or less before the cancellation date, or on after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted on or before the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and</P>
              <P>(B) Any indemnity will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment provided such person or persons comply with all policy provisions and timely pays the premium.</P>
              <P>(4) If any insured entity is dissolved for reasons other than death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence:</P>
              <P>(i) Before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or</P>
              <P>(ii) On or after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted on or before the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and</P>
              <P>(B) Any indemnity will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment provided such person or persons comply with all policy provisions and timely pays the premium.</P>
              <P>(5) If section 2(k)(2) or (4) applies, a remaining member of the insured person or the beneficiary is required to report to us the death, disappearance, judicial incompetence, or other event that causes dissolution of the entity not later than the next cancellation date, except if section 2(k)(3)(ii) applies, notice must be provided by the cancellation date for the next crop year.</P>
              <P>(m) We may cancel your policy if no premium is earned for 3 consecutive years.</P>
              <P>(n) The cancellation and termination dates are contained in the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(o) Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or such other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign. You are still responsible for the accuracy of all information provided on your behalf and may be subject to the consequences in section 8(g), and any other consequences, including administrative, criminal or civil sanctions, if any information has been misreported.</P>
              <P>(p) If voidance, cancellation or termination of insurance coverage occurs for any reason, including but not limited to indebtedness, suspension, debarment, disqualification, cancellation by you or us or your policy is voided due to a conviction of the controlled substance provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 or Title 21, a new application must be filed for the crop.</P>
              <P>(1) Insurance coverage will not be provided if you are ineligible under the contract or under any Federal statute or regulation.</P>

              <P>(2) Since applications for crop insurance cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment, or you otherwise become eligible, after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the next crop year. For example, for the 2018 crop year, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 2018, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 2019, are insured and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination date, you are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 2018, and crop A's policy is terminated as of that date. Crop B's policy does not terminate until March 15, 2019, and an indemnity for the 2018 crop year may still be owed. You <PRTPAGE P="99"/>will not be eligible to apply for crop insurance for any crop until after the amounts owed are paid in full or you have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>(a) We may change the terms and conditions of this policy from year to year.</P>
              <P>(b) Any changes in policy provisions, the CEPP, amounts of insurance, expected county yields, premium rates, and program dates can be viewed on RMA's website not later than the contract change date contained in the Crop Provisions. We may only revise this information after the contract change date to correct obvious errors (e.g., the expected county revenue for a county was announced at $2,500 per acre instead of $250 per acre).</P>
              <P>(c) After the contract change date, all changes specified in section 3(b) will also be available upon request from your crop insurance agent.</P>
              <P>(d) Not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop you will be provided, in accordance with section 20, a copy of the changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, CEPP, if applicable, and Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) Acceptance of all the changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) The insured crop will be that shown on your accepted application and as specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, and must be grown on insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(b) A crop which will NOT be insured will include, but will not be limited to, any crop:</P>
              <P>(1) That is not grown on planted acreage;</P>
              <P>(2) That is a type not generally recognized for the area;</P>
              <P>(3) For which the information necessary for insurance (projected price, expected county yield, premium rate, etc.) is not included in the actuarial documents;</P>
              <P>(4) That is a volunteer crop;</P>
              <P>(5) Planted following the same crop on the same acreage and the first planting of the crop has been harvested in the same crop year unless specifically permitted by the Crop Provisions or the Special Provisions (For example, the second planting of grain sorghum would not be insurable if grain sorghum had already been planted and harvested on the same acreage during the crop year);</P>
              <P>(6) That is planted for experimental purposes; or</P>
              <P>(7) That is used solely for wildlife protection or management. If the lease states that specific acreage must remain unharvested, only that acreage is uninsurable. If the lease specifies that a percentage of the crop must be left unharvested, your share will be reduced by such percentage.</P>
              <P>(c) Although certain policy documents may state that a specific crop, type, or practice is not insurable, it does not mean all other crops, types, or practices are insurable. To be insurable, the use of such crop, type, or practice must be a good faming practice, have been widely used in the county, and meet all the conditions in the Basic Provisions, the Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, and the actuarial documents.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in section 5(c), the insurable acreage is all of the acreage of the insured crop for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents, in which you have a share, and which is planted in the county listed on your accepted application. The dollar amount of insurance per acre, amount of premium, and indemnity will be calculated separately for each crop, type, and practice shown on the actuarial documents.</P>
              <P>(1) The acreage must have been planted and harvested (grazing is not considered harvested for the purposes of this section) or insured (excluding pasture, rangeland, and forage, vegetation and rainfall insurance or any other specific policy listed in the Special Provisions) in at least one of the three previous crop years unless:</P>
              <P>(i) Such acreage was not planted:</P>
              <P>(A) In at least two of the three previous crop years to comply with any other USDA program;</P>
              <P>(B) Due to the crop rotation, the acreage would not have been planted in the previous three years (e.g., a crop rotation of corn, soybeans, and alfalfa; and the alfalfa remained for four years before the acreage was planted to corn again); or</P>
              <P>(C) Because a perennial crop was on the acreage in at least two of the previous three crop years;</P>
              <P>(ii) Such acreage constitutes five percent or less of the insured planted acreage of the crop, type and practice as shown on the actuarial documents in the county;</P>
              <P>(iii) Such acreage was not planted or harvested because it was pasture or rangeland and the crop to be insured is also pasture or rangeland; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The Crop Provisions or Special Provisions specifically allow insurance for such acreage.</P>
              <P>(b) Only the acreage planted to the insured crop on or before the final planting date, as shown in the actuarial documents, and reported by the acreage reporting date and physically located in the county shown on your accepted application will be insured.</P>

              <P>(c) We will not insure any acreage (and any uninsured acreage and production from uninsured acreage will not be included for the <PRTPAGE P="100"/>purposes of establishing the final county yield):</P>
              <P>(1) Where the crop was destroyed or put to another use during the crop year for the purpose of conforming with, or obtaining a payment under, any other program administered by the USDA;</P>
              <P>(2) Where we determine you have failed to follow good farming practices for the insured crop;</P>
              <P>(3) Where the conditions under which the crop is planted are not generally recognized for the area (for example, where agricultural experts determine that planting a non-irrigated corn crop after a failed small grain crop on the same acreage in the same crop year is not appropriate for the area);</P>
              <P>(4) Of a second crop, if you elect not to insure such acreage when an indemnity for a first insured crop may be subject to reduction in accordance with the provisions of section 13 and you intend to collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop acreage. This election must be made for all first insured crop acreage that may be subject to an indemnity reduction if the first insured crop is insured under this policy, or on a first insured crop unit basis if the first insured crop is not insured under this policy (e.g., if the first insured crop under this policy consists of 40 acres, or the first insured crop unit insured under another policy contains 40 planted acres, then no second crop can be insured on any of the 40 acres). In this case:</P>
              <P>(i) If the first insured crop is insured under ARPI, you must provide written notice to us of your election not to insure acreage of a second crop by the acreage reporting date for the second crop if it is insured under ARPI, or before planting the second crop if it is insured under any other policy;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the first insured crop is not insured under ARPI, at the time the first insured crop acreage is released by us or another insurance provider who insures the first insured crop (if no acreage in the first insured crop unit is released, this election must be made by the earlier of acreage reporting date for the second crop or when you sign the claim for the first insured crop);</P>
              <P>(iii) If you fail to provide a notice as specified in section 5(c)(5)(i) or 5(c)(5)(ii), the second crop acreage will be insured in accordance with applicable policy provisions and you must repay any overpaid indemnity for the first insured crop;</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event a second crop is planted and insured with a different insurance provider, or planted and insured by a different person, you must provide written notice to each insurance provider that a second crop was planted on acreage on which you had a first insured crop; and</P>
              <P>(v) You must report the crop acreage that will not be insured on the applicable acreage report; and</P>
              <P>(5) Of a crop planted following a second crop or following an insured crop that is prevented from being planted after a first insured crop, unless it is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts for the area to plant three or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year, and additional coverage insurance provided under the authority of the Act is offered for the third or subsequent crop in the same crop year. Insurance will only be provided for a third or subsequent crop as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) You must provide records acceptable to us that show:</P>
              <P>(A) You have produced and harvested the insured crop following two other crops harvested on the same acreage in the same crop year in at least two of the last four years in which you produced the insured crop; or</P>
              <P>(B) The applicable acreage has had three or more crops produced and harvested on it in the same crop year in at least two of the last four years in which the insured crop was grown on the acreage; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of insurable acreage will not exceed 100 percent of the greatest number of acres for which you provide the records required in section 5(c)(5)(i).</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in section 5(e), and in accordance with section 5(f), in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, or South Dakota, native sod acreage may be insured if the requirements of section 5(a) have been met but will:</P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding the provisions in section 6, receive a liability that is based on 65 percent of the protection factor; and</P>
              <P>(2) For additional coverage policies, receive a premium subsidy that is 50 percentage points less than would otherwise be provided on acreage not qualifying as native sod. If the premium subsidy applicable to these acres is less than 50 percent before the reduction, you will receive no premium subsidy.</P>
              <P>(e) Section 5(d) is not applicable to cumulative native sod acreage that is five acres or less in the county.</P>
              <P>(f) Section 5(d) is applicable during the first 4 crop years of planting on native sod acreage that has been tilled beginning on February 8, 2014, and ending on December 20, 2018. Section 5(d) is applicable during 4 cumulative crop years of insurance within the first 10 crop years after initial tillage on native sod acreage tilled after December 20, 2018.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Coverage, Coverage Levels, Protection Factor, and Policy Protection</HD>

              <P>(a) For all acreage of the insured crop in the county, you must select the same plan of insurance (e.g., all Area Revenue Protection, <PRTPAGE P="101"/>all Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion, or all Area Yield Protection), if such plans are available on the actuarial documents.</P>
              <P>(b) You must choose a protection factor:</P>

              <P>(2) For Area Yield Protection:</P>
              <P>(i) CAT level of coverage is available, and you may select the CAT level of coverage for any crop, type, and practice;</P>

              <P>(iii) You may have CAT level of coverage on one type and practice shown on the actuarial documents for the crop, and additional coverage on another type and practice for the same crop. You may also have different additional levels of coverage by type and practice.</P>
              <P>(d) You may change the plan of insurance, protection factor, or coverage level, for the following crop year by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop.</P>

              <P>(f) Policy protection for ARPI plans of insurance is calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiply the dollar amount of insurance per acre for each crop, type, and practice by the number of acres insured for such crop, type and practice; and</P>
              <P>(2) Multiply the result of paragraph (1) by your share.</P>

              <P>(1) Area Revenue Protection and Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion will not be provided and you will automatically be covered under the Area Yield Protection plan of insurance for the current crop year unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date;</P>
              <P>(2) Notice of availability of the projected price will be provided on RMA's website by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the CEPP;</P>

              <P>(iii) You were insured prior to the 2005 crop year or for the 2005 crop year and your administrative fee was waived for one or more of those crop years because you qualified as <PRTPAGE P="102"/>a limited resource farmer under a policy definition previously in effect, and you remain qualified as a limited resource farmer under the definition that was in effect at the time the administrative fee was waived;</P>
              <P>(7) Will not be required if you file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop. If you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions; and</P>

              <P>(e) The amount of premium calculated in accordance with section 7(d)(3) is earned and payable at the time coverage begins. You will be billed for such premium and applicable administrative fees not earlier than the premium billing date specified in the actuarial documents.</P>
              <P>(f) If the amount of premium calculated in accordance with section 7(d)(3) and administrative fees you are required to pay for any acreage exceeds the amount of policy protection for the acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (No premium or administrative fee will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).</P>
              <P>(g) Premium or administrative fees owed by you will be offset from an indemnity due you in accordance with section 2(j).</P>
              <P>(h) If you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, your premium subsidy will be 10 percentage points greater than the premium subsidy that you would otherwise receive, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>

If the correction of any misreported information would affect an indemnity that was paid in a prior crop year, such claim will be adjusted and you will be required to repay any overpaid amounts.</P>
              <P>(j) You may request an acreage measurement from FSA or a business that provides such measurement service prior to the acreage reporting date, submit documentation of such request and an acreage report with estimated acreage by the acreage reporting date, and if the acreage measurement shows the estimated acreage was incorrect, we will revise your acreage report to reflect the correct acreage:</P>

              <P>(2) If you fail to provide any records we require to determine whether an insurable loss occurred for the second crop.</P>
              <P>(c) You may receive a full indemnity for a first insured crop when a second crop is planted on the same acreage in the same crop year, regardless of whether or not the second crop is insured or sustains an insurable loss, if each of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) It is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts for the area to plant two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year;</P>

              <P>(d) The receipt of a full indemnity on both crops that are double cropped is limited to the number of acres for which you can demonstrate you have double cropped or that have been historically double cropped as specified in section 13(c).</P>
              <P>(1) If the records you provided are from acreage you double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may apply your history of double cropping to any acreage of the insured crop in the county (e.g., if you have double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire an additional 100 acres in the county, you can apply that history of double cropped acreage to any of the 200 acres in the county as long as it does not exceed 100 acres); or</P>
              <P>(2) If the records you provided are from acreage that another producer double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may only use the history of double cropping for the same physical acres from which double cropping records were provided (e.g., if a neighbor has double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire your neighbor's 100 double cropped acres and an additional 100 acres in the county, you can only apply your neighbor's history of double cropped acreage to the same 100 acres that your neighbor double cropped).</P>

              <P>(2) To the extent that practices used during the crop year change from those upon which the expected county yield is based, the final county yield may be adjusted to reflect the yield that would have resulted but for the change in practice. For example, if the county is traditionally 90 percent irrigated and 10 percent non-irrigated, but this year the county is now 50 percent irrigated and 50 percent non-irrigated, the final county yield will be adjusted to an amount as if the county had 90 percent irrigated acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) If the final county yield is established from a data source other than that used to establish the expected county yield, FCIC will provide notice of the data source and the reason for the change at the time the final county yield is published.</P>
              <P>(e) If yields are based on NASS data, the final county yield will be the most current NASS yield at the time FCIC determines the yield in accordance with the payment dates section of the applicable Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(f) The final county yield determined by FCIC is considered final for the purposes of establishing whether an indemnity is due and will not be revised for any reason.</P>

              <P>(d) With respect to any other determination under this policy:</P>
              <P>(1) If you and we fail to agree on any determination not covered by sections 23(a) and (c), the disagreement may be resolved through mediation. To resolve any dispute through mediation, you and we must both:</P>

              <P>(i) Any interpretation by FCIC will be binding in any mediation or arbitration.</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure to obtain any required interpretation from FCIC will result in the nullification of any agreement or award.</P>
              <P>(iii) An interpretation by FCIC of a policy provision is considered a determination that is a matter of general applicability. However, before such interpretation may be challenged in the courts, you must request a determination of non-appealability from the Director of the National Appeals Division not later than 30 days after the date the interpretation was published on RMA's website.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless the dispute is resolved through mediation, the arbitrator must provide to you and us a written statement describing the issues in dispute, the factual findings, the determinations and the amount and basis for any award and breakdown by claim for any award.</P>
              <P>(i) The statement must also include any amounts awarded for interest.</P>

              <P>(i) The initiation of arbitration proceedings must occur within one year of the date we denied your claim or rendered the determination with which you disagree, whichever is later;</P>
              <P>(ii) If you fail to initiate arbitration in accordance with section 23(d)(5)(i) and complete the process, you will not be able to resolve the dispute through judicial review;</P>
              <P>(iii) If arbitration has been initiated in accordance with section 23(d)(5)(i) and completed, and judicial review is sought, suit must be filed not later than one year after the date the arbitration decision was rendered; and</P>

Such interpretation will be binding on all parties.</P>
              <P>(6) Any decision rendered in arbitration is binding on you and us unless judicial review is sought in accordance with section 23(d)(5)(iii). Notwithstanding any provision in the rules of the AAA, you and we have the right to judicial review of any decision rendered in arbitration.</P>
              <P>(e) In any mediation, arbitration, appeal, administrative review, reconsideration or judicial process, the terms of this policy, the Act, and the regulations published at 7 CFR chapter IV, including the provisions of 7 CFR part 400, subpart P, are binding. Conflicts between this policy and any state or local laws will be resolved in accordance with section 27.

              <P>The following are examples of the calculation of the premium, amount of insurance and indemnity for each of the three plans of insurance under ARPI. Your information will likely be different and you should consult the actuarial documents in your county and the policy information. The following facts are for illustration purposes only and apply to each of the examples.</P>
              <P>Producer A farms 100 acres in county X and has a 100 percent share, or 1.000, in those acres. From the actuarial documents in county X, Producer A elects the 75 percent coverage level and a protection factor of 110 percent or 1.10. The actuarial documents in county X also show that the expected county yield is 141.4 bushels per acre, the projected price is $4.00, and the expected county revenue is $565.60. The subsidy factor for the 75 percent coverage level is .55 for revenue coverage and .59 for yield coverage. The loss limit factor is 18 percent or .18. At the end of the insurance period, for county X, FCIC releases a harvest price of $4.57 and a final county yield for county X of 75.0 bushels.</P>
              <P>The premium rate is based on the published volatility factor and for this example is .0166 for Area Revenue Protection, .0146 for Area Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion, and .0116 for Area Yield Protection.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Index.</SUBJECT>
            <P>5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) requires that each agency publish, or otherwise make available, a current index of all materials available for public inspection and copying. RMA and FCIC will maintain a current index providing identifying information for the public as to any material issued, adopted, or promulgated by the Agency since July 4, 1967, and required by section 552(a)(2). Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act provisions, RMA and FCIC have determined that in view of the small number of public requests for such index, publication of such an index would be unnecessary and impracticable. Copies of the index will be available upon request in person or by mail at the address stated in § 412.2(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Availability of Federal crop insurance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this section on the insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (the Act). The crops and counties shall be designated by the Manager of the Corporation from those approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.</P>
            <P>(b) The insurance is offered through companies reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) that offer contracts containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may offer the contract for the catastrophic level of coverage contained in this part and part 402 directly to the insured through local offices of the Department of Agriculture only if the Secretary determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as specified in the Crop Provisions, the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement (part 402 of this chapter) and part 400, subpart T of this chapter, no person may have in force more than one contract on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county.</P>

            <P>(d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a person has more than one contract authorized under the Act that provides coverage for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the person will be liable <PRTPAGE P="124"/>for the premium on all contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the Corporation that the multiple contracts of insurance were without the fault of the person.</P>
            <P>(1) If the multiple contracts of insurance are shown to be without the fault of the person and:</P>
            <P>(i) One contract is an additional coverage policy and the other contract is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy, the additional coverage policy will apply if both policies are with the same insurance provider, or if not, both insurance providers agree, and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be canceled (If the insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in force and the other contract will be canceled); or</P>
            <P>(ii) Both contracts are additional coverage policies or both are Catastrophic Risk Protection policies, the contract with the earliest signature date on the application will be valid and the other contract on that crop in the county for that crop year will be canceled, unless both policies are with the same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees otherwise or both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree otherwise.</P>
            <P>(2) No liability for any indemnity, prevented planting payment, replanting payment or premium will attach to the contracts canceled as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) The person must repay all amounts received in violation of this section with interest at the rate contained in the contract (see § 457.8, paragraph 24).</P>
            <P>(f) An insured whose contract with the Corporation or with a company reinsured by the Corporation under the Act has been terminated because of violation of the terms of the contract is not eligible to obtain multiple peril crop insurance under the Act with the Corporation or with a company reinsured by the Corporation unless the insured can show that the default in the prior contract was cured prior to the sales closing date of the contract applied for or unless the insured can show that the termination was improper and should not result in subsequent ineligibility.</P>
            <P>(g) All applicants for insurance under the Act must advise the agent, in writing, at the time of application, of any previous applications for insurance or policies of insurance under the Act and the present status of any such applications or insurance.</P>

Changes made in the contract shall not affect its continuity from year to year. No indemnity shall be paid unless the insured complies with all terms and conditions of the contract, except as provided in the policy. The forms referred to in the contract are available at the offices of the crop insurance agent.</P>

No other person's interest in the crop may be insured under an application unless that person's interest is clearly shown on the application and unless that other person's interest is insured in accordance with the procedures of the Corporation. The application must be submitted to the Corporation or the reinsured company through the crop insurance agent and must be submitted on or before the applicable sales closing date on file.</P>

            <P>(c) If the producer had a Crop Revenue Coverage, Revenue Assurance, Income Protection, or Indexed Income Protection crop insurance policy in effect for the 2010 crop year and has not canceled or changed such coverage in accordance with such policy, revenue protection will continue in effect under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions and no new application is required. Revenue protection will be at the same coverage level, 100 percent of price, with any applicable options, endorsements, and enterprise or whole-farm unit structures that were in effect the previous year still in effect, as long as all qualifications are met and such coverage remains available.</P>
            <P>(1) If the producer had revenue coverage under the Revenue Assurance crop insurance policy for the 2010 crop year and:</P>
            <P>(i) The producer had the fall harvest price option, for the 2011 crop year the producer will have revenue protection under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions based on the greater of the projected price or the harvest price; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The producer did not have the fall harvest price option, for the 2011 crop year the producer will have revenue protection under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions and the harvest price exclusion.</P>
            <P>(2) If the producer had revenue coverage under the Income Protection or Indexed Income Protection crop insurance policy for the 2010 crop year, for the 2011 crop year the producer will have revenue protection under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions and the harvest price exclusion.</P>
            <P>(3) If the producer has revenue protection under paragraph (c) of this section, the producer may exclude coverage for hail and fire if the requirements are met.</P>
            <P>(d) If the producer had coverage under an Actual Production History crop insurance policy for a crop under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions for the 2010 crop year, and that crop now has revenue protection available, the producer will have yield protection for the crop under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions in effect for the 2011 crop year at the same coverage level, and percentage of price, any applicable options or endorsements, and enterprise unit structures that were in effect the previous year continue in effect, as long as all qualifications are met and such coverage remains available.</P>

            <P>(e) If the producer had coverage under Actual Production History or another crop insurance policy for a crop under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions for the 2010 crop year and that crop does not have revenue protection available for the 2011 crop year, the producer will continue with the same crop insurance policy <PRTPAGE P="126"/>(<E T="03">e.g.</E>, Actual Production History or amount of insurance) until canceled or terminated.</P>
            <P>(f) With respect to any crop insurance policy specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:</P>

            <P>(1) The producer may change their coverage (coverage level, percent of price, <E T="03">etc.</E>) in accordance with section 3 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions or the producer may cancel such coverage in accordance with section 2 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions. If the producer changes their crop insurance policy (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, Actual Production History, yield protection, revenue protection, amount of insurance, <E T="03">etc.</E>) for any crop year, the producer must elect the coverage level, percentage of price, any applicable options, endorsements, and unit structure (enterprise or whole-farm) that will be in effect under the new crop insurance policy.</P>
            <P>(2) If a producer has a properly executed Power of Attorney on file with the insurance provider, such Power of Attorney will remain in effect under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions until it is terminated.</P>
            <P>(3) If the producer has a current written agreement in effect for the crop for multiple crop years, such written agreement will remain in effect if the terms of the written agreement are still applicable, the conditions under which the written agreement was provided have not changed, and the crop insurance policy remains with the same insurance provider.</P>

              <P>(A) Such number is not corrected or provided by you, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(B) You cannot prove that any error or omission was inadvertent (Simply stating the error or omission was inadvertent is not sufficient to prove the error or omission was inadvertent); or</P>
              <P>(C) Even after the correct SSN or EIN is provided by you, it is determined that the incorrect or omitted SSN or EIN would have allowed you to obtain disproportionate benefits under the crop insurance program, the person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is determined to be ineligible for insurance, or you or the person with a substantial beneficial interest in you could avoid an obligation or requirement under any State or Federal law; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as provided in sections 2(b)(6)(ii)(B) and (C), your policies will not be voided if you subsequently provide the correct SSN or EIN for persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you and the persons are eligible for insurance;</P>
              <P>(7) When any of your policies are void under sections 2(b)(5) or (6):</P>
              <P>(i) You must repay any indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that may have been paid for all applicable crops and crop years;</P>
              <P>(ii) Even though the policies are void, you will still be required to pay an amount equal to 20 percent of the premium that you would otherwise be required to pay; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If you previously paid premium or administrative fees, any amount in excess of the amount required in section 2(b)(7)(ii) will be returned to you;</P>
              <P>(8) Notwithstanding any of the provisions in this section, if you certify to an incorrect SSN or EIN, or receive an indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment and the SSN or EIN was not correct, you may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions;</P>
              <P>(9) If any of the information regarding persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you changes after the sales closing date for the previous crop year, you must revise your application by the sales closing date for the current crop year to reflect the correct information. However, if such information changed less than 30 days before the sales closing date for the current crop year, you must revise your application by the sales closing date for the next crop year. If you fail to provide the required revisions, the provisions in section 2(b)(6) will apply; and</P>
              <P>(10) If you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, not eligible to obtain a SSN or EIN, whichever is required, you must request an assigned number for the purposes of this policy from us:</P>
              <P>(i) A number will be provided only if you can demonstrate you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, eligible to receive Federal benefits;</P>
              <P>(ii) If a number cannot be provided for you in accordance with section 2(b)(10)(i), your application will not be accepted; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If a number cannot be provided for any person with a substantial beneficial interest in you in accordance with section 2(b)(10)(i), the amount of coverage for all crops on the application will be reduced proportionately by the percentage interest of such person in you.</P>
              <P>(c) After acceptance of the application, you may not cancel this policy for the initial crop year. Thereafter, the policy will continue in force for each succeeding crop year unless canceled or terminated as provided below.</P>
              <P>(d) Either you or we may cancel this policy after the initial crop year by providing written notice to the other on or before the cancellation date shown in the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) Any amount owed to us for any policy authorized under the Act will be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment due you for this or any other crop insured with us under the authority of the Act.</P>
              <P>(1) Even if your claim has not yet been paid, you must still pay the premium and administrative fee on or before the termination date for you to remain eligible for insurance.</P>
              <P>(2) If we offset any amount due us from an indemnity or prevented planting payment owed to you, the date of payment for the purpose of determining whether you have a delinquent debt will be the date that you submit the claim for indemnity in accordance with section 14(e) (Your Duties).</P>
              <P>(f) A delinquent debt for any policy will make you ineligible to obtain crop insurance authorized under the Act for any subsequent crop year and result in termination of all policies in accordance with section 2(f)(2).</P>
              <P>(1) With respect to ineligibility:</P>
              <P>(i) Ineligibility for crop insurance will be effective on:</P>
              <P>(A) The date that a policy was terminated in accordance with section 2(f)(2) for the crop for which you failed to pay premium, an administrative fee, or any related interest owed, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(B) The payment due date contained in any notification of indebtedness for any overpaid indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment, if you fail to pay the amount owed, including any related interest owed, as applicable, by such due date; or</P>
              <P>(C) The termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which a scheduled payment is due under a written payment agreement if you fail to pay the amount owed by any payment date in any agreement to pay the debt.</P>

              <P>(ii) If you are ineligible and a policy has been terminated in accordance with section <PRTPAGE P="135"/>2(f)(2), you will not receive any indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment, if applicable, and such ineligibility and termination of the policy may affect your eligibility for benefits under other USDA programs. Any indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that may be owed for the policy before it has been terminated will remain owed to you, but may be offset in accordance with section 2(e), unless your policy was terminated in accordance with sections 2(f)(2)(i)(A), (B) or (D).</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to termination:</P>
              <P>(i) Termination will be effective on:</P>
              <P>(A) For a policy with unpaid administrative fees or premiums, the termination date immediately subsequent to the billing date for the crop year (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity, prevented planting or replanting payment will be owed);</P>
              <P>(B) For a policy with other amounts due, the termination date immediately following the date you have a delinquent debt (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity, prevented planting or replanting payment will be owed);</P>
              <P>(C) For all other policies that are issued by us under the authority of the Act, the termination date that coincides with the termination date for the policy with the delinquent debt or, if there is no coincidental termination date, the termination date immediately following the date you become ineligible; or</P>

              <P>(D) For execution of a written payment agreement and failure to make any scheduled payment, the termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which you failed to make the scheduled payment (for this purpose only, the crop year will start the day after the termination date and end on the next termination date, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> if the termination date is November 30 and you fail to make a payment on November 15, 2019, your policy will terminate on November 30, 2018, for the 2019 crop year); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For all policies terminated under sections 2(f)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (D), any indemnities, prevented planting payments or replanting payments paid subsequent to the termination date must be repaid.</P>
              <P>(iii) Once the policy is terminated, it cannot be reinstated for the current crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(A) The termination was in error;</P>
              <P>(B) The Administrator of the Risk Management Agency, at his or her sole discretion, determines that the following are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) In accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC issued procedures, you provide documentation that your failure to pay your debt is due to an unforeseen or unavoidable event or an extraordinary weather event that created an impossible situation for you to make timely payment;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us or FCIC with your request submitted in accordance with section 2(f)(2)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us no later than 60 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation; or</P>
              <P>(C) We determine that, in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC issued procedures, the following are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You can demonstrate:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) You made timely payment for the amount of premium owed but you inadvertently omitted some small amount, such as the most recent month's interest or a small administrative fee;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The amount of the payment was clearly transposed from the amount that was otherwise due (For example, you owed $892 but you paid $829); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) You timely made the full payment of the amount owed but the delivery of that payment was delayed, and was postmarked no more than seven calendar days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice to you of an amount due, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us in accordance <PRTPAGE P="136"/>with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and applicable procedures no later than 30 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation.</P>
              <P>(iv) A determination made under:</P>
              <P>(A) Section 2(f)(2)(iii)(B) may only be appealed to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11; and</P>
              <P>(B) Section 2(f)(2)(iii)(C) may only be appealed in accordance with section 20.</P>
              <P>(3) To regain eligibility, you must:</P>
              <P>(i) Repay the delinquent debt in full;</P>
              <P>(ii) Execute a written payment agreement, in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and make payments in accordance with the agreement; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.</P>
              <P>(4) After you become eligible for crop insurance, if you want to obtain coverage for your crops, you must submit a new application on or before the sales closing date for the crop (Since applications for crop insurance cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the next crop year).</P>
              <P>(5) For example, for the 2019 crop year, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 2018, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 2019, are insured and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination date, you are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 2018, and crop A's policy is terminated as of that date. Crop B's policy does not terminate until March 15, 2019, and an indemnity for the 2018 crop year may still be owed. If you enter into a written payment agreement on September 25, 2019, the earliest date by which you can obtain crop insurance for crop A is to apply for crop insurance by the October 31, 2019, sales closing date and for crop B is to apply for crop insurance by the March 15, 2020, sales closing date. If you fail to make a payment that was scheduled to be made on April 1, 2020, your policy will terminate as of October 31, 2019, for crop A, and March 15, 2020, for crop B, and no indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment will be due for that crop year for either crop. You will not be eligible to apply for crop insurance for any crop until after the amounts owed are paid in full or you have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.</P>
              <P>(6) If you are determined to be ineligible under section 2(f), persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you may also be ineligible until you become eligible again.</P>
              <P>(g) In cases where there has been a death, disappearance, judicially declared incompetence, or dissolution of any insured person:</P>
              <P>(1) If any married individual insured dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, the named insured on the policy will automatically convert to the name of the spouse if:</P>
              <P>(i) The spouse was included on the policy as having a substantial beneficial interest in the named insured; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The spouse has a share of the crop.</P>
              <P>(2) The provisions in section 2(g)(3) will be applicable if:</P>
              <P>(i) Any partner, member, shareholder, <E T="03">etc.,</E> of an insured entity dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, and such event automatically dissolves the entity; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An individual, whose estate is left to a beneficiary other than a spouse or left to the spouse and the criteria in section 2(g)(1) are not met, dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent.</P>
              <P>(3) If section 2(g)(2) applies and the death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence occurred:</P>
              <P>(i) More than 30 days before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Thirty days or less before the cancellation date, or after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted prior to the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and</P>
              <P>(B) Any indemnity, replanting payment or prevented planting payment will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment and such person or persons must comply with all policy provisions and pay the premium.</P>
              <P>(4) If any insured entity is dissolved for reasons other than death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence:</P>
              <P>(i) Before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or</P>

              <P>(ii) On or after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the <PRTPAGE P="137"/>crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted prior to the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and</P>
              <P>(B) Any indemnity, replanting payment or prevented planting payment will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment and such person or persons must comply with all policy provisions and pay the premium.</P>
              <P>(5) If section 2(g)(2) or (4) applies, a remaining member of the insured person or the beneficiary is required to report to us the death, disappearance, judicial incompetence, or other event that causes dissolution not later than the next cancellation date, except if section 2(g)(3)(ii) applies, notice must be provided by the cancellation date for the next crop year. If notice is not provided timely, the provisions of section 2(g)(2) or (4) will apply retroactive to the date such notice should have been provided and any payments made after the date the policy should have been canceled must be returned.</P>
              <P>(h) We may cancel your policy if no premium is earned for 3 consecutive years.</P>
              <P>(i) The cancellation and termination dates are contained in the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(j) Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or such other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign. You are still responsible for the accuracy of all information provided on your behalf and may be subject to the consequences in section 6(g), and any other applicable consequences, if any information has been misreported.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices</HD>
              <P>(a) Unless adjusted or limited in accordance with your policy, the production guarantee or amount of insurance, coverage level, and price at which an indemnity will be determined for each unit will be those used to calculate your summary of coverage for each crop year.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to the insurance choices:</P>
              <P>(1) For all acreage of the insured crop in the county, unless one of the conditions in section 3(b)(2) exists, you must select the same:</P>
              <P>(i) Plan of insurance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> yield protection, revenue protection, actual production history, amount of insurance, <E T="03">etc.</E>);</P>
              <P>(ii) Level of coverage (all catastrophic risk protection or the same level of additional coverage); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Percentage of the available price election, or projected price for yield protection. For revenue protection, the percentage of price is specified in section 3(c)(2). If different prices are provided by type or variety, insurance will be based on the price provided for each type or variety and the same price percentage will apply to all types or varieties.</P>
              <P>(2) You do not have to select the same plan of insurance, level of coverage or percentage of available price election or projected price if:</P>
              <P>(i) The applicable Crop Provisions allow you the option to separately insure individual crop types or varieties. In this case, each individual type or variety insured by you will be subject to separate administrative fees. For example, if two grape varieties in California are insured under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement and two varieties are insured under an additional coverage policy, a separate administrative fee will be charged for each of the four varieties; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You have additional coverage for the crop in the county and the acreage has been designated as “high-risk” by FCIC. In such case, you will be able to exclude coverage for the high-risk land under the additional coverage policy and insure such acreage under a separate Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, provided the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is obtained from the same insurance provider from which the additional coverage was obtained. If you have revenue protection and exclude high-risk land, the catastrophic risk protection coverage will be yield protection only for the excluded high-risk land.</P>
              <P>(iii) You have additional coverage for the crop in the county, and the actuarial documents provide for separate coverage by irrigated and non-irrigated practices for the crop.</P>
              <P>(A) You may select one coverage level for all irrigated acreage and one coverage level for all non-irrigated acreage. For example: You may choose a 65 percent coverage level for all irrigated acreage (corn irrigated practice) and an 80 percent coverage level for all non-irrigated acreage (corn non-irrigated practice).</P>
              <P>(B) If the Crop Provisions allow the option to separately insure individual crop types or varieties, and the actuarial documents provide for separate coverage, you may select coverage levels by irrigated and non-irrigated practice for each separate type or variety.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to revenue protection, if available for the crop:</P>

              <P>(1) You may change to another plan of insurance and change your coverage level or <PRTPAGE P="138"/>elect the harvest price exclusion by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop;</P>
              <P>(2) Your projected price and harvest price will be 100 percent of the projected price and harvest price issued by FCIC;</P>
              <P>(3) If the harvest price exclusion is:</P>
              <P>(i) Not elected, your projected price is used to initially determine the revenue protection guarantee (per acre), and if the harvest price is greater than the projected price, the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) will be recomputed using your harvest price; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Elected, your projected price is used to compute your revenue protection guarantee (per acre);</P>
              <P>(4) Your projected price is used to calculate your premium, any replanting payment, and any prevented planting payment; and</P>
              <P>(5) If the projected price or harvest price cannot be calculated for the current crop year under the provisions contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) For the projected price:</P>
              <P>(A) Revenue protection will not be provided and you will automatically be covered under the yield protection plan of insurance for the current crop year unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date;</P>
              <P>(B) Notice will be provided on RMA's website by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions;</P>
              <P>(C) The projected price will be determined by FCIC and will be released by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions; and</P>
              <P>(D) Your coverage will automatically revert to revenue protection for the next crop year that revenue protection is available unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your coverage by the sales closing date; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For the harvest price:</P>
              <P>(A) Revenue protection will continue to be available; and</P>
              <P>(B) The harvest price will be determined and announced by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(d) With respect to yield protection, if available for the crop:</P>
              <P>(1) You may change to another plan of insurance and change your percentage of price and your coverage level by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop;</P>
              <P>(2) The percentage of the projected price selected by you multiplied by the projected price issued by FCIC is your projected price that is used to compute the value of your production guarantee (per acre) and the value of the production to count; and</P>

              <P>(3) Since the projected price may change each year, if you do not select a new percentage of the projected price on or before the sales closing date, we will assign a percentage which bears the same relationship to the percentage that was in effect for the preceding year (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you selected 100 percent of the projected price for the previous crop year and you do not select a new percentage for the current crop year, we will assign 100 percent for the current crop year).</P>

              <P>(e) With respect to all plans of insurance other than revenue protection and yield protection (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> APH, dollar amount plans of insurance, <E T="03">etc.</E>):</P>
              <P>(1) In addition to the price election or amount of insurance available on the contract change date, we may provide an additional price election or amount of insurance no later than 15 days prior to the sales closing date.</P>
              <P>(i) You must select the additional price election or amount of insurance on or before the sales closing date for the insured crop.</P>
              <P>(ii) These additional price elections or amounts of insurance will not be less than those available on the contract change date.</P>
              <P>(iii) If you elect the additional price election or amount of insurance, any claim settlement and amount of premium will be based on your additional price election or amount of insurance.</P>
              <P>(2) You may change to another plan of insurance or change your coverage level, amount of insurance or percentage of the price election, as applicable, for the following crop year by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop.</P>
              <P>(3) Your amount of insurance will be the amount of insurance issued by FCIC multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elected. Your price election will be the price election issued by FCIC multiplied by the percentage of price you elected.</P>

              <P>(4) Since the amount of insurance or price election may change each year, if you do not select a new amount of insurance or percentage of the price election on or before the sales closing date, we will assign an amount of insurance or percentage of the price election which bears the same relationship to the amount of insurance or percentage of the price election that was in effect for the preceding year (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you selected 100 percent of the price election for the previous crop year and you do not select a new percentage of the price election for the current crop year, we will assign 100 percent of the price election for the current crop year).</P>
              <P>(f) You must report all production of the crop (insured and uninsured) to us for the previous crop year by the earlier of the acreage reporting date or 45 days after the cancellation date, unless otherwise stated in the Special Provisions or as specified in section 18:</P>

              <P>(1) If you do not provide the required production report, we will assign a yield. The yield assigned by us will not be more than 75 <PRTPAGE P="139"/>percent of the yield used by us to determine your coverage for the previous crop year. The production report or assigned yield will be used to compute your approved yield for the purpose of determining your coverage for the current crop year.</P>
              <P>(2) If you have filed a claim for any crop year, the documents signed by you which state the amount of production used to complete the claim for indemnity will be the production report for that year unless otherwise specified by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(3) Production and acreage for the prior crop year must be reported for each proposed optional unit by the production reporting date, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. If you do not provide the information stated above, the optional units will be combined into the basic unit.</P>
              <P>(4) Appraisals obtained from only a portion of the acreage in a field that remains unharvested after the remainder of the crop within the field has been destroyed or put to another use will not be used to establish your actual yield unless representative samples are required to be left by you in accordance with the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(g) It is your responsibility to accurately report all information that is used to determine your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(1) You must certify to the accuracy of this information on your production report.</P>
              <P>(2) If you fail to accurately report any information or if you do not provide any required records, you will be subject to the provisions regarding misreporting contained in section 6(g), unless the information is corrected:</P>
              <P>(i) On or before the production reporting date;</P>
              <P>(ii) Because the incorrect information was determined to be inadvertently reported by you (Simply stating the error was inadvertent is not sufficient to prove the error was inadvertent); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Because the incorrect information was the result of our error or the error of someone from USDA.</P>
              <P>(3) If you do not have written verifiable records to support the information you certified on your production report, you will receive an assigned yield in accordance with section 3(f)(1) and 7 CFR part 400, subpart G, for the applicable units, determined by us, for those crop years for which you do not have such records. If the conditions of section 34(b)(3) are not met, you will receive an assigned yield for the applicable basic unit.</P>
              <P>(4) At any time we discover you have misreported any material information used to determine your approved yield or your approved yield is not correct, the following actions will be taken, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) We will correct your approved yield, in accordance with FCIC procedure, by assigning a yield or by using the yield we determine to be correct, for the crop year such information is not correct, and all subsequent crop years;</P>
              <P>(ii) We will correct the unit structure, if necessary;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any overpaid or underpaid indemnity or premium must be repaid; and</P>
              <P>(iv) You will be subject to the provisions regarding misreporting contained in section 6(g)(1), unless the incorrect information was the result of our error or the error of someone from USDA.</P>
              <P>(h) In addition to any consequences in section 3(g), at any time the circumstances described below are discovered, your approved yield will be adjusted:</P>
              <P>(1) By including an assigned yield determined in accordance with section 3(f)(1) and 7 CFR part 400, subpart G, if the actual yield reported in the database is excessive for any crop year, as determined by FCIC under its procedures, and you do not provide verifiable records to support the yield in the database (If there are verifiable records for the yield in your database, the yield is significantly different from the other yields in the county or your other yields for the crop and you cannot prove there is a valid agronomic basis to support the differences in the yields, the yield will be the average of the yields for the crop or the applicable county transitional yield if you have no other yields for the crop);</P>
              <P>(2) By reducing it to an amount consistent with the average of the approved yields for other databases for your farming operation with the same crop, type, and practice or the county transitional yield, as applicable, if:</P>
              <P>(i) The approved APH yield is greater than 115 percent of the average of the approved yields of all applicable databases for your farming operation that have actual yields in them or it is greater than 115 percent of the county transitional yield if no applicable databases exist for comparison;</P>
              <P>(ii) The current year's insurable acreage (including applicable prevented planting acreage) is greater than 400 percent of the average number of acres in the database or the acres contained in two or more individual years in the database are each less than 10 percent of the current year's insurable acreage in the unit (including applicable prevented planting acreage); and</P>
              <P>(iii) We determine there is no valid agronomic basis to support the approved yield; or</P>

              <P>(3) To an amount consistent with the production methods actually carried out for the crop year if you use a different production method than was previously used and the production method actually carried out is likely to result in a yield lower than the average of your previous actual yields. The yield will be adjusted based on your other units where such production methods were carried out or to the applicable county transitional yield for the production methods if <PRTPAGE P="140"/>other such units do not exist. You must notify us of changes in your production methods by the acreage reporting date. If you fail to notify us, in addition to the reduction of your approved yield described herein, you will be considered to have misreported information and you will be subject to the consequences in section 6(g). For example, for a non-irrigated unit, your yield is based upon acreage of the crop that is watered once prior to planting, and the crop is not watered prior to planting for the current crop year. Your approved APH yield will be reduced to an amount consistent with the actual production history of your other non-irrigated units where the crop has not been watered prior to planting or limited to the non-irrigated transitional yield for the unit if other such units do not exist.</P>
              <P>(i) Unless you meet the double cropping requirements contained in section 17(f)(4), if you elect to plant a second crop on acreage where the first insured crop was prevented from being planted, you will receive a yield equal to 60 percent of the approved yield for the first insured crop to calculate your average yield for subsequent crop years (Not applicable to crops if the APH is not the basis for the insurance guarantee). If the unit contains both prevented planting and planted acreage of the same crop, the yield for such acreage will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured prevented planting acres by 60 percent of the approved yield for the first insured crop;</P>
              <P>(2) Adding the totals from section 3(i)(1) to the amount of appraised or harvested production for all of the insured planted acreage; and</P>
              <P>(3) Dividing the total in section 3(i)(2) by the total number of acres in the unit.</P>
              <P>(j) Hail and fire coverage may be excluded from the covered causes of loss for an insured crop only if you select additional coverage of not less than 65 percent of the approved yield indemnified at the 100 percent price election, or an equivalent coverage as established by FCIC, and you have purchased the same or a higher dollar amount of coverage for hail and fire from us or any other source. If you elected a whole-farm unit, you may exclude hail and fire coverage only if allowed by the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(k) The applicable premium rate, or formula to calculate the premium rate, and transitional yield will be those contained in the actuarial documents except, in the case of high-risk land, a written agreement may be requested to change such transitional yield or premium rate.</P>
              <P>(l) Notwithstanding any other provision, if you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher and were previously involved in a farming or ranching operation, including involvement in the decision-making or physical involvement in the production of the crop or livestock on the farm, for any acreage obtained by you, you may receive a yield that is the higher of:</P>
              <P>(1) The actual production history of the previous producer of the crop or livestock on the acreage you were previously involved with; or</P>
              <P>(2) Your actual production history.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>(a) We may change the terms of your coverage under this policy from year to year.</P>

              <P>(b) Any changes in policy provisions, amounts of insurance, premium rates, program dates, price elections or the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable, can be viewed on RMA's website not later than the contract change date contained in the Crop Provisions (except as allowed herein or as specified in section 3). We may only revise this information after the contract change date to correct clear errors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the price for oats was announced at $25.00 per bushel instead of $2.50 per bushel or the final planting date should be May 10 but the final planting date in the Special Provisions states August 10).</P>
              <P>(c) After the contract change date, all changes specified in section 4(b) will also be available upon request from your crop insurance agent. You will be provided, in writing, a copy of the changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable, and Special Provisions not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop. If available from us, you may elect to receive these documents and changes electronically. Acceptance of the changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage.</P>

              <P>(a) An annual acreage report must be submitted to us on our form for each insured crop in the county on or before the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If you insure multiple crops with us that have final planting dates on or after August 15 but before December 31, you must submit an acreage report for all such crops on or before the latest applicable acreage reporting date for such crops; and</P>

              <P>(2) If you insure multiple crops with us that have final planting dates on or after December 31 but before August 15, you must submit an acreage report for all such crops on or before the latest applicable acreage reporting date for such crops.<PRTPAGE P="141"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions in sections 6(a) (1) and (2):</P>
              <P>(i) If the Special Provisions designate separate planting periods for a crop, you must submit an acreage report for each planting period on or before the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for the planting period;</P>
              <P>(ii) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting date or you are prevented from planting during the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:</P>
              <P>(A) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions;</P>
              <P>(B) The date determined in accordance with sections (a)(1) or (2); or</P>
              <P>(C) Five days after the end of the late planting period for the insured crop, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(iii) If you plant the insured crop on or within five days prior to the final planting date and the final planting date is five or fewer days prior to the acreage reporting date, you must submit an acreage report no later than five days after the acreage reporting date (for example, if the final planting date contained in the Special Provisions is July 10, the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions is July 15 and you plant the insured crop on July 9, you have until July 20 to submit an acreage report for the insured crop).</P>
              <P>(b) If you do not have a share in an insured crop in the county for the crop year, you must submit an acreage report, on or before the acreage reporting date, so indicating.</P>
              <P>(c) Your acreage report must include the following information, if applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount of acreage of the crop in the county (insurable and not insurable) in which you have a share and the date the insured crop was planted on the unit as follows:</P>

              <P>(ii) The date of planting and the number of acres planted per day for acreage planted during the late planting period (If you fail to report the number of acres planted on a daily basis, all acreage planted in the late planting period will be presumed to have been planted on the last day planting took place in the late planting period for the purposes of section 16);</P>
              <P>(2) Your share at the time coverage begins;</P>

              <P>(d) Regarding the ability to revise an acreage report you have submitted to us:</P>
              <P>(1) For planted acreage, you cannot revise any information pertaining to the planted acreage after the acreage reporting date without our consent (Consent may only be provided when no cause of loss has occurred; our appraisal has determined that the insured crop will produce at least 90 percent of the yield used to determine your guarantee or the amount of insurance for the unit (including reported and unreported acreage), except when there are unreported units (see section 6(f)); the information on the acreage report is clearly transposed; you provide adequate evidence that we or someone from USDA have committed an error regarding the information on your acreage report; or if expressly permitted by the policy);</P>
              <P>(2) For prevented planting acreage:</P>

              <P>(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you can change any information on any initially submitted acreage report, except as provided in section 6(d)(2)(iii) (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> you can correct the reported share, add acreage of the insured crop that was prevented from being planted, <E T="03">etc.</E>);</P>

              <P>(ii) After the acreage reporting date, you cannot revise any information on the acreage report (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you have failed to report prevented planting acreage on or before the acreage reporting date, you cannot revise it after the acreage reporting date to include prevented planting acreage) but we will revise information that is clearly transposed or if you provide adequate evidence that we or someone from USDA have committed an error regarding the information on your acreage report; and</P>
              <P>(iii) You cannot revise your initially submitted acreage report at any time to change the insured crop, or type, that was reported as prevented from being planted;</P>
              <P>(3) You may request an acreage measurement from FSA or a business that provides such measurement service prior to the acreage reporting date, submit documentation of such request and an acreage report with estimated acreage by the acreage reporting date, and if the acreage measurement shows the estimated acreage was incorrect, we will revise your acreage report to reflect the correct acreage:</P>
              <P>(i) If an acreage measurement is only requested for a portion of the acreage within a unit, you must separately designate the acreage for which an acreage measurement has been requested;</P>
              <P>(ii) If an acreage measurement is not provided to us by the time we receive a notice of loss, we may:</P>
              <P>(A) Defer finalization of the claim until the measurement is completed, and:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Make all necessary loss determinations, except the acreage measurement; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Finalize the claim in accordance with applicable policy provisions after you provide the acreage measurement to us (If you fail to provide the measurement, your claim will not be paid); or</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Estimated acreage under this section will not be accepted from you for any subsequent acreage report; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Premium will still be due in accordance with sections 2(e) and 7. If the acreage is not measured as specified in section 6(d)(3)(ii) and the acreage measurement is not provided to us at least 15 days prior to the premium billing date, your premium will be based on the estimated acreage and will be revised, if necessary, when the acreage measurement is provided. If the acreage measurement is not provided by the termination date, you will be precluded from providing any estimated acreage for all subsequent crop years.</P>
              <P>(4) If there is an irreconcilable difference between:</P>
              <P>(i) The acreage measured by FSA or a measuring service and our on-farm measurement, our on-farm measurement will be used; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The acreage measured by a measuring service, other than our on-farm measurement, and FSA, the FSA measurement will be used; and</P>
              <P>(5) If the acreage report has been revised in accordance with section 6(d)(1), (2), or (3), the information on the initial acreage report will not be considered misreported for the purposes of section 6(g).</P>
              <P>(e) We may elect to determine all premiums and indemnities based on the information you submit on the acreage report or upon the factual circumstances we determine to have existed, subject to the provisions contained in section 6(g).</P>
              <P>(f) If you do not submit an acreage report by the acreage reporting date, or if you fail to report all units, we may elect to determine by unit the insurable crop acreage, share, type and practice, or to deny liability on such units. If we deny liability for the unreported units, your share of any production from the unreported units will be allocated, for loss purposes only, as production to count to the reported units in proportion to the liability on each reported unit. However, such production will not be allocated to prevented planting acreage or otherwise affect any prevented planting payment.</P>
              <P>(g) You must provide all required reports and you are responsible for the accuracy of all information contained in those reports. You should verify the information on all such reports prior to submitting them to us.</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in section 6(g)(2), if you submit information on any report that is different than what is determined to be correct and such information results in:</P>
              <P>(i) A lower liability than the actual liability determined, the production guarantee or amount of insurance on the unit will be reduced to an amount consistent with the reported information (In the event the insurable acreage is under-reported for any unit, all production or value from insurable acreage in that unit will be considered production or value to count in determining the indemnity); or</P>
              <P>(ii) A higher liability than the actual liability determined, the information contained in the acreage report will be revised to be consistent with the correct information.</P>
              <P>(2) If your share is misreported and the share is:</P>
              <P>(i) Under-reported, any claim will be determined using the share you reported; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Over-reported, any claim will be determined using the share we determine to be correct.</P>
              <P>(h) If we discover you have incorrectly reported any information on the acreage report for any crop year, you may be required to provide documentation in subsequent crop years substantiating your report of acreage for those crop years, including, but not limited to, an acreage measurement service at your own expense. If the correction of any misreported information would affect an indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that was paid in a prior crop year, such claim will be adjusted and you will be required to repay any overpaid amounts.</P>
              <P>(i) Errors in reporting units may be corrected by us at the time of adjusting a loss to reduce our liability and to conform to applicable unit division guidelines.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees</HD>
              <P>(a) The annual premium is earned and payable at the time coverage begins. You will be billed for the premium and administrative fee not earlier than the premium billing date specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) Premium or administrative fees owed by you will be offset from an indemnity or prevented planting payment due you in accordance with section 2(e).</P>
              <P>(c) The annual premium amount is determined, as applicable, by either:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the production guarantee per acre times your price election or your projected price, as applicable, times the premium rate, times the insured acreage, times your share at the time coverage begins, and times any premium adjustment percentages that may apply; or</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying your amount of insurance per acre times the premium rate, times the insured acreage, times your share at the time coverage begins, and times any premium adjustment percentages that may apply.</P>
              <P>(d) The information needed to determine the premium rate and any premium adjustment percentages that may apply are contained in the actuarial documents or an approved written agreement.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) You, unless otherwise authorized in 7 CFR part 400, must pay an administrative fee each crop year of $30 per crop per county for all levels of coverage in excess of catastrophic risk protection.</P>
              <P>(2) The administrative fee must be paid no later than the time that premium is due.</P>
              <P>(3) Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop. If you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be subject to criminal and administrative sanctions.</P>
              <P>(4) The administrative fee will be waived if you request it and:</P>
              <P>(i) You qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher;</P>
              <P>(ii) You qualify as a limited resource farmer; or</P>
              <P>(iii) You were insured prior to the 2005 crop year or for the 2005 crop year and your administrative fee was waived for one or more of those crop years because you qualified as a limited resource farmer under a policy definition previously in effect, and you remain qualified as a limited resource farmer under the definition that was in effect at the time the administrative fee was waived.</P>
              <P>(5) Failure to pay the administrative fees when due may make you ineligible for certain other USDA benefits.</P>
              <P>(f) If the amount of premium (gross premium less premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC) and administrative fee you are required to pay for any acreage exceeds the liability for the acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium or administrative fee will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).</P>
              <P>(g) If you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, your premium subsidy will be 10 percentage points greater than the premium subsidy that you would otherwise receive, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(h) You will be ineligible for any premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC for any policy issued by us if:</P>
              <P>(1) USDA determines you have committed a violation of the highly erodible land conservation or wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12 as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014; or</P>
              <P>(2) You have not filed form AD-1026 with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date.</P>

              <P>(A) For the initial reinsurance year if you certify by the premium billing date for your policy that you meet the qualifications as outlined in FCIC approved procedures for producers who are new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new entity, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026; or</P>
              <P>(B) If FSA approves relief for failure to timely file due to circumstances beyond your control or failure to timely provide adequate information to complete form AD-1026 in accordance with the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 12.</P>
              <P>(ii) To be eligible for premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC, it is your responsibility to assure you meet all the requirements for:</P>
              <P>(A) Compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 7(h)(1) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) Filing form AD-1026 to be properly identified as in compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 7(h)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) The insured crop will be that shown on your accepted application and as specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions and must be grown on insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(b) A crop which will NOT be insured will include, but will not be limited to, any crop:</P>
              <P>(1) That is not grown on planted acreage (except for the purposes of prevented planting coverage), or that is a type, class or variety or where the conditions under which the crop is planted are not generally recognized for the area (For example, where agricultural experts determine that planting a non-irrigated corn crop after a failed small grain crop on the same acreage in the same crop year is not appropriate for the area);</P>

              <P>(2) For which the information necessary for insurance (price election, amount of insurance, projected price and harvest price, as applicable, premium rate, <E T="03">etc.</E>) is not included in the actuarial documents, unless such information is provided by a written agreement in accordance with section 18;</P>
              <P>(3) That is a volunteer crop;</P>
              <P>(4) Planted following the same crop on the same acreage and the first planting of the crop has been harvested in the same crop year unless specifically permitted by the Crop Provisions or the Special Provisions (For example, the second planting of grain sorghum would not be insurable if grain sorghum had already been planted and harvested on the same acreage during the crop year);</P>
              <P>(5) That is planted for the development or production of hybrid seed or for experimental purposes, unless permitted by the Crop Provisions or by written agreement to insure such crop; or</P>
              <P>(6) That is used solely for wildlife protection or management. If the lease states that specific acreage must remain unharvested, only that acreage is uninsurable. If the lease specifies that a percentage of the crop must be left unharvested, your share will be reduced by such percentage.</P>

              <P>(c) Although certain policy documents may state that a crop type, class, variety or <PRTPAGE P="144"/>practice is not insurable, it does not mean all other crop types, classes, varieties or practices are insurable. To be insurable the crop type, class, variety or practice must meet all the conditions in this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>(a) All acreage planted to the insured crop in the county in which you have a share:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in section 9(a)(2), is insurable if the acreage has been planted and harvested or insured (including insured acreage that was prevented from being planted) in any one of the three previous crop years. Acreage that has not been planted and harvested (grazing is not considered harvested for the purposes of section 9(a)(1)) or insured in at least one of the three previous crop years may still be insurable if:</P>
              <P>(i) Such acreage was not planted:</P>
              <P>(A) In at least two of the three previous crop years to comply with any other USDA program;</P>

              <P>(B) Due to the crop rotation, the acreage would not have been planted in the previous three years (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a crop rotation of corn, soybeans, and alfalfa; and the alfalfa remained for four years before the acreage was planted to corn again); or</P>
              <P>(C) Because a perennial tree, vine, or bush crop was on the acreage in at least two of the previous three crop years;</P>
              <P>(ii) Such acreage constitutes five percent or less of the insured planted acreage in the unit;</P>
              <P>(iii) Such acreage was not planted or harvested because it was pasture or rangeland, the crop to be insured is also pasture or rangeland, and the Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, or a written agreement specifically allow insurance for such acreage; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, or a written agreement specifically allow insurance for such acreage; or</P>
              <P>(2) Is not insurable if:</P>
              <P>(i) The only crop that has been planted and harvested on the acreage in the three previous crop years is a cover, hay (except wheat harvested for hay) or forage crop (except insurable silage). However, such acreage may be insurable only if:</P>
              <P>(A) The crop to be insured is a hay or forage crop and the Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, or a written agreement specifically allow insurance for such acreage; or</P>
              <P>(B) The hay or forage crop was part of a crop rotation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The acreage has been strip-mined. However, such acreage may be insurable only if:</P>
              <P>(A) An agricultural commodity, other than a cover, hay (except wheat harvested for hay), or forage crop (except insurable silage) has been harvested from the acreage for at least five crop years after the strip-mined land was reclaimed; or</P>
              <P>(B) A written agreement specifically allows insurance for such acreage;</P>
              <P>(iii) The actuarial documents do not provide the information necessary to determine the premium rate, unless insurance is allowed by a written agreement;</P>
              <P>(iv) The insured crop is damaged and it is practical to replant the insured crop, but the insured crop is not replanted;</P>
              <P>(v) The acreage is interplanted, unless insurance is allowed by the Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(vi) The acreage is otherwise restricted by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions;</P>
              <P>(vii) The acreage is planted in any manner other than as specified in the policy provisions for the crop unless a written agreement specifically allows insurance for such planting;</P>

              <P>(viii) The acreage is of a second crop, if you elect not to insure such acreage when an indemnity for a first insured crop may be subject to reduction in accordance with the provisions of section 15 and you intend to collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop acreage. This election must be made on a first insured crop unit basis (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if the first insured crop unit contains 40 planted acres that may be subject to an indemnity reduction, then no second crop can be insured on any of the 40 acres). In this case:</P>
              <P>(A) If the first insured crop is insured under this policy, you must provide written notice to us of your election not to insure acreage of a second crop at the time the first insured crop acreage is released by us (if no acreage in the first insured crop unit is released, this election must be made by the earlier of the acreage reporting date for the second crop or when you sign the claim for indemnity for the first insured crop) or, if the first insured crop is insured under Area Risk Protection Insurance (7 CFR part 407), this election must be made before the second crop insured under this policy is planted, and if you fail to provide such notice, the second crop acreage will be insured in accordance with the applicable policy provisions and you must repay any overpaid indemnity for the first insured crop;</P>
              <P>(B) In the event a second crop is planted and insured with a different insurance provider, or planted and insured by a different person, you must provide written notice to each insurance provider that a second crop was planted on acreage on which you had a first insured crop; and</P>
              <P>(C) You must report the crop acreage that will not be insured on the applicable acreage report; or</P>

              <P>(ix) The acreage is of a crop planted following a second crop or following an insured crop that is prevented from being planted after a first insured crop, unless it is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts for the area to plant three or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same <PRTPAGE P="145"/>crop year, and additional coverage insurance provided under the authority of the Act is offered for the third or subsequent crop in the same crop year. Insurance will only be provided for a third or subsequent crop as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) You must provide records acceptable to us that show:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You have produced and harvested the insured crop following two other crops harvested on the same acreage in the same crop year in at least two of the last four years in which you produced the insured crop; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The applicable acreage has had three or more crops produced and harvested on it in the same crop year in at least two of the last four years in which the insured crop was grown on the acreage; and</P>
              <P>(B) The amount of insurable acreage will not exceed 100 percent of the greatest number of acres for which you provide the records required in section 9(a)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
              <P>(b) If insurance is provided for an irrigated practice, you must report as irrigated only that acreage for which you have adequate facilities and adequate water, or the reasonable expectation of receiving adequate water at the time coverage begins, to carry out a good irrigation practice. If you knew or had reason to know that your water may be reduced before coverage begins, no reasonable expectation exists.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding the provisions in section 8(b)(2), if acreage is irrigated and a premium rate is not provided for an irrigated practice, you may either report and insure the irrigated acreage as “non-irrigated,” or report the irrigated acreage as not insured (If you elect to insure such acreage under a non-irrigated practice, your irrigated yield will only be used to determine your approved yield if you continue to use a good irrigation practice. If you do not use a good irrigation practice, you will receive a yield determined in accordance with section 3(h)(3)).</P>
              <P>(d) We may restrict the amount of acreage that we will insure to the amount allowed under any acreage limitation program established by the United States Department of Agriculture if we notify you of that restriction prior to the sales closing date.</P>
              <P>(e) Except as provided in section 9(f), and in accordance with section 9(g), in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, or South Dakota, native sod acreage may be insured if the requirements of section 9(a) have been met but will:</P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding the provisions in section 3 regarding your production guarantee, receive a production guarantee (per acre) that is based on 65 percent of the transitional yield for the county; and</P>
              <P>(2) For additional coverage policies, receive a premium subsidy that is 50 percentage points less than would otherwise be provided on acreage not qualifying as native sod. If the premium subsidy applicable to these acres is less than 50 percent before the reduction, you will receive no premium subsidy.</P>
              <P>(f) Section 9(e) is not applicable to cumulative native sod acreage that is five acres or less in the county.</P>
              <P>(g) Section 9(e) is applicable during the first 4 crop years of planting on native sod acreage that has been tilled beginning on February 8, 2014, and ending on December 20, 2018. Section 9(e) is applicable during 4 cumulative crop years of insurance within the first 10 crop years after initial tillage on native sod acreage tilled after December 20, 2018.</P>

              <P>(ii) The application clearly states you as a landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as a tenant will insure your landlord's share. If you as a landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as a tenant will insure your landlord's share, you must provide evidence of the other party's approval (lease, power of attorney, <E T="03">etc.</E>) and such evidence will be retained by us:</P>
              <P>(A) You also must clearly set forth the percentage shares of each person on the acreage report; and</P>

              <P>(i) Your spouse, unless such spouse can prove he/she has a separate farming operation, which includes, but is not limited to, separate land (transfers of acreage from one spouse to another is not considered separate land), separate capital, separate inputs, separate accounting, and separate maintenance of proceeds; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Your child who resides in your household or any other member of your household, unless such child or other member of the household can demonstrate such person has a separate share in the crop (Children who do not reside in your household are not included in your share); and<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If it is determined that the spouse, child or other member of the household has a separate policy but does not have a separate farming operation or share of the crop, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) The policy for one spouse or child or other member of the household will be void and the policy remaining in effect will be determined in accordance with section 22(a)(1) and (2);</P>
              <P>(ii) The acreage or share reported under the policy that is voided will be included under the remaining policy; and</P>
              <P>(iii) No premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for the voided policy.</P>

              <P>(c) Acreage rented for a percentage of the crop, or a lease containing provisions for <E T="03">both</E> a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,) <E T="03">and</E> a crop share will be considered a crop share lease.</P>

              <P>(d) Acreage rented for cash, or a lease containing provisions for <E T="03">either</E> a minimum payment <E T="03">or</E> a crop share (such as a 50/50 share or $100.00 per acre, whichever is greater) will be considered a cash lease.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) Except for prevented planting coverage (see section 17), coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit at the later of:</P>
              <P>(1) The date we accept your application (For the purposes of this paragraph, the date of acceptance is the date that you submit a properly executed application in accordance with section 2);</P>
              <P>(2) The date the insured crop is planted; or</P>
              <P>(3) The calendar date contained in the Crop Provisions for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) Coverage ends on each unit or part of a unit at the earliest of:</P>
              <P>(1) Total destruction of the insured crop;</P>
              <P>(2) Harvest of the insured crop;</P>
              <P>(3) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit;</P>

              <P>(c) Except as provided in the Crop Provisions or applicable endorsement, in addition to the requirements of section 11(b), coverage ends on any acreage within a unit once any event specified in section 11(b) occurs on that acreage. Coverage only remains in effect on acreage that has not been affected by an event specified in section 11(b).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>Insurance is provided only to protect against unavoidable, naturally occurring events. A list of the covered naturally occurring events is contained in the applicable Crop Provisions. All other causes of loss, including but not limited to the following, are not covered:</P>

              <P>(a) Any act by any person that affects the yield, quality or price of the insured crop (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> chemical drift, fire, terrorism, <E T="03">etc.</E>);</P>
              <P>(b) Failure to follow recognized good farming practices for the insured crop;</P>
              <P>(c) Water that is contained by or within structures that are designed to contain a specific amount of water, such as dams, locks or reservoir projects, etc., on any acreage when such water stays within the designed limits (For example, a dam is designed to contain water to an elevation of 1,200 feet but you plant a crop on acreage at an elevation of 1,100 feet. A storm causes the water behind the dam to rise to an elevation of 1,200 feet. Under such circumstances, the resulting damage would not be caused by an insurable cause of loss. However, if you planted on acreage that was above 1,200 feet elevation, any damage caused by water that exceeded that elevation would be caused by an insurable cause of loss);</P>

              <P>(d) Failure or breakdown of the irrigation equipment or facilities, or the inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> furrow irrigation), unless the failure, breakdown or inability is due to a cause of loss specified in the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(1) You must make all reasonable efforts to restore the equipment or facilities to proper working order within a reasonable amount of time unless we determine it is not practical to do so.</P>
              <P>(2) Cost will not be considered when determining whether it is practical to restore the equipment or facilities;</P>
              <P>(e) Failure to carry out a good irrigation practice for the insured crop, if applicable; or</P>
              <P>(f) Any cause of loss that results in damage that is not evident or would not have been evident during the insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that only becomes evident after the end of the insurance period unless expressly authorized in the Crop Provisions. Even though we may not inspect the damaged crop until after the end of the insurance period, damage due to insured causes that would have been evident during the insurance period will be covered.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Replanting Payment</HD>

              <P>(a) If allowed by the Crop Provisions, a replanting payment may be made on an insured crop replanted after we have given consent and the acreage replanted is at least the lesser of 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured planted acreage for the unit (as determined on the final planting date or within the late planting period if a late planting period is applicable). If the crops to be replanted are in a whole-farm unit, the 20 acres or 20 percent requirement is to be applied separately <PRTPAGE P="147"/>to each crop to be replanted in the whole-farm unit.</P>
              <P>(b) No replanting payment will be made on acreage:</P>
              <P>(1) On which our appraisal establishes that production will exceed the level set by the Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Initially planted prior to the earliest planting date established by the Special Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(3) On which one replanting payment has already been allowed for the crop year.</P>
              <P>(c) The replanting payment per acre will be:</P>
              <P>(1) The lesser of your actual cost for replanting or the amount specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions specify that your actual cost will not be used to determine your replanting payment, the amount determined in accordance with the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(d) No replanting payment will be paid if we determine it is not practical to replant.</P>

              <P>Your Duties—</P>
              <P>(a) In the case of damage or loss of production or revenue to any insured crop, you must protect the crop from further damage by providing sufficient care.</P>
              <P>(b) Notice provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) For a planted crop, when there is damage or loss of production, you must give us notice, by unit, within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage or loss of production (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period, even if you have not harvested the crop).</P>
              <P>(2) For crops for which revenue protection is elected, if there is no damage or loss of production, you must give us notice not later than 45 days after the latest date the harvest price is released for any crop in the unit where there is a revenue loss.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event you are prevented from planting an insured crop that has prevented planting coverage, you must notify us within 72 hours after:</P>
              <P>(i) The final planting date, if you do not intend to plant the insured crop during the late planting period or if a late planting period is not applicable; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You determine you will not be able to plant the insured crop within any applicable late planting period.</P>
              <P>(4) All notices required in this section that must be received by us within 72 hours may be made by telephone or in person to your crop insurance agent but must be confirmed in writing within 15 days.</P>
              <P>(5) If you fail to comply with these notice requirements, any loss or prevented planting claim will be considered solely due to an uninsured cause of loss for the acreage for which such failure occurred, unless we determine that we have the ability to accurately adjust the loss. If we determine that we do not have the ability to accurately adjust the loss:</P>
              <P>(i) For any prevented planting claim, no prevented planting coverage will be provided and no premium will be owed or prevented planting payment will be paid; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For any claim for indemnity, no indemnity will be paid but you will still be required to pay all premiums owed.</P>
              <P>(c) Representative samples:</P>
              <P>(1) If representative samples are required by the Crop Provisions, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop intact:</P>
              <P>(i) If you report damage less than 15 days before the time you will begin harvest or during harvest of the damaged unit; or</P>
              <P>(ii) At any time when required by us.</P>
              <P>(2) The samples must be left intact until we inspect them or until 15 days after completion of harvest on the remainder of the unit, whichever is earlier.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, the samples of the crop in each field in the unit must be 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of the rows, if the crop is planted in rows, or if the crop is not planted in rows, the longest dimension of the field.</P>
              <P>(4) The period to retain representative samples may be extended if it is necessary to accurately determine the loss. You will be notified in writing of any such extension.</P>
              <P>(d) Consent:</P>
              <P>(1) You must obtain consent from us before, and notify us after you:</P>
              <P>(i) Destroy any of the insured crop that is not harvested;</P>
              <P>(ii) Put the insured crop to an alternative use;</P>
              <P>(iii) Put the acreage to another use; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Abandon any portion of the insured crop.</P>
              <P>(2) We will not give consent for any of the actions in section 14(d)(1)(i) through (iv) if it is practical to replant the crop or until we have made an appraisal of the potential production of the crop.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure to obtain our consent will result in the assignment of an amount of production or value to count in accordance with the Settlement of Claim provisions of the applicable Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) Claims:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as otherwise provided in your policy, you must submit a claim declaring the amount of your loss by the dates shown in section 14(e)(3), unless you:</P>

              <P>(i) Request an extension in writing by such date and we agree to such request (Extensions will only be granted if the amount of the loss can not be determined within such time period because the information needed <PRTPAGE P="148"/>to determine the amount of the loss is not available); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Have harvested farm-stored grain production and elect, in writing, to delay measurement of your farm-stored production and settlement of any potential associated claim for indemnity (Extensions will be granted for this purpose up to 180 days after the end of the insurance period).</P>
              <P>(A) For policies that require APH, if such extension continues beyond the date you are required to submit your production report, you will be assigned the previous year's approved yield as a temporary yield in accordance with applicable procedures.</P>
              <P>(B) Any extension does not extend any date specified in the policy by which premiums, administrative fees, or other debts owed must be paid.</P>
              <P>(C) Damage that occurs after the end of the insurance period (for example, while the harvested crop production is in storage) is not covered; and</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to timely submit a claim or provide the required information necessary to determine the amount of the claim will result in no indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment:</P>
              <P>(i) Even though no indemnity or replanting payment is due, you will still be required to pay the premium due under the policy for the unit; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure to timely submit a prevented planting claim will result in no prevented planting coverage and no premium will be due.</P>
              <P>(3) You must submit a claim not later than:</P>
              <P>(i) For policies other than revenue protection, 60 days after the date the insurance period ends for all acreage in the unit (When there is acreage in the unit where the insurance period ended on different dates, it is the last date the insurance period ends on the unit. For example, if a unit has corn acreage that was put to another use on July 15 and corn acreage where harvest was completed on September 30, the claim must be submitted not later than 60 days after September 30); or</P>

              <P>(B) The date determined in accordance with section 14(e)(3)(i).</P>
              <P>(4) To receive any indemnity (or receive the rest of an indemnity in the case of acreage that is planted to a second crop), prevented planting payment or replanting payment, you must, if applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) Provide:</P>
              <P>(A) A complete harvesting, production, and marketing record of each insured crop by unit including separate records showing the same information for production from any acreage not insured.</P>
              <P>(B) Records as indicated below if you insure any acreage that may be subject to an indemnity reduction as specified in section 15(e)(2):</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Separate records of production from such acreage for all insured crops planted on the acreage (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you have an insurable loss on 10 acres of wheat and subsequently plant cotton on the same 10 acres, you must provide records of the wheat and cotton production on the 10 acres separate from any other wheat and cotton production that may be planted in the same unit). If you fail to provide separate records for such acreage, we will allocate the production of each crop to the acreage in proportion to our liability for the acreage; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If there is no loss on the unit that includes acreage of the second crop, no separate records need to be submitted for the second crop and you can receive the rest of the indemnity for the first insured crop.</P>

              <P>(ii) Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim, and, as often as we reasonably require:</P>
              <P>(A) Show us the damaged crop;</P>

              <P>(C) That the loss was caused by one or more of the insured causes specified in the Crop Provisions; and</P>
              <P>(D) That you have complied with all provisions of this policy.</P>
              <P>(iv) Upon our request, or that of any USDA employee authorized to conduct investigations of the crop insurance program, submit to an examination under oath.</P>
              <P>(5) Failure to comply with any requirement contained in section 14(e)(4) will result in denial of the claim and any premium will still be owed, unless the claim denied is for prevented planting.</P>
              <P>Our Duties—</P>
              <P>(f) If you have complied with all the policy provisions, we will pay your loss within 30 days after the later of:</P>
              <P>(1) We reach agreement with you;</P>
              <P>(2) Completion of arbitration, reconsideration of determinations regarding good farming practices or any other appeal that results in an award in your favor, unless we exercise our right to appeal such decision;</P>

              <P>(3) Completion of any investigation by USDA, if applicable, of your current or any past claim for indemnity if no evidence of wrongdoing has been found (If any evidence of wrongdoing has been discovered, the <PRTPAGE P="149"/>amount of any indemnity, prevented planting or replant overpayment as a result of such wrongdoing may be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment owed to you); or</P>
              <P>(4) The entry of a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(g) In the event we are unable to pay your loss within 30 days, we will give you notice of our intentions within the 30-day period.</P>
              <P>(h) We may defer the adjustment of a loss until the amount of loss can be accurately determined. We will not pay for additional damage resulting from your failure to provide sufficient care for the crop during the deferral period.</P>
              <P>(i) We recognize and apply the loss adjustment procedures established or approved by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.</P>
              <P>(j) For revenue protection, we may make preliminary indemnity payments for crop production losses prior to the release of the harvest price if you have not elected the harvest price exclusion.</P>
              <P>(1) First, we may pay an initial indemnity based upon your projected price, in accordance with the applicable Crop Provisions provided that your production to count and share have been established; and</P>
              <P>(2) Second, after the harvest price is released, and if it is not equal to the projected price, we will recalculate the indemnity payment and pay any additional indemnity that may be due.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">15. Production Included in Determining an Indemnity and Payment Reductions.</HD>
              <P>(a) The total production to be counted for a unit will include all production determined in accordance with the policy.</P>
              <P>(b) Appraised production will be used to calculate your claim if you are not going to harvest your acreage. Such appraisals may be conducted after the end of the insurance period. If you harvest the crop after the crop has been appraised:</P>
              <P>(1) You must provide us with the amount of harvested production (If you fail to provide verifiable records of harvested production, no indemnity will be paid and you will be required to return any previously paid indemnity for the unit that was based on an appraised amount of production); and</P>
              <P>(2) If the harvested production exceeds the appraised production, claims will be adjusted using the harvested production, and you will be required to repay any overpaid indemnity; or</P>
              <P>(3) If the harvested production is less than the appraised production, and:</P>
              <P>(i) You harvest after the end of the insurance period, your appraised production will be used to adjust the loss unless you can prove that no additional causes of loss or deterioration of the crop occurred after the end of the insurance period; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You harvest before the end of the insurance period, your harvested production will be used to adjust the loss.</P>
              <P>(c) If you elect to exclude hail and fire as insured causes of loss and the insured crop is damaged by hail or fire, appraisals will be made as described in our form used to exclude fire and hail.</P>
              <P>(d) The amount of an indemnity that may be determined under the applicable provisions of your policy may be reduced by an amount, determined in accordance with the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, to reflect out-of-pocket expenses that were not incurred by you as a result of not planting, caring for, or harvesting the crop. Indemnities paid for acreage prevented from being planted will be based on a reduced guarantee as provided for in the policy and will not be further reduced to reflect expenses not incurred.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to acreage where you have suffered an insurable loss to planted acreage of your first insured crop in the crop year, except in the case of double cropping described in section 15(h):</P>
              <P>(1) You may elect to not plant or to plant and not insure a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year and collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop; or</P>
              <P>(2) You may elect to plant and insure a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year (you will pay the full premium and, if there is an insurable loss to the second crop, receive the full amount of indemnity that may be due for the second crop, regardless of whether there is a subsequent crop planted on the same acreage) and:</P>
              <P>(i) Collect an indemnity payment that is 35 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop;</P>
              <P>(ii) Be responsible for premium that is 35 percent of the premium that you would otherwise owe for the first insured crop; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the second crop does not suffer an insurable loss:</P>
              <P>(A) Collect an indemnity payment for the other 65 percent of insurable loss that was not previously paid under section 15(e)(2)(i); and</P>
              <P>(B) Be responsible for the remainder of the premium for the first insured crop that you did not pay under section 15(e)(2)(ii).</P>
              <P>(f) With respect to acreage where you were prevented from planting the first insured crop in the crop year, except in the case of double cropping described in section 15(h):</P>
              <P>(1) If a second crop is not planted on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year, you may collect a prevented planting payment that is equal to 100 percent of the prevented planting payment for the acreage for the first insured crop; or</P>

              <P>(2) If a second crop is planted on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year <PRTPAGE P="150"/>(you will pay the full premium and, if there is an insurable loss to the second crop, receive the full amount of indemnity that may be due for the second crop, regardless of whether there is a subsequent crop planted on the same acreage) and:</P>
              <P>(i) Provided the second crop is not planted on or before the final planting date or during the late planting period (as applicable) for the first insured crop, you may collect a prevented planting payment that is 35 percent of the prevented planting payment for the first insured crop; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Be responsible for premium that is 35 percent of the premium that you would otherwise owe for the first insured crop.</P>
              <P>(g) The reduction in the amount of indemnity or prevented planting payment and premium specified in sections 15(e) and 15(f), as applicable, will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding the priority contained in the Agreement to Insure section, which states that the Crop Provisions have priority over the Basic Provisions when a conflict exists, to any premium owed or indemnity or prevented planting payment made in accordance with the Crop Provisions, and any applicable endorsement.</P>
              <P>(2) Even if another person plants the second crop on any acreage where the first insured crop was planted or was prevented from being planted, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(3) For prevented planting only:</P>
              <P>(i) If a volunteer crop or cover crop is hayed or grazed from the same acreage, after the late planting period (or after the final planting date if a late planting period is not applicable) for the first insured crop in the same crop year, or is otherwise harvested anytime after the late planting period (or after the final planting date if a late planting period is not applicable); or</P>
              <P>(ii) If you receive cash rent for any acreage on which you were prevented from planting.</P>
              <P>(h) You may receive a full indemnity, or a full prevented planting payment for a first insured crop when a second crop is planted on the same acreage in the same crop year, if each of the following conditions are met, regardless of whether or not the second crop is insured or sustains an insurable loss:</P>
              <P>(1) Planting two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year in the area is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts;</P>
              <P>(2) The second or more crops are customarily planted after the first insured crop for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year in the area;</P>
              <P>(3) Additional coverage insurance offered under the authority of the Act is available in the county on the two or more crops that are double cropped;</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of prevented planting, the second crop is not planted on or prior to the final planting date or, if applicable, prior to the end of the late planting period for the first insured crop;</P>
              <P>(5) You provide records, acceptable to us, of acreage and production specific to the double cropped acreage proving that:</P>
              <P>(i) You have double cropped acreage in at least two of the last four crop years in which the first insured crop was planted and incur an insurable loss or the first insured crop is prevented from being planted and a second crop is planted. If you acquired additional land for the current crop year you may apply the percentage of acres that you have previously double cropped to the total cropland acres that you are farming this year (if greater) using the following calculation:</P>
              <P>(A) Determine the number of acres of the first insured crop that were double cropped in each of the years for which double cropping records are provided (For example, records are provided showing: 100 acres of wheat planted in 2016 and 50 of those acres were double cropped with soybeans; and 100 acres of wheat planted in 2017 and 70 of those acres were double cropped with soybeans);</P>
              <P>(B) Divide each result of section 15(h)(5)(i)(A) by the number of acres of the first insured crop that were planted in each respective year (In the example above, 50 divided by 100 equals 50 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2016 and 70 divided by 100 equals 70 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2017);</P>
              <P>(C) Add the results of section 15(h)(5)(i)(B) and divide by the number of years the first insured crop was double cropped (In the example above, 50 plus 70 equals 120 divided by 2 equals 60 percent); and</P>
              <P>(D) Multiply the result of 15(h)(5)(i)(C) by the number of insured acres of the first insured crop (In the example above, 60 percent multiplied by the number of wheat acres insured in 2018); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicable acreage was double cropped (by one or more other producers, and the producer(s) will allow you to use their records) for at least two of the last four crop years in which the first insured crop was grown on it; and</P>
              <P>(6) If you do not have records of acreage and production specific to the double cropped acreage, as required in section 15(h)(5), but instead have records that combine production from acreage you double cropped with records of production from acreage you did not double crop, we will allocate the first and second crop production to the specific acreage in proportion to the liability for the acreage that was and was not double cropped.</P>
              <P>(i) If you provided acceptable records in accordance with section 15(h), your double cropping history is based on the acres historically cropped:</P>

              <P>(1) If the records you provided are from acreage you double cropped in at least two of <PRTPAGE P="151"/>the last four crop years, you may apply your history of double cropping to any acreage of the insured crop in the county (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you have double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire an additional 100 acres in the county, you can apply that history of double cropped acreage to any of the 200 acres in the county as long as it does not exceed 100 acres); or</P>

              <P>(2) If the records you provided are from acreage that one or more other producers double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may only use the history of double cropping for the same physical acres from which double cropping records were provided (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if a neighbor has double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire your neighbor's 100 double cropped acres and an additional 100 acres in the county, you can only apply your neighbor's history of double cropped acreage to the same 100 acres that your neighbor double cropped).</P>
              <P>(j) If any Federal or State agency requires destruction of any insured crop or crop production, as applicable, because it contains levels of a substance, or has a condition, that is injurious to human or animal health in excess of the maximum amounts allowed by the Food and Drug Administration, other public health organizations of the United States or an agency of the applicable State, you must destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, and certify that such insured crop or crop production has been destroyed prior to receiving an indemnity payment. Failure to destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, will result in you having to repay any indemnity paid and you may be subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with section 515(h) of the Act and 7 CFR part 400, subpart R, and any applicable civil or criminal sanctions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">16. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>Unless limited by the Crop Provisions, insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(a) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre planted to the insured crop during the late planting period will be reduced by 1 percent per day for each day planted after the final planting date.</P>
              <P>(b) Acreage planted after the late planting period (or after the final planting date for crops that do not have a late planting period) may be insured as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre planted as specified in this subsection will be determined by multiplying the production guarantee or amount of insurance that is provided for acreage of the insured crop that is timely planted by the prevented planting coverage level percentage you elected, or that is contained in the Crop Provisions if you did not elect a prevented planting coverage level percentage;</P>
              <P>(2) Planting on such acreage must have been prevented by the final planting date (or during the late planting period, if applicable) by an insurable cause occurring within the insurance period for prevented planting coverage; and</P>
              <P>(3) All production from insured acreage as specified in this section will be included as production to count for the unit.</P>
              <P>(c) The premium amount for insurable acreage specified in this section will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for such acreage exceeds the liability, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid).</P>
              <P>(d) Any acreage on which an insured cause of loss is a material factor in preventing completion of planting, as specified in the definition of “planted acreage” (e.g., seed is broadcast on the soil surface but cannot be incorporated) will be considered as acreage planted after the final planting date and the production guarantee will be calculated in accordance with section 16(b)(1).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">17. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>(a) Unless limited by the policy provisions, a prevented planting payment may be made to you for eligible acreage if:</P>
              <P>(1) You are prevented from planting the insured crop on insurable acreage by an insured cause of loss that occurs:</P>
              <P>(i) On or after the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county for the crop year the application for insurance is accepted; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For any subsequent crop year, on or after the sales closing date for the previous crop year for the insured crop in the county, provided insurance has been in force continuously since that date. Cancellation for the purpose of transferring the policy to a different insurance provider for the subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuity for the purpose of the preceding sentence;</P>
              <P>(2) You include on your acreage report any insurable acreage of the insured crop that was prevented from being planted; and</P>
              <P>(3) You did not plant the insured crop during or after the late planting period. Acreage planted to the insured crop during or after the late planting period is covered under the late planting provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) The actuarial documents may contain additional levels of prevented planting coverage that you may purchase for the insured crop:</P>

              <P>(1) Such purchase must be made on or before the sales closing date.<PRTPAGE P="152"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If you do not purchase one of those additional levels by the sales closing date, you will receive the prevented planting coverage specified in the Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) If you have a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for any crop, the additional levels of prevented planting coverage will not be available for that crop.</P>
              <P>(4) You cannot increase your elected or assigned prevented planting coverage level for any crop year if a cause of loss that could prevent planting (even though it is not known whether such cause will actually prevent planting) has occurred during the prevented planting insurance period specified in section 17(a)(1)(i) or (ii) and prior to your request to change your prevented planting coverage level.</P>
              <P>(c) The premium amount for acreage that is prevented from being planted will be the same as that for timely planted acreage except as specified in section 15(f). If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less the subsidy) for acreage that is prevented from being planted exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).</P>
              <P>(d) Prevented planting coverage will be provided against:</P>
              <P>(1) Drought, failure of the irrigation water supply, failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities, or the inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method, due to an insured cause of loss only if, on the final planting date (or within the late planting period if you elect to try to plant the crop), you provide documentation acceptable to us to establish:</P>
              <P>(i) For non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed or progress toward crop maturity due to a prolonged period of dry weather. The documentation for prolonged period of dry weather must be verifiable using information collected by sources whose business it is to record and study the weather, including, but not limited to, local weather reporting stations of the National Weather Service; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For irrigated acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) Due to an insured cause of loss, there is not a reasonable expectation of having adequate water to carry out an irrigated practice or you are unable to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If you knew or had reason to know on the final planting date or during the late planting period that your water will be reduced, no reasonable expectation exists; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Available water resources will be verified using information from State Departments of Water Resources, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Natural Resources Conservation Service or other sources whose business includes collection of water data or regulation of water resources; or</P>
              <P>(B) The irrigation equipment or facilities have failed or broken down if such failure or breakdown is due to an insured cause of loss specified in section 12(d).</P>
              <P>(2) Causes other than drought, failure of the irrigation water supply, failure or breakdown of the irrigation equipment or facilities, or your inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method, provided the cause of loss is specified in the Crop Provisions. However, if it is possible for you to plant on or prior to the final planting date when other producers in the area are planting and you fail to plant, no prevented planting payment will be made.</P>
              <P>(e) The maximum number of acres that may be eligible for a prevented planting payment for any crop will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The total number of acres eligible for prevented planting coverage for all crops cannot exceed the number of acres of cropland in your farming operation for the crop year, unless you are eligible for prevented planting coverage on double cropped acreage in accordance with section 17(f)(4). The eligible acres for each insured crop will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If you have planted any crop in the county for which prevented planting insurance was available (you will be considered to have planted if your APH database contains actual planted acres) or have received a prevented planting insurance guarantee in any one or more of the four most recent crop years, and the insured crop is not required to be contracted with a processor to be insured:</P>
              <P>(A) The number of eligible acres will be the maximum number of acres certified for APH purposes, or insured acres reported, for the crop in any one of the four most recent crop years (not including reported prevented planting acreage that was planted to a second crop unless you meet the double cropping requirements in section 17(f)(4)).</P>
              <P>(B) If you acquire additional land for the current crop year, the number of eligible acres determined in section 17(e)(1)(i)(A) for a crop may be increased by multiplying it by the ratio of the total cropland acres that you are farming this year (if greater) to the total cropland acres that you farmed in the previous year, provided that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You submit proof to us that you acquired additional acreage for the current crop year by any of the methods specified in section 17(f)(12);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The additional acreage was acquired in time to plant it for the current crop year using good farming practices; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) No cause of loss has occurred at the time you acquire the acreage that may prevent planting (except acreage you lease the <PRTPAGE P="153"/>previous year and continue to lease in the current crop year).</P>

              <P>(C) If you add adequate irrigation facilities to your existing non-irrigated acreage or if you acquire additional land for the current crop year that has adequate irrigation facilities, the number of eligible acres determined in section 17(e)(1)(i)(A) for irrigated acreage of a crop may be increased by multiplying it by the ratio of the total irrigated acres that you are farming this year (if greater) to the total irrigated acres that you farmed in the previous year, provided the conditions in sections 17(e)(1)(i)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>), (<E T="03">2</E>) and (<E T="03">3</E>) are met. If there were no irrigated acres in the previous year, the eligible irrigated acres for a crop will be limited to the lesser of the number of eligible non-irrigated acres of the crop or the number of acres on which adequate irrigation facilities were added.</P>
              <P>(ii) If you have not planted any crop in the county for which prevented planting insurance was available (you will be considered to have planted if your APH database contains actual planted acres) or have not received a prevented planting insurance guarantee in all of the four most recent crop years, and the insured crop is not required to be contracted with a processor to be insured:</P>
              <P>(A) The number of eligible acres will be:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The number of acres specified on your intended acreage report, which must be submitted to us by the sales closing date for all crops you insure for the crop year and that is accepted by us; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The number of acres specified on your intended acreage report, which must be submitted to us within 10 days of the time you acquire the acreage and that is accepted by us, if, on the sales closing date, you do not have any acreage in a county and you subsequently acquire acreage through a method described in section 17(f)(12) in time to plant it using good farming practices.</P>
              <P>(B) The total number of acres listed on the intended acreage report may not exceed the number of acres of cropland in your farming operation at the time you submit the intended acreage report.</P>
              <P>(C) If you acquire additional acreage after we accept your intended acreage report, the number of acres determined in section 17(e)(1)(ii)(A) may be increased in accordance with section 17(e)(1)(i)(B) and (C).</P>
              <P>(D) Prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage included on the intended acreage report or any increased amount of acreage determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1)(ii)(C) if a cause of loss that may prevent planting occurred before the acreage was acquired, as determined by us.</P>
              <P>(iii) For any crop that must be contracted with a processor to be insured:</P>
              <P>(A) The number of eligible acres will be:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The number of acres of the crop specified in the processor contract, if the contract specifies a number of acres contracted for the crop year;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The result of dividing the quantity of production stated in the processor contract by your approved yield, if the processor contract specifies a quantity of production that will be accepted (for the purposes of establishing the number of prevented planting acres, any reductions applied to the transitional yield for failure to certify acreage and production for four prior years will not be used); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Notwithstanding sections 17(e)(1)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>), if a minimum number of acres or amount of production is specified in the processor contract, this amount will be used to determine the eligible acres.</P>
              <P>(B) If a processor cancels or does not provide contracts, or reduces the contracted acreage or production from what would have otherwise been allowed, solely because the acreage was prevented from being planted due to an insured cause of loss, we will determine the number of eligible acres based on the number of acres or amount of production you had contracted in the county in the previous crop year. If the applicable Crop Provisions require that the price election be based on a contract price, and a contract is not in force for the current year, the price election will be based on the contract price in place for the previous crop year. If you did not have a processor contract in place for the previous crop year, you will not have any eligible prevented planting acreage for the applicable processor crop. The total eligible prevented planting acres in all counties cannot exceed the total number of acres or amount of production contracted in all counties in the previous crop year.</P>
              <P>(2) Any eligible acreage determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1) will be reduced by subtracting the number of acres of the crop (insured and uninsured) that are timely and late planted, including acreage specified in section 16(b).</P>
              <P>(f) Regardless of the number of eligible acres determined in section 17(e), prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage:</P>
              <P>(1) That does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the insurable crop acreage in the unit, whichever is less (If the crop is in a whole-farm unit, the 20 acre or 20 percent requirement will be applied separately to each crop in the whole-farm unit). Any prevented planting acreage within a field that contains planted acreage will be considered to be acreage of the same crop, type, and practice that is planted in the field unless:</P>

              <P>(i) The acreage that was prevented from being planted constitutes at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the total insurable acreage in the field and you produced both crops, crop types, or followed both practices in the same <PRTPAGE P="154"/>field in the same crop year within any one of the four most recent crop years;</P>
              <P>(ii) You were prevented from planting a first insured crop and you planted a second crop in the field (There can only be one first insured crop in a field unless the requirements in section 17(f)(1)(i) or (iii) are met); or</P>

              <P>(iii) The insured crop planted in the field would not have been planted on the remaining prevented planting acreage (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> where rotation requirements would not be met or you already planted the total number of acres specified in the processor contact);</P>
              <P>(2) For which the actuarial documents do not provide the information needed to determine the premium rate, unless a written agreement designates such premium rate;</P>
              <P>(3) Used for conservation purposes, intended to be left unplanted under any program administered by the USDA or other government agency, or required to be left unharvested under the terms of the lease or any other agreement (The number of acres eligible for prevented planting will be limited to the number of acres specified in the lease for which you are required to pay either cash or share rent);</P>
              <P>(4) On which the insured crop is prevented from being planted, if you or any other person receives a prevented planting payment for any crop for the same acreage in the same crop year, excluding share arrangements, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) It is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts in the area to plant the insured crop for harvest following harvest of the first insured crop, and additional coverage insurance offered under the authority of the Act is available in the county for both crops in the same crop year;</P>
              <P>(ii) For the insured crop that is prevented from being planted, you provide records acceptable to us of acreage and production that show, in at least two of the last four crop years:</P>

              <P>(A) You have double cropped acreage on which the insured crop that is prevented from being planted in the current crop year was grown (You may apply your history of double cropping to any acreage of the insured crop in the county (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you have double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire an additional 100 acres in the county, you can apply that history of double cropped acreage to any of the 200 acres in the county as long as it does not exceed 100 acres)); or</P>

              <P>(B) The acreage you are prevented from planting in the current crop year was double cropped with the insured crop that is prevented from being planted (You may only use the history of double cropping for the same physical acres from which double cropping records were provided (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if a neighbor has double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire your neighbor's 100 double cropped acres and an additional 100 acres in the county, you can only apply your neighbor's history of double cropped acreage to the same 100 acres that your neighbor double cropped)); and</P>
              <P>(iii) The amount of acreage you are double cropping in the current crop year does not exceed the number of acres for which you provided the records required in section 17(f)(4)(ii);</P>
              <P>(5) On which the insured crop is prevented from being planted, if:</P>
              <P>(i) Any crop is planted within or prior to the late planting period or on or prior to the final planting date if no late planting period is applicable, unless:</P>
              <P>(A) You meet the double cropping requirements in section 17(f)(4);</P>
              <P>(B) The crop planted was a cover crop; or</P>
              <P>(C) No benefit, including any benefit under any USDA program, was derived from the crop; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Any volunteer or cover crop is hayed, grazed or otherwise harvested within or prior to the late planting period or on or prior to the final planting date if no late planting period is applicable;</P>
              <P>(6) For which planting history or conservation plans indicate the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation purposes or on which any pasture or forage crop is in place on the acreage during the time planting of the insured crop generally occurs in the area. Cover plants that are seeded, transplanted, or that volunteer:</P>

              <P>(i) More than 12 months prior to the final planting date for the insured crop that was prevented from being planted will be considered pasture or a forage crop that is in place (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the cover crop is planted 15 months prior to the final planting date and remains in place during the time the insured crop would normally be planted); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Less than 12 months prior to the final planting date for the insured crop that was prevented from being planted will not be considered pasture or a forage crop that is in place;</P>
              <P>(7) That exceeds the number of acres eligible for a prevented planting payment;</P>
              <P>(8) That exceeds the number of eligible acres physically available for planting;</P>
              <P>(9) For which you cannot provide proof that you had the inputs (including, but not limited to, sufficient equipment and labor) available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of producing at least the yield used to determine your production guarantee or amount of insurance. Evidence that you previously had planted the crop on the unit will be considered adequate proof unless:</P>

              <P>(i) There has been a change in the availability of inputs since the crop was last planted that could affect your ability to plant and produce the insured crop;<PRTPAGE P="155"/>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) We determine you have insufficient inputs to plant the total number of insured crop acres (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> you will not receive a prevented planting payment if you have sufficient inputs to plant only 80 acres but you have already planted 80 acres and are claiming prevented planting on an additional 100 acres); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Your planting practices or rotational requirements show the acreage would have remained fallow or been planted to another crop;</P>
              <P>(10) Based on an irrigated practice production guarantee or amount of insurance unless adequate irrigation facilities were in place to carry out an irrigated practice on the acreage prior to the insured cause of loss that prevented you from planting. Acreage with an irrigated practice production guarantee will be limited to the number of acres allowed for that practice under sections 17(e) and (f);</P>
              <P>(11) Based on a crop type that you did not plant, or did not receive a prevented planting insurance guarantee for, in at least one of the four most recent crop years:</P>
              <P>(i) Types for which separate projected prices or price elections, as applicable, amounts of insurance, or production guarantees are available must be included in your APH database in at least one of the four most recent crop years (Crops for which the insurance guarantee is not based on APH must be reported on your acreage report in at least one of the four most recent crop years) except as allowed in section 17(e)(1)(ii) or (iii); and</P>
              <P>(ii) We will limit prevented planting payments based on a specific crop type to the number of acres allowed for that crop type as specified in sections 17(e) and (f); or</P>
              <P>(12) If a cause of loss has occurred that may prevent planting at the time:</P>
              <P>(i) You lease the acreage (except acreage you leased the previous crop year and continue to lease in the current crop year);</P>
              <P>(ii) You buy the acreage;</P>
              <P>(iii) The acreage is released from a USDA program which prohibits harvest of a crop;</P>
              <P>(iv) You request a written agreement to insure the acreage; or</P>
              <P>(v) You acquire the acreage through means other than lease or purchase (such as inherited or gifted acreage).</P>
              <P>(g) If you purchased an additional coverage policy for a crop, and you executed a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option that separately insures acreage which has been designated as “high-risk” land by FCIC under a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for that crop, the maximum number of acres eligible for a prevented planting payment will be limited for each policy as specified in sections 17(e) and (f).</P>
              <P>(h) If you are prevented from planting a crop for which you do not have an adequate base of eligible prevented planting acreage, as determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1), we will use acreage from another crop insured for the current crop year for which you have remaining eligible prevented planting acreage.</P>
              <P>(1) The crop first used for this purpose will be the insured crop that would have a prevented planting payment most similar to the payment for the crop that was prevented from being planted.</P>
              <P>(i) If there are still insufficient eligible prevented planting acres, the next crop used will be the insured crop that would have the next closest prevented planting payment.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the event payment amounts based on other crops are an equal amount above and below the payment amount for the crop that was prevented from being planted, eligible acres for the crop with the higher payment amount will be used first.</P>
              <P>(2) The prevented planting payment and premium will be based on:</P>
              <P>(i) The crop that was prevented from being planted if the insured crop with remaining eligible acreage would have resulted in a higher prevented planting payment than would have been paid for the crop that was prevented from being planted; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The crop from which eligible acres are being used if the insured crop with remaining eligible acreage will result in a lower prevented planting payment than would have been paid for the crop that was prevented from being planted.</P>
              <P>(3) For example, assume you were prevented from planting 200 acres of corn and you have 100 acres eligible for a corn prevented planting guarantee that would result in a payment of $40 per acre. You also had 50 acres of potato eligibility that would result in a $100 per acre payment and 90 acres of grain sorghum eligibility that would result in a $30 per acre payment. Your prevented planting coverage will be based on 100 acres of corn ($40 per acre), 90 acres of grain sorghum ($30 per acre), and an additional 10 acres of corn (using potato eligible acres and paid as corn at $40 per acre). Your prevented planting payment would be $7,100 ($4,000 + $2,700 + $400).</P>
              <P>(4) Prevented planting coverage will be allowed as specified in section 17(h) only if the crop that was prevented from being planted meets all the policy provisions, except for having an adequate base of eligible prevented planting acreage. Payment may be made based on crops other than those that were prevented from being planted even though other policy provisions, including but not limited to, processor contract and rotation requirements, have not been met for the crop whose eligible acres are being used.</P>

              <P>(5) An additional administrative fee will not be due as a result of using eligible prevented planting acreage as specified in section 17(h).<PRTPAGE P="156"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The prevented planting payment for any eligible acreage within a unit will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the prevented planting coverage level percentage you elected, or that is contained in the Crop Provisions if you did not elect a prevented planting coverage level percentage, by:</P>
              <P>(i) Your amount of insurance per acre; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount determined by multiplying the production guarantee (per acre) for timely planted acreage of the insured crop (or type, if applicable) by your price election or your projected price, whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result of section 17(i)(1) by the number of eligible prevented planting acres in the unit; and</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the result of section 17(i)(2) by your share.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">18. Written Agreements</HD>
              <P>Terms of this policy which are specifically designated for the use of written agreements may be altered by written agreement in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(a) You must apply in writing for each written agreement (including renewal of a written agreement) no later than the sales closing date, except as provided in section 18(e);</P>
              <P>(b) The application for a written agreement must contain all variable terms of the contract between you and us that will be in effect if the written agreement is not approved;</P>
              <P>(c) If approved by FCIC, the written agreement will include all variable terms of the contract, including, but not limited to, the crop; practice, type or variety; guarantee; premium rate; and projected price, harvest price, price election or amount of insurance, as applicable, or the information needed to determine such variable terms. If the written agreement is for a county:</P>
              <P>(1) That has a price election or amount of insurance stated in the actuarial documents, for the crop, practice, type or variety, the written agreement will contain the price election or amount of insurance stated in the actuarial documents, for the crop, practice, type or variety;</P>
              <P>(2) That does not have price elections or amounts of insurance stated in the actuarial documents, for the crop, practice, type or variety, the written agreement will contain a price election or amount of insurance that does not exceed the price election or amount of insurance contained in the actuarial documents, for the county that is used to establish the other terms of the written agreement, unless otherwise authorized by the Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(3) For which revenue protection is not available for the crop, but revenue protection is available in the State for the crop, the written agreement will contain the information used to establish the projected price and harvest price, as applicable, for that State; or</P>
              <P>(4) In a State for which revenue protection is not available for the crop, but revenue protection is available for the crop in another State, the written agreement is available for yield protection only, and will contain the information needed to determine the projected price for the crop from another State as determined by FCIC;</P>
              <P>(d) Each written agreement will only be valid for the number of crop years specified in the written agreement, and a multi-year written agreement:</P>
              <P>(1) Will only apply for any particular crop year designated in the written agreement if all terms and conditions in the written agreement are still applicable for the crop year and the conditions under which the written agreement has been provided have not changed prior to the beginning of the insurance period (If conditions change during or prior to the crop year, the written agreement will not be effective for that crop year but may still be effective for a subsequent crop year if conditions under which the written agreement has been provided exist for such year);</P>
              <P>(2) May be canceled in writing by:</P>
              <P>(i) FCIC not less than 30 days before the cancellation date if it discovers that any term or condition of the written agreement, including the premium rate, is not appropriate for the crop; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You or us on or before the cancellation date;</P>
              <P>(3) That is not renewed in writing after it expires, is not applicable for a crop year, or is canceled, then insurance coverage will be in accordance with the terms and conditions stated in this policy, without regard to the written agreement; and</P>
              <P>(4) Will be automatically canceled if you transfer your policy to another insurance provider (No notice will be provided to you and for any subsequent crop year, for a written agreement to be effective, you must timely request renewal of the written agreement in accordance with this section);</P>
              <P>(e) A request for a written agreement may be submitted:</P>

              <P>(1) After the sales closing date, but on or before the acreage reporting date, if you demonstrate your physical inability to submit the request on or before the sales closing date (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> you have been hospitalized or a blizzard has made it impossible to submit the written agreement request in person or by mail); or</P>
              <P>(2) For the first year the written agreement is requested:</P>
              <P>(i) On or before the acreage reporting date to:</P>

              <P>(A) Insure unrated land, or an unrated practice, type or variety of a crop; although, if required by FCIC, such written agreements <PRTPAGE P="157"/>may be approved only after appraisal of the acreage by us and:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The crop's potential is equal to or exceeds 90 percent of the yield used to determine your production guarantee or amount of insurance; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You sign the written agreement no later than the date the first field is appraised or by the expiration date for you to accept the offer, whichever comes first; or</P>
              <P>(B) Establish optional units in accordance with FCIC procedures that otherwise would not be allowed or change the premium rate or transitional yield for designated high-risk land;</P>
              <P>(ii) On or before the cancellation date to insure a crop in a county that does not have actuarial documents for the crop (If the Crop Provisions do not provide a cancellation date for the county, the cancellation date for other insurable crops in the same State that have similar final planting and harvesting dates will be applicable); or</P>
              <P>(iii) On or before the date specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions;</P>
              <P>(f) A request for a written agreement must contain:</P>
              <P>(1) For all written agreement requests:</P>
              <P>(i) A completed “Request for Actuarial Change” form;</P>
              <P>(ii) A completed APH (only for crop policies that require APH) based on verifiable records of actual yields for the crop and county for which the written agreement is being requested (the actual yields do not necessarily have to be from the same physical acreage for which you are requesting a written agreement), and verifiable records of actual yields if required by FCIC;</P>
              <P>(iii) Evidence from agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts, as applicable, that the crop can be produced in the area if the request is to provide insurance for the crop practices, types, or varieties that are not insurable, unless we are notified in writing by FCIC that such evidence is not required by FCIC;</P>
              <P>(iv) The legal description of the land (in areas where legal descriptions are available) and the FSA farm number including tract and field numbers, if available. The submission must also include an FSA aerial photograph, or field boundaries derived by a Geographic Information System or Global Positioning System, or other legible maps delineating field boundaries where you intend to plant the crop for which insurance is requested; and</P>
              <P>(v) For any perennial crop, an inspection report completed by us;</P>
              <P>(2) For written agreement requests for counties without actuarial documents for the crop, the requirements in section 18(f)(1) (except section 18(f)(1)(ii)) and:</P>
              <P>(i) For a crop you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have previously planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) in the county or area for at least three years:</P>
              <P>(A) A completed APH (only for crop policies that require APH) based on verifiable production records of actual yields for the crop; and</P>
              <P>(B) Verifiable production records for at least the three most recent crop years in which the crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop):</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The verifiable production records do not necessarily have to be from the same physical acreage for which you are requesting a written agreement;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Verifiable production records do not have to be submitted for any year you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have insured the crop in the county or area and have certified the yields on the applicable production reports or the yields are based on your insurance claim (although you are not required to submit production records, you still must maintain production records in accordance with section 21); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) FCIC will not consider any crop year in which the crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) outside of the most recent ten crop years as a year of previously planting the crop (or having produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop), unless verifiable production records are provided, or the crop was insured for that crop year;</P>
              <P>(ii) For a crop you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have not previously planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) in the county or area for at least three years:</P>
              <P>(A) A completed APH (only for crop policies that require APH) based on verifiable production records of actual yields for the similar crop;</P>
              <P>(B) Verifiable production records for at least the three most recent crop years in which the similar crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) in the county or area:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The verifiable production records for the similar crop do not necessarily have to be from the same physical acreage for which you are requesting a written agreement;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Verifiable production records do not have to be submitted for any crop year you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have insured the similar crop in the county or area and have certified the yields on the applicable production reports or the yields are based on your insurance claim (although you are not required to submit production records, you still must maintain production records in accordance with section 21); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) FCIC will not consider any crop year in which the similar crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) outside of the most recent ten crop years as a year of previously planting the similar <PRTPAGE P="158"/>crop (or having produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop), unless verifiable production records are provided, or the similar crop was insured, for that crop year;</P>
              <P>(C) If you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have at least one year of production records, but less than three years of production records, for the crop in the county or area but have production records for a similar crop in the county or area such that the combination of both sets of records results in at least three years of production records, you must provide the information required in sections 18(f)(2)(i)(A) and (B) for the years you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) planted the crop (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) in the county or area and the information required in sections 18(f)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) regarding the similar crop for the remaining years; and</P>
              <P>(D) A similar crop to the crop for which a written agreement is being requested must:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Be included in the same category of crops, e.g., row crops (including, but not limited to, small grains, coarse grains, and oil seed crops), vegetable crops grown in rows, tree crops, vine crops, bush crops, etc., as defined by FCIC;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Have substantially the same growing season (i.e., normally planted around the same dates and harvested around the same dates);</P>

              <P>(1) All disputes involving determinations made by us, except those specified in section 20(d) or (e), are subject to mediation or arbitration.

              <P>(h) Except as provided in section 20(i), no award or settlement in mediation, arbitration, appeal, administrative review or reconsideration process or judicial review can exceed the amount of liability established or which should have been established under the policy, except for interest awarded in accordance with section 26.</P>
              <P>(i) In a judicial review only, you may recover attorneys fees or other expenses, or any punitive, compensatory or any other damages from us only if you obtain a determination from FCIC that we, our agent or loss adjuster failed to comply with the terms of this policy or procedures issued by FCIC and such failure resulted in you receiving a payment in an amount that is less than the amount to which you were entitled. Requests for such a determination should be addressed to the following: USDA/RMA/Deputy Administrator of Compliance/Stop 0806, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-0806.</P>

If you cannot demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect, you may be subject to the consequences authorized under this policy, the Act, or any other applicable statute. If you can demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect (For example, an application to transfer your policy or written notification to an insurance provider that states you want to purchase, or transfer, insurance and you want any other policies for the crop canceled would demonstrate you did not intend to have duplicate policies), and:</P>

              <P>(1) The amount of indemnity determined pursuant to this policy without regard to such other insurance; or</P>

              <P>(c) For the purpose of section 22(b), the amount of loss from fire will be the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the fire and the total value of the insured crop after the fire.

              <P>Although your violation of a number of federal statutes, including the Act, may cause cancellation, termination, or voidance of your insurance contract, you should be specifically aware that your policy will be canceled if you are determined to be ineligible to receive benefits under the Act due to violation of the controlled substance provisions (title XVII) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and the regulations promulgated under the Act by USDA. Your insurance policy will be canceled if you are determined, by the appropriate Agency, to be in violation of these provisions. We will recover any and all monies paid to you or received by you during your period of ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less an amount for expenses and handling equal to 20 percent of the premium paid or to be paid by you.</P>

              <P>(v) If we discover you do not qualify for a whole-farm unit for at least one insured crop because, even though you elected revenue protection for all your crops:</P>
              <P>(A) You do not meet all of the other requirements in section 34(a)(5)(i), and such discovery is made:</P>

              <P>(b) Unless limited by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, a basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit, you meet the following:</P>
              <P>(1) You must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit;</P>
              <P>(2) All optional units you select for the crop year are identified on the acreage report for that crop year (Units will be determined when the acreage is reported but may be adjusted or combined to reflect the actual unit structure when adjusting a loss. No further unit division may be made after the acreage reporting date for any reason);</P>
              <P>(3) You have records, that are acceptable to us, for at least the previous crop year for all optional units that you will report in the current crop year (You may be required to produce the records for all optional units for the previous crop year); and</P>

              <P>(4) You have records of marketed or stored production from each optional unit maintained in such a manner that permits us to verify the production from each optional unit, or the production from each optional unit is kept separate until loss adjustment is completed by us.<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following, unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or allowed by written agreement:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate section where the boundaries are readily discernible:</P>
              <P>(i) In the absence of sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure, such as Spanish grants, provided the boundaries are readily discernible, if such parcels can be considered as the equivalent of sections for unit purposes in accordance with FCIC issued procedures; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the absence of sections as described in section 34(c)(1) or other methods of measure used to establish section equivalents as described in section 34(c)(1)(i), optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate FSA farm number in accordance with FCIC issued procedure;</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm number, optional units may be based on irrigated and non-irrigated acreage. To qualify as separate irrigated and non-irrigated optional units, the non-irrigated acreage may not continue into the irrigated acreage in the same rows or planting pattern. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which the irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed to produce the yield on which the guarantee is based, except the corners of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used may be considered as irrigated acreage if the corners of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used do not qualify as a separate non-irrigated optional unit. In this case, production from both practices will be used to determine your approved yield; and</P>
              <P>(3) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm number, or irrigated and non-irrigated acreage, separate optional units may be established for acreage of the insured crop grown and insured under an organic farming practice. Certified organic, transitional and buffer zone acreages do not individually qualify as separate units. (See section 37 for additional provisions regarding acreage insured under an organic farming practice).</P>
              <P>(d) Optional units are not available for crops insured under a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.</P>
              <P>(e) If you do not comply fully with the provisions in this section, we will combine all optional units that are not in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed. We will combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these provisions. If failure to comply with these provisions is determined by us to be inadvertent, and the optional units are combined into a basic unit, that portion of the additional premium paid for the optional units that have been combined will be refunded to you for the units combined.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">35. Multiple Benefits</HD>
              <P>(a) If you are eligible to receive an indemnity and are also eligible to receive benefits for the same loss under any other USDA program, you may receive benefits under both programs, unless specifically limited by the crop insurance contract or by law.</P>
              <P>(b) Any amount received for the same loss from any USDA program, in addition to the crop insurance payment, will not exceed the difference between the crop insurance payment and the actual amount of the loss, unless otherwise provided by law. The amount of the actual loss is the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the loss and the total value of the insured crop after the loss.</P>
              <P>(1) For crops for which revenue protection is not available:</P>
              <P>(i) If you have an approved yield, the total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the highest price election for the crop; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If you have an approved yield, the total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the highest price election for the crop; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If you have an amount of insurance, the total value of the crop before the loss is the highest amount of insurance available for the crop; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If you have an amount of insurance, the total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the price contained in the Crop Provisions for valuing production to count.</P>
              <P>(2) For crops for which revenue protection is available and:</P>
              <P>(i) You elect yield protection:</P>
              <P>(A) The total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the applicable projected price (at the 100 percent price level) for the crop; and</P>
              <P>(B) The total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the applicable projected price (at the 100 percent price level) for the crop; or</P>
              <P>(ii) You elect revenue protection:</P>
              <P>(A) The total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the higher of the applicable projected price or harvest price for the crop (If you have elected the harvest price exclusion, the applicable projected price for the crop will be used); and</P>
              <P>(B) The total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the harvest price for the crop.</P>

              <P>(c) FSA or another USDA agency, as applicable, will determine and pay the additional amount due you for any applicable USDA <PRTPAGE P="169"/>program, after first considering the amount of any crop insurance indemnity.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">36. Changes to Yields</HD>
              <P>(a) When you have actual yields in your production history database that, due to an insurable cause of loss, are less than 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield you may elect, on an individual actual yield basis, to exclude and replace one or more of any such yields within each database.</P>
              <P>(1) Each election made in section 36(a) must be made on or before the production reporting date for the insured crop and each such election will remain in effect for succeeding years unless canceled by the production reporting date for the succeeding crop year. If you cancel an election, the actual yield will be used in the database. For example, if you elected to substitute yields in your database for the 1998 and 2000 crop year, for any subsequent crop year, you can elect to cancel the substitution for either or both years.</P>
              <P>(2) Each excluded actual yield will be replaced with a yield equal to 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year in which the yield is being replaced, unless you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, in which case the excluded actual yield will be replaced with a yield equal to 80 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year in which the yield is being replaced. (For example, if you elect to exclude a 2001 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2001 crop year in the county will be used. If you also elect to exclude a 2002 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2002 crop year in the county will be used). The replacement yields will be used in the same manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved yield.</P>
              <P>(3) Once you have elected to exclude an actual yield from the database, the replacement yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the database unless this election is canceled in accordance with section 36(b).</P>
              <P>(4) Although your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed, the premium rate will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the substitution of higher yields.</P>
              <P>(b) If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect to exclude any actual yield for any crop year when FCIC determines for a county, or its contiguous counties, the per planted acre yield was at least 50 percent below the simple average of the per planted acre yield for the crop in the county for the previous 10 consecutive crop years.</P>
              <P>(c) If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect to limit a reduction to the approved APH yield to a maximum decline of 10 percent of the previous crop year's approved APH yield when such reduction is due to a decline in production resulting from a natural disaster or other insurable loss, as provided in FCIC procedures.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">37. Organic Farming Practices.</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8(b)(2), insurance will not be provided for any crop grown using an organic farming practice, unless the information needed to determine a premium rate for an organic farming practice is specified on the actuarial table, or insurance is allowed by a written agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) If insurance is provided for an organic farming practice as specified in section 37(a), only the following acreage will be insured under such practice:</P>
              <P>(1) Certified organic acreage;</P>
              <P>(2) Transitional acreage being converted to certified organic acreage in accordance with an organic plan; and</P>
              <P>(3) Buffer zone acreage.</P>
              <P>(c) On the date you report your acreage, you must have:</P>
              <P>(1) For certified organic acreage, a written certification in effect from a certifying agent indicating the name of the entity certified, effective date of certification, certificate number, types of commodities certified, and name and address of the certifying agent (A certificate issued to a tenant may be used to qualify a landlord or other similar arrangement);</P>
              <P>(2) For transitional acreage, a certificate as described in section 37(c)(1), or written documentation from a certifying agent indicating an organic plan is in effect for the acreage; and</P>
              <P>(3) Records from the certifying agent showing the specific location of each field of certified organic, transitional, buffer zone, and acreage not maintained under organic management.</P>
              <P>(d) If you claim a loss on any acreage insured under an organic farming practice, you must provide us with copies of the records required in section 37(c).</P>
              <P>(e) If any acreage qualifies as certified organic or transitional acreage on the date you report such acreage, and such certification is subsequently revoked by the certifying agent, or the certifying agent no longer considers the acreage as transitional acreage for the remainder of the crop year, that acreage will remain insured under the reported practice for which it qualified at the time the acreage was reported. Any loss due to failure to comply with organic standards will be considered an uninsured cause of loss.</P>
              <P>(f) Contamination by application or drift of prohibited substances onto land on which crops are grown using organic farming practices will not be an insured peril on any certified organic, transitional or buffer zone acreage.</P>

              <P>(g) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17(f), prevented planting coverage <PRTPAGE P="170"/>will not be provided for any acreage based on an organic farming practice in excess of the number of acres that will be grown under an organic farming practice and shown as such in the records required in section 37(c).</P>
              <P>(h) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 17(f)(1) that specify prevented planting acreage within a field that contains planted acreage will be considered to be acreage of the same practice that is planted in the field, prevented planting acreage will be considered as organic practice acreage if it is identified as certified organic, transitional, or buffer zone acreage in the organic plan.</P>

              <P>(a) The crop insured will be each small grain you elect to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That is planted for harvest as grain (a grain mixture in which barley or oats is the predominate grain may also be insured if allowed by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if a written agreement allows insurance for such mixture. The production from such mixture will be considered as the predominate grain on a weight basis); and</P>
              <P>(3) That is not, unless insurance is allowed by a written agreement:</P>
              <P>(i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in section 6(a)(2);</P>
              <P>(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate and intended for harvest as grain.</P>
              <P>(b) Buckwheat will be insured only if it is produced under a contract with a business enterprise equipped with facilities appropriate to handle and store buckwheat production. The contract must be executed by you and the business enterprise, in effect for the crop year, and a copy provided to us no later than the acreage reporting date. To be considered a contract, the executed document must contain:</P>
              <P>(1) A requirement that you plant, grow and deliver buckwheat to the business enterprise;</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of production that will be accepted or a statement that all production from a specified number of acres will be accepted;</P>
              <P>(3) The price to be paid for the contracted production or a method to determine such price; and</P>
              <P>(4) Other such terms that establish the obligations of each party to the contract.</P>
              <P>(c) If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you:</P>
              <P>(1) May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed as uninsurable acreage (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached on the specified acreage and no premium will be due for such acreage. If you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions); or</P>
              <P>(2) May report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage for the crop year. Premium will be due on all the acreage except as set forth herein. If the Special Provisions allow a reduced premium amount for acreage intentionally destroyed prior to harvest, you may qualify for such reduction only if you notify us in writing on or before the date designated in the Special Provisions of the intended destruction, and do not claim an indemnity on the acreage. No premium reduction will be allowed if the required notice is not given or if you claim an indemnity for the acreage. Upon receiving timely notice, insurance coverage on the acreage you do not intend to harvest will cease and we will revise your acreage report to indicate the applicable reduction in premium. If you do not destroy the crop as intended, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <P>(d) In counties for which the actuarial table provides premium rates for the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (7 CFR 457.102), coverage is available for wheat or barley damaged between the time coverage begins and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the endorsement is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the endorsement and you execute the endorsement by the sales closing date.</P>
              <P>(e) In counties for which the actuarial table provides premium rates for malting barley coverage, an endorsement is available (7 CFR 457.118) that provides additional insurance protection for malting barley. This endorsement provides coverage for producers who grow malting barley under contract and for those who do not have a contract. Coverage under the endorsement is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the endorsement and you execute the endorsement by the sales closing date.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, and subject to any provisions provided by the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (if elected by you):</P>
              <P>(a) Insurance attaches on each unit or part thereof on the later of the date we accept your application or the date the insured crop is planted.</P>
              <P>(1) For oats, rye, flax and buckwheat, the following limitations apply:</P>

              <P>(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.<PRTPAGE P="174"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that producers in the surrounding area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(2) For barley and wheat, the following limitations apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the type (winter or spring) except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a fall final planting date, any acreage of winter barley or wheat damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.</P>
              <P>(iii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates:</P>
              <P>(A) Any winter barley or winter wheat that is damaged before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop to maintain insurance based on the winter type unless we agree that replanting is not practical. If it is not practical to replant to the winter type of wheat or barley but is practical to replant to a spring type, you must replant to a spring type to keep your insurance based on the winter type in force.</P>
              <P>(B) Any winter barley or winter wheat acreage that is replanted to a spring type of the same crop when it was practical to replant the winter type will be insured as the spring type and the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price applicable to the spring type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be considered to be initially planted to the spring type.</P>
              <P>(C) Notwithstanding sections 7(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), if you have elected coverage under a barley or wheat winter coverage endorsement (if available in the county), insurance will be in accordance with the endorsement.</P>
              <P>(iv) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, any acreage of spring barley or wheat damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.</P>
              <P>(v) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of fall planted barley or fall planted wheat is not insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we determine, in writing, that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance will attach as specified in section 7(a)(2)(v)(C).</P>
              <P>(A) Your request for coverage must include the location and number of acres of fall planted barley or wheat.</P>
              <P>(B) The fall planted barley or fall planted wheat will be insured as a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(C) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting date.</P>
              <P>(D) Any acreage of such fall planted barley or fall planted wheat that is damaged after it is accepted for insurance but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree it is not practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(E) If fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as uninsured fall planted acreage.</P>
              <P>(b) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the following applicable date:</P>
              <P>(1) September 25 in Alaska;</P>
              <P>(2) July 31 in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee; or</P>
              <P>(3) October 31 in all other states.</P>

              <P>In addition to the provisions under section 12 of the Basic Provisions, any loss covered by this policy must occur within the insurance period.</P>
              <P>The specific causes of loss for small grains are:</P>
              <P>(a) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(b) Fire;</P>
              <P>(c) Insects, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(d) Plant disease, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(e) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(f) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(g) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss specified in sections 8(a) through (g) that also occurs during the insurance period; or</P>

              <P>(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the direct result of an uninsured cause of loss <PRTPAGE P="175"/>specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Replanting Payments</HD>
              <P>(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these crop provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) You must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions (except as allowed in section 9(a)(1)) and in any winter coverage endorsement for which you are eligible and which you have elected;</P>
              <P>(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage;</P>
              <P>(4) The acreage must have been initially planted to a spring type of the insured crop in those counties with only a spring final planting date;</P>
              <P>(5) Damage must occur after the fall final planting date in those counties where both a fall and spring final planting date are designated (If the Special Provisions provide more than one fall final planting date, the fall final planting date applicable to policies with the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement will be used for this purpose, regardless of whether or not the endorsement is actually in effect.); and</P>
              <P>(6) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that is considered appropriate by agricultural experts for the insured crop, type and practice.</P>
              <P>(b) No replanting payment will be made for acreage initially planted to a winter type of the insured crop (including rye) in any county for which the Special Provisions contain only a fall final planting date (including final planting dates in December, January and February).</P>
              <P>(c) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be:</P>
              <P>(1) The lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or the number of bushels for the applicable crop specified below:</P>
              <P>(i) Two bushels for flax or buckwheat;</P>
              <P>(ii) Four bushels for wheat; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Five bushels for barley or oats;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplied by:</P>
              <P>(i) Your price election for oats, flax or buckwheat; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Your projected price for wheat or barley; and</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplied by your share.</P>
              <P>(d) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(e) Replanting payments will be calculated using your price election or your projected price, as applicable, and your production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and insured. For example, if damaged spring wheat is replanted to durum wheat, your projected price applicable to durum wheat will be used to calculate any replanting payment that may be due. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the following will have a replanting payment based on your production guarantee and your price election or your projected price, as applicable, for the crop type initially planted:</P>
              <P>(1) Any damaged winter crop type that is replanted to a spring crop type, but that retains insurance based on the winter crop type; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any acreage replanted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of the insured crop.</P>

              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres of each insured crop or type, as applicable by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection for barley or wheat;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production guarantee (per acre) and your price election for oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection for barley or wheat;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the production to count of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:</P>

              <P>(i) Projected price for wheat or barley if you elected yield protection;<PRTPAGE P="176"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Price election for oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat; or</P>

              <P>(4) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(5) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(4) from the result of section 11(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(6) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(5) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of wheat in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 45 bushels, your projected price is $3.40, your harvest price is $3.45, and your production to count is 2,000 bushels.</P>
              <P>If you elected yield protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (45 bushel production guarantee × $3.40 projected price) = $7,650.00 value of the production guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 2,000 bushel production to count × $3.40 projected price = $6,800.00 value of the production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $7,650.00−$6,800.00 = $850.00</P>
              <P>(6) $850.00 × 1.000 share = $850.00 indemnity; or</P>
              <P>If you elected revenue protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (45 bushel production guarantee × $3.45 harvest price) = $7,762.50 revenue protection guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 2,000 bushel production to count × $3.45 harvest price = $6,900.00 value of the production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $7,762.50−$6,900.00 = $862.50</P>

              <P>(c) The total production to count (in bushels) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat, and barley or wheat under yield protection, not less than the production guarantee (per acre), and for barley or wheat under revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:</P>

Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature wheat, barley, oat, rye, and buckwheat production may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Flax production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies only. If a moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:</P>
              <P>(i) 13.5 percent for wheat;</P>
              <P>(ii) 14.5 percent for barley;</P>

              <P>We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain including the definition of terms used in section 11(d), result in:</P>
              <P>(A) Wheat, except Khorasan, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight; total damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); shrunken or broken kernels; defects (foreign material and heat damage will not be considered to be defects); a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor); or grading garlicky, light smutty, smutty or ergoty;</P>

              <P>(B) Barley, except hull-less barley, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight; percentage of sound barley (heat-damaged kernels will be considered to be sound barley); damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); thin barley; black barley; a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable <PRTPAGE P="177"/>foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading blighted, smutty, garlicky or ergoty;</P>
              <P>(C) Oats, except hull-less oats, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grade U.S. sample grade) because of test weight; percentage of sound oats (heat-damaged kernels will be considered to be sound oats); a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading smutty, thin, garlicky or ergoty;</P>
              <P>(D) Rye not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of test weight; percent damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); thin rye; a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading light smutty, smutty, light garlicky, garlicky, or ergoty;</P>
              <P>(E) Flaxseed not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. sample grade) due to test weight; damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); or a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor);</P>
              <P>(ii) Deficiencies in the quality of buckwheat, determined in accordance with applicable state grading standards, result in it not meeting No. 3 grade requirements due to test weight; a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading garlicky, smutty or ergoty if such grades are provided for by the applicable state grading standards;</P>
              <P>(iii) Quality factors for Khorasan fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause durum wheat to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if durum wheat grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel, Khorasan would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of durum wheat will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of Khorasan seed. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to Khorasan at the same levels applicable to durum wheat;</P>
              <P>(iv) Quality factors for hull-less barley fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause barley to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if barley grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less barley would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of barley will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less barley. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less barley at the same levels applicable to barley;</P>
              <P>(v) Quality factors for hull-less oats fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause oats to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if oats grade less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less oats would be eligible for quality adjustment if the test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of oats will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less oats. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less oats at the same levels applicable to oats; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Substances or conditions are present, including mycotoxins, that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions;</P>
              <P>(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</P>
              <P>(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed by:</P>
              <P>(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</P>
              <P>(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</P>
              <P>(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</P>

              <P>(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.<PRTPAGE P="178"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Small grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 11(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>A late planting period is applicable to small grains, except to any barley or wheat acreage covered under the terms of the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement. Barley or wheat covered under the terms of the Winter Coverage Endorsement must be planted on or prior to the applicable final planting date specified in the Special Provisions. In counties having one fall final planting date for acreage covered under the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement and another fall final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement, the fall late planting period will begin after the final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>In counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop. Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of the Small Grains Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein.</P>
              <P>2. This endorsement is available only in counties for which the Special Provisions for the insured crop designate both a fall final planting date and a spring final planting date, and for which the actuarial documents provide a premium rate for this coverage.</P>
              <P>3. You must have a Small Grains Crop Insurance Policy in force and elect to insure barley or wheat under that policy.</P>
              <P>4. You must select this coverage, by crop, on your application for insurance. Failure to do so means you have rejected this coverage for both wheat and barley and this endorsement is void.</P>
              <P>5. In addition to the requirements of section 34(b) of the Basic Provisions and section 2 of the Small Grains Crop Provisions, optional units may be established for barley if each optional unit contains only initially planted winter barley or only initially planted spring barley.</P>
              <P>6. If you elect this endorsement for winter barley, the contract change, cancellation, and termination dates applicable to wheat in the county will be applicable to all your spring and winter barley.</P>
              <P>7. Coverage under this endorsement begins on the later of the date we accept your application for coverage or on the fall final planting date designated in the Special Provisions. Coverage ends on the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>8. The provisions of section 14 of the Basic Provisions are amended to require that all notices of damage be provided to us by the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>9. All eligible acreage of each crop covered under this endorsement must be insured.</P>
              <P>10. The amount of any indemnity paid under the terms of this endorsement will be subject to any reduction specified in the Basic Provisions for multiple crop benefits in the same crop year.</P>
              <P>11. Whenever any winter wheat or barley is damaged during the insurance period and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured planted acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may, at your option, take one of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(a) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Basic Provisions, the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions and this endorsement.</P>

              <P>(b) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of the insured crop, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms of section 9 (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions. By doing so, coverage will <PRTPAGE P="179"/>continue under the terms of the Basic Provisions, the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions and this endorsement, and the production guarantee for winter wheat or barley will remain in effect.</P>
              <P>(c) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you agree to accept an appraised amount of production determined in accordance with section 11(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions to count against the unit production guarantee. This amount will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in section 11 (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions. You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop if such insurance is available. If you elect to plant and elect to insure a spring type of the same crop (you must elect whether or not you want insurance on the spring type of the same crop at the time we release the winter type acreage), you must pay additional premium for the insurance. Such acreage will be insured in accordance with the policy provisions that are applicable to acreage that is initially planted to a spring type of the insured crop, and you must:</P>
              <P>(1) Plant the spring type in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining acreage of the winter type; and</P>
              <P>(2) Store or market the production in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring type production separately from any winter type production. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring type acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter type unit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Option A (30 Percent Coverage and Acreage Release)</HD>
              <P>Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period (see section 3, above), and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may take any one of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(a) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you agree to accept an amount of production to count against the unit production guarantee equal to 70 percent of the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, or an appraisal determined in accordance with paragraph 11.(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101) if such an appraisal results in a greater amount of production. This amount will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions under section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101). You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage for the production of spring wheat, you must:</P>

              <P>In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us.</P>
              <P>(b) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101), and this Option.</P>
              <P>(c) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions (§ 457.101). By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101), and this Option, and the production guarantee for winter wheat will remain in effect.</P>

              <P>(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Basic Provisions, in the event of damage or loss, at our option or if required by FCIC in the Special Provisions, you may be required to leave the cotton stalks intact for our inspection. If applicable, the stalks must not be destroyed, and required samples must not be harvested, until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed and written notice of probable loss given to us.</P>
              <P>(b) Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by your respective:</P>

              <P>(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or<PRTPAGE P="182"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 10(b)(1)(i) or 10(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the production to count by your:</P>
              <P>(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(4) Totaling the results of section 10(b)(3)(i) or 10(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(5) Subtracting the result of section 10(b)(4) from the result of section 10(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(6) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(5) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of cotton in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 525 pounds, your projected price is $.65, your harvest price is $.70, and your production to count is 25,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>If you elected yield protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (525 pound production guarantee × $.65 projected price) = $17,062.50 value of the production guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 25,000 pound production to count × $.65 projected price = $16,250.00 value of production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $17,062.50−$16,250.00 = $812.50</P>
              <P>(6) $812.50 × 1.000 share = $813.00 indemnity; or</P>
              <P>If you elected revenue protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (525 pound production guarantee × $.70 harvest price) = $18,375.00 revenue protection guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 25,000 pound production to count × $.70 harvest price = $17,500.00 value of the production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $18,375.00−$17,500.00 = $875.00</P>
              <P>(6) $875.00 × 1.000 share = $875.00 indemnity.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For yield protection, not less than the production guarantee and for revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; or</P>
              <P>(E) If applicable, on which the cotton stalks are destroyed, in violation of section 9.</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of white cotton may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with subsection 10(d)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature white cotton may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by insured causes. Such production to count will be reduced if the price quotation for cotton of like quality (price quotation “A”) for the applicable growth area is less than 85 percent of price quotation “B.”</P>
              <P>(1) Price B is defined as the Upland Cotton National Average Loan Rate determined by FSA, or as specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) Price A is defined as the loan value per pound for the bale determined in accordance with the FSA Schedule of Premiums and Discounts for the applicable crop year, or as specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to count will be determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor derived from dividing price quotation “A” by 85 percent of price quotation “B.”</P>
              <P>(e) Colored cotton lint will not be eligible for quality adjustment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the Basic Provisions, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield without adjustment for skip-row planting patterns.</P>

              <P>(b) Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for <PRTPAGE P="183"/>timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(f) Mature AUP cotton harvested or appraised from acreage originally planted to ELS cotton in the same growing season will be reduced by the factor obtained by dividing the price per pound for AUP cotton by the price per pound for ELS cotton. The prices used for AUP and ELS cotton will be calculated using the Upland Cotton National Average Loan Rate determined by FSA and the Extra Long Staple Cotton National Average Loan Rate determined by FSA, or as specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Late Planting.</HD>
              <P>(a) A late planting period is applicable to ELS cotton, if allowed by the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Special Provisions do not provide for a late planting period, any ELS cotton that is planted after the final planting date will not be insured unless you were prevented from planting it by the final planting date. Such acreage will be insurable, and the production guarantee and premium for the acreage will be determined in accordance with section 16 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the Basic Provisions, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield without adjustment for skip-row planting patterns.</P>
              <P>(b) Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will be divided into additional basic units by each citrus crop designated in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) Sections 34(b) (1), (3), and (4) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.</P>
              <P>(d) Instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number optional units may be established if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>(a) In lieu of the requirement of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibits you from selecting more than one coverage level for each insured crop, you may select a different coverage level for each crop designated in the Special Provisions that you elect to insure.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) If you insure trees within a crop which are either of a different variety or are planted at a different population density, the per acre amount of insurance for each variety or population density for the crop must bear the same relationship to the maximum amount of insurance available for each variety and population density of the crop as specified in the Actuarial documents. For example, if you elect 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a variety within a population density for the crop, you must select 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for that variety for all population densities for the crop. The amount of insurance for each variety and population density must be multiplied by any applicable factor contained in section 3(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of insurance per acre will be the product obtained by multiplying the reference maximum dollar amount of insurance that is shown in the actuarial documents for the applicable population density by the percentage for the level of coverage you select and by:</P>
              <P>(i) Thirty-three percent (0.33) for the year of set out, the year following dehorning, or the year following grafting of a set out tree. (Insurance will be limited to this amount until trees that are set out are one year of age or older on the first day of the crop year);</P>
              <P>(ii) Sixty percent (0.60) for the first growing season after being set out, the second year following dehorning, or the second year following grafting of a set out tree;</P>
              <P>(iii) Eighty percent (0.80) for the second growing season after being set out, the third year following dehorning, or the third year following grafting of a set out tree; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Ninety percent (0.90) for the third growing season after being set out, the fourth year following dehorning, or the fourth year following grafting of a set out tree.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of insurance per acre for each population density, or factor as appropriate, will be multiplied by the applicable number of insured acres. These results will then be added together to determine the amount of insurance for the unit.</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of insurance will be reduced proportionately for any unit on which the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the original planting pattern. For example, if the amount of insurance you selected is $2,000 and the remaining stand is 85 percent of the original stand, the amount of insurance on which the premium and any indemnity will be based is $1,700 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.85).</P>
              <P>(5) If any insurable acreage of trees is set out after the first day of the crop year, and you elect to insure such acreage during that crop year, you must report the acreage, practice, crop, number of trees, date set out is completed, and your share to us within 72 hours after set out is completed for the unit.</P>
              <P>(6) Production reporting requirements contained in section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), are not applicable.</P>
              <P>(7) You must report, by the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions, by type if applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the amount of insurance, and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(iii) The date of original set out and the planting pattern;</P>

              <P>(iv) The date of replacement or dehorning, if more than 10 percent of the trees on any <PRTPAGE P="187"/>unit have been replaced or dehorned in the previous 5 years; and</P>
              <P>(v) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(A) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(B) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(C) Any other information that we request in order to establish your amount of insurance.</P>
              <P>We will reduce the amount of insurance as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanting a perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce the potential for the insured crop, we will reduce your amount of insurance as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Annual Premium</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 7 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), for the 1998 crop year, the premium amount otherwise payable for the 1998 crop year will be increased by 46 percent as a result of the additional six months of coverage for that crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all of each citrus tree crop designated in the Special Provisions in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents and that you elect to insure:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have an ownership share;</P>
              <P>(2) That is adapted to the area;</P>
              <P>(3) That is set out for the purpose of growing fruit to be harvested for the commercial production of fresh fruit or for juice;</P>
              <P>(4) That is irrigated; and</P>
              <P>(5) That have the potential to produce at least 70 percent of the county average yield for the crop and age, unless a written agreement is approved to insure the trees with lesser potential.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we do not insure any citrus trees:</P>
              <P>(1) During the crop year the application for insurance is filed, unless we inspect the acreage and consider it acceptable; or</P>
              <P>(2) That have been grafted onto existing root stock or nursery stock within the one-year period prior to the date insurance attaches.</P>
              <P>(c) We may exclude from insurance or limit the amount of insurance on any acreage that was not insured the previous year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, citrus trees interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable, unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) The insurance period is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For the 1998 crop year only, coverage will begin on June 1, 1997, and will end on November 20, 1998.</P>
              <P>(2) For all subsequent crop years, coverage begins on November 21 of the calendar year prior to the year the insured crop normally blooms, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet the requirements for insurability contained in your policy. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the grove.</P>
              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is November 20.</P>
              <P>(b) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>

              <P>(c) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus trees on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:<PRTPAGE P="188"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), in case of damage or probable loss, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning, dehorning, or removal of any damaged trees.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) In the event of damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on a unit basis by:</P>
              <P>(1) Determining the actual percent of damage for the unit in accordance with sections 12 (b), (c), and (d);</P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting your deductible from the percent of damage for the unit (this result must be greater than zero to receive an indemnity);</P>
              <P>(3) Dividing the result of section 12(a)(2) by your coverage level percentage;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(3) by the amount of insurance per acre determined in accordance with section 3(b)(2);</P>

              <P>(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(5) by your share.</P>
              <P>(b) The percent of damage for any tree will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For damage occurring during the year of set out (trees that have not been set out for at least one year at the time insurance attaches):</P>
              <P>(i) One-hundred percent (100%) whenever there is no live wood above the bud union;</P>
              <P>(ii) Ninety percent (90%) whenever there is less than 12 inches of live wood above the bud union; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The tree will be considered undamaged whenever there is more than 12 inches of live wood above the bud union; or</P>
              <P>(2) For damage occurring in any year following the year of set out:</P>
              <P>(i) The percentage of damage will be determined by dividing the number of scaffold limbs damaged in an area from the trunk to a length equal to one-fourth (<FR>1/4</FR>) the height of the tree, by the total number of scaffold limbs before damage occurred. Whenever this percentage exceeds 80 percent, the tree will be considered as 100 percent damaged.</P>
              <P>(ii) The percent of damage for the unit will be determined by computing the average of the determinations made for the individual trees. If this percent of damage exceeds 80 percent, the unit will be considered 100 percent damaged.</P>
              <P>(c) The percent of damage on the unit will be reduced by the percentage of damage due to uninsured causes.</P>

              <P>(2) Exclude such acreage, we will disregard the acreage for all purposes related to this policy.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the provisions in section 6 of the Basic Provisions, if you fail to notify us of your election to insure or exclude citrus acreage, and the potential production from such acreage is 100 or more boxes per acre, we will determine the percent of damage on all of the insurable acreage for the unit, but will not allow the percent of damage for the unit to be increased by including such acreage.</P>
              <P>(e) Potential production will be determined during loss adjustment.</P>

              <P>(a) In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to interplanted acreage:</P>
              <P>(1) Citrus fruit from trees interplanted with another commodity type or another agricultural commodity is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <P>(2) If the citrus fruit is from trees interplanted with another commodity type or another agricultural commodity, acreage will be prorated according to the percentage of the acres occupied by each of the interplanted commodity types or agricultural commodities. For example, if grapefruit have been interplanted with oranges on 100 acres and the grapefruit trees are on 50 percent of the acreage, grapefruit will be considered planted on 50 acres and oranges will be considered planted on 50 acres.</P>
              <P>(3) The combination of the citrus fruit acreage and the interplanted acreage cannot exceed the physical amount of acreage.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to section 9 of the Basic Provisions, any acreage of citrus fruit that has been abandoned is not insurable.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) Coverage begins on May 1 of each crop year, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) For new or carryover policies, as applicable, we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements for insurability contained in your policy (You must provide any information we require, so we may determine the condition of the acreage to be insured); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For carryover policies, you report additional citrus acreage, or a greater share, such that the amount of insurance will increase by more than 10 percent and we notify you all or a part of your citrus acreage is not insurable.</P>
              <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year, unless specified otherwise in the Special Provisions, is:</P>
              <P>(i) February 7 for navel oranges, Orlando tangelos and tangerines;</P>

              <P>(1) Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date for the crop year is not insurable unless a transfer of coverage and right to indemnity is executed in accordance with section 28 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus fruit on or before the acreage reporting date of the crop year, insurance will not attach, no premium will be due, and no indemnity payable, for such acreage for that crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss to citrus fruit that occur within the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;</P>
              <P>(2) Freeze;</P>
              <P>(3) Hail;</P>
              <P>(4) Hurricane;</P>
              <P>(5) Tornado;</P>
              <P>(6) Excess wind; or</P>
              <P>(7) Diseases, but only if specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Damage to the blossoms or trees; or</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the citrus fruit for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">10. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) If any citrus fruit within a unit is damaged by an insurable cause of loss, we will settle your claim by:</P>

              <P>(1) Calculating the amount of insurance for the unit by multiplying the number of acres by the respective dollar amount of insurance per acre for each applicable combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class <PRTPAGE P="192"/>of trees in the unit and multiplying that result by your share;</P>
              <P>(2) Calculating the average percent of damage to the fruit within each respective combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent (0.1%) (To determine the percent of damage, the amount of citrus fruit damaged from an insured cause must be converted to boxes and divided by the potential production);</P>
              <P>(3) Subtracting the deductible from the result of section 10(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) If the result of section 10(b)(3) is positive, dividing this result by the coverage level percentage (If the result of section 10(b)(3) is negative, no indemnity will be due);</P>
              <P>(5) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(4) by the amount of insurance for the unit for the respective combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees, to determine the value of all damage; and</P>
              <P>(6) Totaling all such results of section 10(b)(5) for all applicable combinations of commodity types, intended uses, and age classes of trees in the unit and subtracting any indemnities paid for the current crop year to determine the amount payable for the unit. For example, assume a 55-acre unit sustains late season damage. No previous damage has occurred on the unit during the crop year and no fruit has been harvested. The producer elected the 75 percent coverage level and has a 100 percent share. The amount of insurance is $1,180 per acre, based on the 75 percent coverage level, for the commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees. The amount of potential production is 24,530 boxes and the amount of damaged production is 17,171 boxes. The loss would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>1. 55 acres × $1,180 = $64,900 amount of insurance for the unit;</P>
              <P>2. 17,171 ÷ 24,530 = 70 percent average percent of damage;</P>
              <P>3. 70 percent damage −25 percent deductible (100 percent −75 percent) = 45 percent;</P>
              <P>4. 45 percent ÷ 75 percent = 60 percent adjusted damage; and</P>
              <P>5. 60 percent × $64,900 = $38,940 indemnity.</P>
              <P>(c) Any individual citrus fruit will be considered 100 percent damaged, if due to an insurable cause of loss it is:</P>
              <P>(1) On the ground and unmarketable; or</P>
              <P>(2) Unmarketable because it is immature, unwholesome, decomposed, adulterated, or otherwise unfit for human consumption.</P>
              <P>(d) Any citrus fruit that can be processed into products for human consumption will be considered marketable. The percent of damage for the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(1) Subtracting the juice content of the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) from:</P>
              <P>(i) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are acceptable to us; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The default juice content provided in the Special Provisions, if at least three years of acceptable juice records are not furnished or the citrus fruit is insured as fresh;</P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting the juice content of the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) from the official weight per box for the applicable commodity type provided in the Special Provisions;</P>
              <P>(3) Dividing the result of section 10(d)(1) by the result of 10(d)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Dividing the official weight per box for the applicable commodity type provided in the Special Provisions by:</P>
              <P>(i) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are acceptable to us; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The default juice content provided in the Special Provisions, if at least three years of acceptable juice records are not furnished or the citrus fruit is insured as fresh; and</P>
              <P>(5) Multiplying the result of section 10(d)(3) by the result of 10(d)(4); and</P>
              <P>(6) For citrus fruit insured as fresh that has a Fresh Fruit Factor listed in the Special Provisions, making an additional adjustment to the percent of damage by:</P>
              <P>(i) Subtracting the result of section 10(d)(5) from 1;</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result of section 10(d)(6)(i) by the applicable Fresh Fruit Factor located in the Special Provisions; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Adding the result of section 10(d)(6)(ii) to the result of section 10(d)(5).</P>
              <P>(e) Notwithstanding section 10(d), for citrus fruit insured as fresh, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions, any individual citrus fruit not meeting the applicable United States Standards for packing as fresh fruit due to an insured cause of loss will be considered 100 percent damaged, except that the percent of damage for any production sold for an alternative use will be adjusted in accordance with section 10(d).</P>

              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(1)(i) or 11(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>

              <P>If you elected yield protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (1,250 pound production guarantee × $.11 projected price) = $6,875.00 value of the production guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 54,000 pound production to count × $.11 projected price = $5,940.00 value of production to count</P>

              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, <PRTPAGE P="195"/>representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us, (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>

The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the havested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting the total production to count from the result in paragraph (b)(1);</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(2) by your price election; and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(3) by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production;</P>

              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement <PRTPAGE P="198"/>on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Harvested production or unharvested production that is appraised after the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts harvested production and that meets the minimum acceptable standards contained in the production agreement or corporate resolution will be converted to pounds of raw sugar by multiplying the tons of such production by 2,000 and by the average percentage of raw sugar to determine the production to count. The average percentage of raw sugar will be determined from tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us at the time of delivery or sample acquisition (appraisal).</P>
              <P>(1) If individual tests of raw sugar content are not made at the time of delivery, the average percent of raw sugar may be based on the results of your previous tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us during the crop year if it is determined that such results are representative of the total production.</P>
              <P>(2) If not representative, the average percent of raw sugar will equal the raw sugar content percent shown in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) Harvested production or unharvested production that is appraised after the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts harvested production and that does not meet the minimum acceptable standards contained in the production agreement or corporate resolution due to an insured peril will be converted to pounds of raw sugar by multiplying the tons of such damaged production by 2,000 and by the average percent of raw sugar contained in such production. The average percentage of raw sugar will be determined from tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us at the time of crop delivery or sample acquisition (appraisal).</P>
              <P>(1) If individual tests of raw sugar content are not made at the time of delivery, the average percent of raw sugar may be based on the results of your previous tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us during the crop year if it is determined that such results are representative of the total production.</P>
              <P>(2) If not representative, the average percent of raw sugar will equal the raw sugar content percent shown in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(f) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity. If the percentage of insured acreage in the unit harvested prior to full maturity exceeds the threshold specified in the actuarial documents, production to count from such acreage will be determined by increasing the amount of harvested production by 1 percent per day for each day the sugar beets were harvested prior to the date the sugar beets would have reached full maturity.</P>
              <P>(1) The date the sugar beets would have reached full maturity will be considered to be 45 days prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(f) * * *</P>
              <P>(2) The adjustment will not be made if the sugar beets are damaged by an insurable cause of loss and leaving the crop in the field would reduce production.</P>
              <P>(3) The adjustment cannot result in a yield greater than the higher of your approved actual production history yield or the actual yield of the production harvested after full maturity from the unit.</P>
              <P>(4) The adjustment will only be made if early harvest is required in the production agreement, or the processor requests early harvest prior to full maturity.</P>
              <P>(5) If the production agreement does not require early harvest and the processor has not requested early harvest, and the processor:</P>
              <P>(i) Accepts the early harvested production, the early harvested production will be counted but no early harvest adjustment will apply.</P>
              <P>(ii) Does not accept the early harvested production, the production to count will be the production guarantee for the acreage harvested early.</P>
              <P>(g) If harvested production is damaged due to an insurable cause of loss and is rejected by the processor but is sold to a salvage buyer at a reduced price: Compute the pounds of raw sugar of the sold production by dividing the gross dollar amount paid by the salvage buyer by the established price.</P>

              <P>(h) If production is damaged due to an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the processor will not accept the production, such as the production did not meet the <PRTPAGE P="199"/>standards contained in the production agreement; and there are no salvage markets for the production, then there would be no value for production and there would be no production to count provided the production is destroyed in a manner acceptable to us.</P>

              <P>(5) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield. We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: Interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>

              <P>By applying for fig crop insurance, you authorize us to have access to and to determine or verify your production and acreage from records maintained by the California Fig Advisory Board and the fig packer.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>The crop insured will be all the commercially grown dried figs that are grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(a) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(b) That are grown for harvest as dried figs;</P>

              <P>(4) Grown on acreage acquired for the crop year unless such acreage has been inspected and accepted by us.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions, that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, figs interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) Coverage begins on March 1, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after February 19 but prior to March 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.</P>
              <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is October 31 or the date harvest of the figs (by type) should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested (Exceptions, if any, for specific counties or varieties or varietal group are contained in the Special Provisions).</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(c) If your fig policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the provisions under section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), any loss covered by this policy must occur within the insurance period. The specific causes of loss for figs are:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(3) Fire;</P>

              <P>(5) Wildlife; or</P>
              <P>(6) Failure of the irrigation water supply.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against contained in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against:</P>
              <P>(1) Any loss of production due to fire, where weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or tree pruning debris has not been removed from the grove; or</P>
              <P>(2) The inability to market the fruit as a direct result of quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any entity to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>

              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;<PRTPAGE P="201"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying this result by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production (pounds) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include all harvested and appraised marketable figs.</P>
              <P>(1) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade manufacturing grade will be adjusted by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the value per pound of the manufacturing grade production by the highest price election available for the insured type; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of pounds of such manufacturing grade production.</P>
              <P>(2) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade substandard and are delivered to the substandard pool will not be considered production to count, provided all the insured's substandard production is inspected by us and we give written consent to such delivery prior to delivery. If we do not give written consent prior to the delivery to the substandard pool, all production will be counted as undamaged marketable production. Substandard production for which we give written consent to you prior to delivery to the substandard pool, which is not delivered to the substandard pool, and is sold by you, will be considered production to count and adjusted as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the value per pound received for such substandard production by the highest price election available for the insured type; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of pounds of such substandard production.</P>
              <P>(3) Appraised production to be counted will include:</P>
              <P>(i) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes and failure to follow recognized good fig farming practices;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not less than the production guarantee for the figs on any acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned without our consent;</P>
              <P>(B) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(c) If the figs are destroyed by you without our consent; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production which would be marketable if harvested; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you want to abandon and no longer care for if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine actual production. You must notify us within three days of the date harvest should have started if the crop is not harvested; or</P>
              <P>(B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop. We will determine the amount of production to count for the acreage using the harvested production or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You may select different coverage levels and percent of price elections for each type in the county as specified in the Special Provisions, unless you elect Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) on any type.</P>
              <P>(1) For example, if you choose 75 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 65 percent coverage level and 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type. However, if you elect the CAT level of coverage for any pear type, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured pear acreage for all types in the county.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding section 3(b)(2) of the Basic Provisions, pear types will not be considered as separate crops and will not be subject to separate administrative fees.</P>
              <P>(b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), by type:</P>
              <P>(1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(c) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any situation listed in sections 3(b)(1) through (b)(4). If the situation occurred:</P>
              <P>(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the situation was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss (If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance);</P>
              <P>(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or</P>
              <P>(3) After the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, production lost due to uninsured causes equal to the amount of the reduction in yield used to establish your production guarantee will be applied in determining any indemnity (see section 11(c)(1)(ii)). We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees.</P>
              <P>(d) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.</P>

              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, pears interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) For the year of application, coverage begins:</P>
              <P>(i) In California, on February 1, except that if your application is received after January 22 but prior to February 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements (You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard); or</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other states, on November 21, except that if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements (You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard).</P>
              <P>(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring an existing policy to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is:</P>
              <P>(i) September 15 for all types of summer or fall pears;</P>
              <P>(ii) October 15 for all types of winter pears; or</P>
              <P>(iii) As otherwise provided for specific types in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(4) If your pear policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any insurable acreage of pears on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due, and no indemnity paid, for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>
              <P>(3) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(4) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(5) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(6) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures; or</P>
              <P>(7) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure of the fruit to color properly; or</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the pears for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>

              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples in accordance with our procedures.<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(3) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the results of section 11(b)(1) by your price election for each type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable, by your price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>Basic Coverage Example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share of a 20-acre pear orchard located in a state other than California. You elect 100 percent of the $500/ton price election. You have a production guarantee of 15 tons/acre; you are only able to produce 10 tons of pears per acre. Your indemnity will be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 20 acres × 15 tons/acre = 300-ton production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) $500/ton (100 percent of the price election) × 300-ton production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) = $150,000 value of production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 20 acres × 10 tons = 200-ton production to count;</P>
              <P>(5) $500/ton (100 percent of the price election) × 200-ton production to count = $100,000 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $150,000 value of production guarantee—$100,000 value of production to count = $50,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $50,000 × 100 percent share = $50,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">[End of Example]</HD>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) For all states except California, all harvested and appraised marketable pear production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) For California, all harvested and appraised production that:</P>

              <P>(i) Meets the standards for first grade canning as defined by the California Pear Advisory Board or for U.S. Number 1 as defined by the United States Standards for Grades of <PRTPAGE P="205"/>Summer and Fall Pears, or Pears for Processing, or for U.S. Extra Number 1 or U.S. Number 1 as defined by the United States Standards for Grades of Winter Pears;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is accepted by a processor for canning or packing; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Is marketable for any purpose. However, if the pears are damaged by an insured cause, the production to count will be reduced by the greater of the following amounts:</P>
              <P>(A) The excess over ten percent (10%) of pears that are size 165 or smaller for varieties other than Forelle, Seckel or Winter Nelis; or</P>
              <P>(B) The result of dividing the value per ton of such pears by the highest price election for the insured type, subtracting this result from 1.000, and multiplying this difference (if positive) by the number of tons of such pears.</P>
              <P>(d) Any pear production not graded or appraised prior to the earlier of the time pears are placed in storage or the date the pears are delivered to a packer, processor, or other handler will not be considered damaged pear production and will be considered production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Late and Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Fresh Pear Quality Adjustment Endorsement</HD>
              <P>In the event of a conflict between the Pear Crop Insurance Provisions and this option, this option will control. Insured who select this option cannot receive less than the indemnity due under section 11.</P>
              <P>(a) This endorsement applies to any crop year, provided:</P>
              <P>(1) The insured pears are located in a State designated for such coverage on the actuarial documents and for which there is designated a premium rate for this endorsement;</P>
              <P>(2) All the pear trees in the unit are managed for the production of fresh market pears (Units that are not managed for the production of fresh market pears do not qualify for this endorsement);</P>
              <P>(3) You have not elected to insure your pears under the CAT Endorsement;</P>
              <P>(4) You elect it on your application or other form approved by us, and did so on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year for which you wish it to be effective (By doing so, you agree to pay the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents for this optional coverage); and</P>
              <P>(5) You or we do not cancel it in writing on or before the cancellation date. Your election of CAT coverage for any crop year after this endorsement is effective will be considered as notice of cancellation of this endorsement by you.</P>
              <P>(b) If the fresh pear production is damaged by an insured cause of loss, and if eleven percent (11%) or more of the harvested and appraised production does not grade at least U.S. Number 1 in accordance with the United States Standards for Grades of Summer and Fall Pears or the United States Standards for Grades of Winter Pears, as applicable, the amount of production to count will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) By two percent (2%) for each full one percent (1%) in excess of ten percent (10%), when eleven percent (11%) through sixty percent (60%) of the pears fail the grade standard; or</P>
              <P>(2) By one hundred percent (100%) when more than sixty percent (60%) of the pears fail the grade standard.</P>
              <P>(3) If you sell more of your fresh pear production as U.S. Number 1 or better than the quantity of pears determined to grade U.S. Number 1 or better in the appraisal, the quantity of such sold production exceeding the amount determined to grade U.S. Number 1 or better in the appraisal will be included as production to count under this option.</P>
              <P>(c) Marketable production that grades less than U.S. Number 1 due to uninsurable causes not covered by this endorsement will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(d) Any adjustments that reduce your production to count under this option will not be applicable when determining production to count for Actual Production History purposes.</P>
              <P>Fresh Pear Quality Adjustment Example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share of a 20-acre pear orchard. You have a production guarantee of 15 tons/acre. You elect 100 percent of the $500/ton price election. You are only able to produce 10 tons/acre and only 7.5 tons/acre grade U.S. Number 1 or better (7.5 × 20 = 150 tons). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 20 acres × 15 tons per acre = 300 tons production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 300 tons production guarantee × $500/ton = $150,000 value of production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) The value of fresh pear production to count is determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) 200 tons harvested production minus 150 tons that graded U.S. Number 1 or better = 50 tons failing to make grade;</P>
              <P>(ii) 50 tons failing grade/200 tons of production = 25 percent of production failing to grade U.S. Number 1;</P>
              <P>(iii) 25 percent minus 10 percent = 15 percent in excess of 10 percent allowance failing to make grade;</P>

              <P>(iv) 15 percent × 2 = 30 percent total quality adjustment for pears failing to grade U.S. Number 1;<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) 200 tons production × 30 percent quality adjustment = 60 tons of pears failing to make grade;</P>
              <P>(vi) 200 tons production minus 60 tons failing to make grade = 140 tons of quality adjusted fresh pear production to count;</P>
              <P>(vii) 140 tons of quality adjusted fresh pear production to count × $500/ton price election = $70,000 value of fresh pear production to count;</P>
              <P>(4) $150,000 value of production guarantee minus $70,000 value of fresh pear production to count = $80,000 value of loss;</P>
              <P>(5) $80,000 value of loss × 100 percent share = $80,000 indemnity payment.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) You will not receive an indemnity payment on a unit if the seed company refuses to provide us with records we require to determine the dollar value per bushel of production for each variety.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective amount of insurance per acre, by type and variety if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 12(c)(1) if there are more than one type or variety;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the total seed production to count (see section 12(d)) for each type and variety of commercial hybrid sorghum seed by the applicable dollar value per bushel for that type or variety;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total non-seed production to count (see section 12(e)) for each type and variety by the applicable local market price determined on the earlier of the date the non-seed production is sold or the date of final inspection;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of sections 12(c)(3) and 12(c)(4) by type and variety;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(1) if there is only one type or variety, or subtracting the result of 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(2) if there are more than one type or variety; and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(6) by your share.</P>
              <FP>For example:</FP>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development of type “A” hybrid sorghum seed in the unit, with an amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $361 (county yield of 170 bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed payment of zero). Your seed production was 1,400 bushels and the dollar value per bushel was $3.47. Your non-seed production was 100 bushels with a local market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × $361 = $18,050 amount of insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 1,400 bushels × $3.47 = $4,858 value of seed production;</P>

              <P>(4) 100 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production;<PRTPAGE P="210"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) $4,858 + $200 = $5,058;</P>
              <P>(6) $18,050 − $5,058 = $12,992; and</P>
              <P>(7) $12,992 × 100 percent share = $12,992 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development of type “B” hybrid sorghum seed in the unit, with an amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $340 (county yield of 160 bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed payment of zero). You harvested 1,200 bushels and the dollar value per bushel for the harvested amount was $4.63. You also harvested 200 bushels of non-seed with a market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × $361 = $18,050 amount of insurance guarantee for type “A” and 50 acres × $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee for type “B”;</P>
              <P>(2) $18,050 + $17,000 = $35,050 amount of insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 1,400 bushels × $3.47 = $4,858 value of seed production for type “A” and 1,200 bushels × $4.63 = $5,556 value of seed production for type “B”;</P>
              <P>(4) 100 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production for type “A” and 200 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $400 of non-seed production for type “B”</P>
              <P>(5) $4,858 + $200 + $5,556 + $400 = $11,014 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $35,050 − $11,014 = $24,036; and</P>
              <P>(7) $24,036 × 100 percent share = $24,036 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(d) Production to be counted as seed production will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Mature unharvested production with a germination rate of at least 80 percent of the commercial hybrid sorghum seed as determined by a certified seed test. Any such production may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f);</P>
              <P>(iv) Immature appraised production;</P>
              <P>(v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) Harvested production that you deliver as commercial hybrid sorghum seed to the seed company stated in your hybrid sorghum seed processor contract, regardless of quality, unless the production has inadequate germination.</P>
              <P>(e) Production to be counted as non-seed production will include all harvested or mature appraised production that does not qualify as seed production to count as specified in section 12(d). Any such production may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f).</P>
              <P>(f) For the purpose of determining the quantity of mature production:</P>
              <P>(1) Commercial hybrid sorghum seed production will be:</P>
              <P>(i) Increased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture below 13.0 percent; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Decreased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 13.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) When records of commercial hybrid sorghum seed production provided by the seed company have been adjusted to a basis of 13.0 percent moisture and 56 pound avoirdupois bushels, section 12(f)(1) above will not apply to harvested production. In such cases, records of the seed company will be used to determine the amount of production to count, provided that the moisture and weight of such production are calculated on the same basis as that used to determine the approved yield.</P>

              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your amount of insurance for timely planted acreage.

              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 34(a) of the Basic Provisions, you may elect separate enterprise units for FAC or NFAC cropping practices if these cropping practices are allowed by the actuarial documents. If you elect enterprise units for these cropping practices, you may not elect enterprise or optional units by irrigation practices.</P>
              <P>(1) You may elect one enterprise unit for all FAC cropping practices, all NFAC cropping practices, or separate enterprise units for both, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. For example: You may choose an enterprise unit for all FAC acreage (soybeans irrigated practice and non-irrigated practice) and an enterprise unit for all NFAC acreage (soybeans irrigated practice and non-irrigated practice).</P>
              <P>(2) You are only eligible if both FAC and NFAC cropping practices are allowed by the actuarial documents for each irrigation practice you use. If FAC and NFAC cropping practices are only allowed for the non-irrigated practice, separate enterprise units for FAC and NFAC cropping practices are not available if you use the irrigated practice; but if you use only non-irrigated FAC and NFAC cropping practices, separate enterprise units for non-irrigated FAC and NFAC cropping practices are available.</P>
              <P>(3) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4) for each enterprise unit.</P>
              <P>(4) If you elected separate enterprise units for both cropping practices and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for one or the other cropping practice and such discovery is made:</P>
              <P>(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure all acreage of the crop in the county in one enterprise unit provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4), or your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or</P>
              <P>(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4). Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure.</P>
              <P>(5) If you elected an enterprise unit on one cropping practice for FAC or NFAC and a different unit structure on the other cropping practice and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the FAC or NFAC cropping practice and such discovery is made:</P>
              <P>(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or</P>

              <P>(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure.<PRTPAGE P="212"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Instead of establishing optional units as provided in section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions, if allowed by the actuarial documents, you may have separate optional units for the FAC cropping practice and the NFAC cropping practice. These optional units will be by section, section equivalent, or FSA FN and by the FAC cropping practice and the NFAC cropping practice. These optional units cannot be further divided by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage or by acreage insured under an organic farming practice.</P>
              <P>(c) If FAC or NFAC cropping practices are only available by written agreement, separate enterprise units or optional units for FAC or NFAC cropping practices are not available.</P>

              <P>(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Except as specified in section 10(a)(1), you must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions; and</P>
              <P>(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage.</P>

              <P>(b) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting <PRTPAGE P="214"/>payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or the number of bushels (tons for corn insured as silage) for the applicable crop specified below, multiplied by your projected price, multiplied by your share:</P>
              <P>(1) 8 bushels for corn grain;</P>
              <P>(2) 1 ton for corn silage;</P>

              <P>(c) If you will harvest any acreage in a manner other than as you reported it for coverage (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, you reported planting it to harvest as grain but will harvest the acreage for silage, or you reported planting it to harvest as silage but will harvest the acreage for grain), you must notify us before harvest begins. Failure to timely provide notice will result in production to count determined in accordance with section 12(c)(1)(i)(E).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(1)(i) or 12(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the production to count of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;</P>

              <P>(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(5) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of corn in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 115 bushels, your projected price is $2.25, your harvest price is $2.20, and your production to count is 5,000 bushels.</P>
              <P>If you elected yield protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (115 bushel production guarantee × $2.25 projected price) = $12,937.50 value of the production guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 5,000 bushel production to count × $2.25 projected price = $11,250.00 value of the production to count</P>

              <P>(6) $1,687.50 × 1.000 share = $1,688.00 indemnity; or</P>
              <P>If you elected revenue protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (115 bushel production guarantee × $2.25 projected price) = $12,937.50 revenue protection guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 5,000 bushel production to count × $2.20 harvest price = $11,000.00 value of the production to count</P>

              <P>(E) For which you fail to give us notice before harvest begins if you report planting the corn to harvest as grain but harvest it as silage or you report planting the corn to harvest as silage but harvest it as grain.</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 12(d)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you will put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature coarse grain production (excluding corn insured as silage) may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality. Corn insured as silage will be adjusted for excess moisture and quality only as specified in section 12(e).</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:</P>
              <P>(i) Fifteen percent (15%) for corn (If moisture exceeds 30 percent (30%), production will be reduced 0.2 percent for each 0.1 percentage point above 30 percent (30%));</P>
              <P>(ii) Fourteen percent (14%) for grain sorghum; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Thirteen percent (13%) for soybeans.</P>
              <P>We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in:</P>
              <P>(A) Corn not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor;</P>
              <P>(B) Grain sorghum not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor), or meets the special grade requirements for smutty grain sorghum; or</P>
              <P>(C) Soybeans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except garlic odor), or which meet the special grade requirements for garlicky soybeans; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions;</P>
              <P>(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</P>
              <P>(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:</P>
              <P>(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</P>
              <P>(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</P>
              <P>(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</P>
              <P>(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</P>

              <P>(4) Coarse grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 12(d) (2) and (3), will be reduced by the <PRTPAGE P="216"/>quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) For corn insured as silage:</P>
              <P>(1) Whenever our appraisal of grain content is less than 4.5 bushels of grain per ton of silage, the silage production will be reduced by 1 percentage point for each 0.1(1/10) of a bushel less than 4.5 bushels per ton (If we cannot make a grain appraisal before harvest and you do not leave a representative unharvested sample, in accordance with the policy no reduction for grain-deficient silage will be made.); and</P>
              <P>(2) If the normal silage harvesting period has ended, or for any acreage harvested as silage or appraised as silage after the calendar date for the end of the insurance period as specified in section 8(b), we may increase the silage production to count to a 65 percent moisture equivalent to reflect the normal moisture content of silage harvested during the normal silage harvesting period.</P>
              <P>(f) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(a) In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), in the event of damage or loss:</P>
              <P>(1) All sugarcane stubble must remain intact for our inspection; and</P>
              <P>(2) You must give us notice at least 15 days before you begin cutting any sugarcane for seed. Your notice must include the unit number and the number of acres you intend to harvest as seed. Failure to give us timely notice will cause the acreage cut for seed to be considered as put to another use without consent. The production to count for such acreage will not be less than the production guarantee.</P>
              <P>(3) You must request an appraisal if any time during the crop year sugarcane acreage cut for seed will not produce at least the production guarantee so we can determine the production to count. If you do not request an appraisal, the production to count for such acreage will be the production guarantee.</P>
              <P>(b) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), if you initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The stubble must not be destroyed and the required samples must not be harvested until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying this result by your share.

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>

                <P>Assume you have a 100 percent share in a unit of 100 acres of sugarcane, an approved yield of 6,000 pounds of raw sugar per acre, a coverage election of 65 percent, and a price election of $0.12 a pound. The production guarantee would be 3,900 pounds of raw sugar per acre (6,000 × 65%). Further assume that you are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds of raw sugar because the unit was damaged by an insurable cause of loss. <PRTPAGE P="218"/>Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) 100 acres × 3,900 pound production guarantee = 390,000 pound production guarantee;</P>
                <P>(2) 390,000 pound production guarantee−200,000 pounds harvested production = 190,000 pound production loss;</P>
                <P>(3) 190,000 pound production loss × $0.12 price election = $22,800 loss; and</P>
                <P>(4) $22,800 loss × 100 percent share = $22,800 indemnity payment.</P>

Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) 100 acres × 3,900 pound production guarantee = 390,000 pound production guarantee;</P>
                <P>(2) 390,000 pound production guarantee−278,000 (200,000 pounds harvested production + 78,000 pounds production for putting acreage to another use without consent, (20 acres × 3,900 pound production guarantee per acre)) = 112,000 pound production loss;</P>
                <P>(3) 112,000 pound production loss × $0.12 price election = $13,440 loss; and</P>

(The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or</P>

              <P>(d) Harvested sugarcane may be adjusted for low quality if it is damaged by one or more freezes occurring within the insurance period to the extent that it cannot be processed for sugar by the boiling house operation. The amount of production to count for such sugarcane will be determined by dividing the dollar value of the damaged production by the local market price per pound for raw sugar. The prices used for this adjustment will be determined on the earlier of the date such quality-adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit.</P>

              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the insured crop will not be harvested;</P>
              <P>(b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing unless you have records verifying that the forage was direct marketed. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal;</P>
              <P>(c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and will be included as production to count; and</P>
              <P>(d) You must notify us at least 5 days before grazing of insured forage begins so we can conduct an appraisal to determine production to count. Failure to give timely notice that the acreage will be grazed will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, by its respective production guarantee;</P>

              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election you selected;<PRTPAGE P="221"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of each crop type in section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price election you selected;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of each crop type in section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Example 1</HD>
              <P>Assume you have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type A forage in the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price election of $65.00 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only able to harvest 50.0 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>1. 100 acres type A × 3 tons = 300 ton guarantee;</P>
              <P>2 &amp; 3. 300 tons × $65 price election = $19,500 total value guarantee;</P>
              <P>4 &amp; 5. 50 tons production to count × $65 price election = $3,250 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>6. $19,500 value guarantee—$3,250 = $16,250 loss; and</P>
              <P>7. $16,250 × 100 percent share = $16,250 indemnity payment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Example 2</HD>
              <P>Assume you also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type B forage in the same unit, with a guarantee of 1.0 ton per acre and a price election of $50.00 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only able to harvest 5.0 tons. Your total indemnity for forage production for both types A and B in the same unit would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>1. 100 acres × 3 tons = 300 ton guarantee for type A; and 100 acres × 1 ton = 100 ton guarantee for type B;</P>
              <P>2. 300 ton guarantee × $65 price election = $19,500 total value of the guarantee for type A; and 100 ton guarantee × $50 price election = $5,000 total value of the guarantee for type B;</P>
              <P>3. $19,500 + $5,000 = $24,500 total value of the guarantee;</P>
              <P>4. 50 tons × $65 price election = $3,250 total value of production to count for type A; and 5 tons × $50 price election = $250 total value of production to count for type B;</P>
              <P>5. $3,250 + $250 = $ 3,500 total value of production to count for types A and B;</P>
              <P>6. $24,500—$3,500 = $21,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>7. $21,000 loss × 100 percent share = $21,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>

              <P>(iii) Unharvested production;</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached and:</P>
              <P>(A) You do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>

              <P>2. This endorsement provides coverage for malting barley production and quality losses at a price per bushel greater than that offered under the Small Grains Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>3. You must have the Basic Provisions and the Small Grains Crop Provisions in force to elect to insure malting barley under this endorsement.</P>
              <P>4. You must elect either Option A or Option B on or before the sales closing date:</P>
              <P>(a) No coverage will be provided under:</P>
              <P>(1) Either Option A or Option B of this endorsement if you fail to elect either Option A or Option B, or if you elect Option B but fail to have a malting barley contract in effect by the acreage reporting date; or</P>

              <P>(2) Option B of this endorsement if you have not met the production requirements specified in section 1(a) of Option B (in such case, you will only have coverage under the Small Grains Crop Provisions unless you elect coverage under Option A on or before the sales closing date);<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If you elect coverage under Option A, and subsequently enter into a malting barley contract, your coverage will continue under the terms of Option A;</P>
              <P>(c) Your election (Option A or Option B) will continue from year to year unless you cancel or change your election on or before the sales closing date, or your coverage is otherwise canceled or terminated under the terms of your policy; and</P>
              <P>(d) In counties with both fall and spring sales closing dates, you may elect this endorsement until the spring sales closing date only if you do not have any fall planted acreage of approved malting barley varieties.</P>
              <P>5. All acreage in the county planted to approved malting varieties that is insurable under the Small Grains Crop Provisions for feed barley and your elected Option will be insured under this endorsement, except any acreage on which you produce seed under the terms of the seed contract.</P>
              <P>6. In lieu of the definitions and provisions regarding units and unit division in the Basic Provisions and the Small Grains Crop Provisions, all malting barley acreage in the county insured under this endorsement will be considered as one basic unit regardless of whether such acreage is owned, rented for cash, or rented for a share of the crop. Your shares in the malting barley acreage insured under this endorsement must be designated separately on the acreage report. For example, if you have 100 percent share in 50 acres and 75 percent share in 10 acres you must list the 50 acres separately from the 10 acres on your acreage report and include the percent share for each.</P>
              <P>7. You must select a percentage of the additional value price on or before the sales closing date (you can select only one percentage even if more than one additional value price is applicable, and this percentage must be 100 percent or less). In the event you choose a percentage less than 100 percent of the additional value price, we will multiply that percentage by the additional value price specified in Option A or Option B, as applicable, to determine the additional value price applicable to this endorsement.</P>
              <P>8. The additional premium amount for this coverage will be determined by multiplying your malting barley production guarantee (per acre) by your additional value price, by the premium rate, by the acreage planted to approved malting barley varieties, by your share at the time coverage begins. The premium rate you pay will be adjusted by a malting barley factor contained in the actuarial documents, as applicable.</P>
              <P>9. In addition to the reporting requirements contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must provide all the information required by the Option you elect.</P>
              <P>10. In accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) We will settle your claim within 30 days if all production:</P>
              <P>(1) Meets the quality criteria specified in section 14(a)(2) of this endorsement; or</P>
              <P>(2) Grades U.S. No. 4 or worse in accordance with the grades and grade requirements for the subclasses six-rowed and two-rowed barley, or for the class barley in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain; and</P>
              <P>(3) Is not accepted by a buyer for malting purposes; or</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever any production fails one or more of the quality criteria specified in section 14(a)(2) of this endorsement and grades U.S. No. 3 or better, we will not agree upon the amount of loss until the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(1) The date you sell, feed, donate, or otherwise utilize such production for any purpose; or</P>
              <P>(2) May 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the insured malting barley is normally harvested. If you still retain any insured production on or after this date, we will:</P>
              <P>(i) Defer completion of your claim if you agree to such deferment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If you do not agree to defer your claim, we will complete your claim; however, no adjustment for quality deficiencies will be made and all remaining unsold insured production will be considered to have met the quality standards specified in this endorsement.</P>
              <P>11. This endorsement for malting barley does not provide prevented planting coverage. Such coverage is only provided in accordance with the provisions of the Small Grains Crop Provisions for feed barley.</P>
              <P>12. Production from all acreage insured under this endorsement and any production of feed barley varieties must not be commingled prior to our making all determinations under section 14. Failure to keep production separate as required herein will result in denial of your claim for indemnity.</P>
              <P>13. In the event of loss or damage covered by this endorsement, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(a) Multiplying the insured acreage by your malting barley production guarantee (per acre) determined in accordance with section 2 of Option A or Option B, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(b) Multiplying the result in section 13(a) by your respective additional value price per bushel;</P>

              <P>(c) Multiplying the number of bushels of production to count determined in accordance with section 14 by your additional value price per bushel (If more than one additional value price is applicable, the highest additional value price will be used until the number of bushels covered at the higher additional value price is reached and the remainder of the production will be multiplied by <PRTPAGE P="224"/>the lower additional value price. For example, if variety A is grown under a malting barley price agreement and 1000 bushels of variety A are insured using an additional value price of $0.68 per bushel but only 500 bushels of variety A are produced, the 500 bushels would be valued at $0.68 per bushel and all other production of other varieties will be valued at the lower additional value price unless such production is acceptable under the terms of the malting barley price agreement, in which case 500 bushels of the other varieties would also be valued at $0.68 per bushel);</P>
              <P>(d) Subtracting the result of section 13(c) from the result in section 13(b); and</P>
              <P>(e) Multiplying the result of section 13(d) by your share.</P>
              <P>14. The amount of production to be counted against your malting barley production guarantee will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Production to count will include all:</P>
              <P>(1) Appraised production determined in accordance with sections 11(c)(1)(i), (ii) and (iv) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Harvested production and unharvested production that meets, or would meet if properly handled, either the acceptable percentage or parts per million standard contained in any applicable malting barley contract or malting barley price agreement for protein, plump kernels, thin kernels, germination, blight damaged, injured by mold, mold damaged, injured by sprout, injured by frost, frost damaged, and mycotoxins or other substances or conditions identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human health, or the following quality standards (additional or different quality standards may be specified or made available in the Special Provisions), whichever is less stringent:</P>

              <P>(b) For the quantity of production that qualifies under section 14(a)(3), the amount of production to count will be determined by:</P>

              <P>(3) Dividing the result of section 14(b)(1) or (2), as applicable, by 100 percent of the additional value price (The weighted average additional value price will be used in the event more than one additional value price is applicable, for example, if 1000 bushels of variety A are insured with an additional value price of $0.68 and 500 bushels are insured with an additional value price of $0.40, the weighted average additional value price would be $0.59); and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(3) (if less than zero, no production will be counted; or, if more than 1.000, no adjustment will be made) by the number of bushels of damaged production.</P>

              <P>(4) Any other costs associated with normal handling and marketing of malting barley.</P>

              <P>(d) All grade and quality determinations must be based on the results of objective tests. No indemnity will be paid for any loss <PRTPAGE P="225"/>established by subjective tests. We may obtain one or more samples of the insured crop and have tests performed at an official grain inspection location established under the U.S. Grain Standards Act or laboratory of our choice to verify the results of any test.

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">OPTION A (FOR MALTING BARLEY PRODUCTION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER GROWN UNDER A MALTING BARLEY CONTRACT OR PRICE AGREEMENT)</HD>
              <P>1. To be eligible for coverage under this option:</P>
              <P>(a) You must provide us with acceptable records of your sales of malting barley and the number of acres planted to malting varieties for at least the four crop years in your APH database prior to the crop year immediately preceding the current crop year (for example, to determine your production guarantee for the 2011 crop year, records must be provided for the 2006 through the 2009 crop years, if malting barley varieties were planted in each of those crop years);</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to provide acceptable records or reports as required herein will make you ineligible for coverage under this endorsement; and</P>
              <P>(2) You must provide these records to us no later than the production reporting date specified in the Basic Provisions; and</P>
              <P>(b) If you produce malting barley under a malting barley contract or malting barley price agreement, you must provide us with a copy of your current crop year contract or agreement on or before the acreage reporting date if you want the additional value price based on such contract or price agreement. All terms and conditions of the contract or agreement, including the contract price or future contract price, must be specified in the contract or agreement and be effective on or before the acreage reporting date.</P>
              <P>2. Your malting barley production guarantee (per acre) will be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(a) The production guarantee (per acre) for feed barley for acreage planted to approved malting varieties calculated in accordance with the Basic Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(b) A yield per acre calculated by:</P>
              <P>(1) Dividing the number of bushels of malting barley sold each year by the number of acres planted to approved malting barley varieties in each respective year;</P>
              <P>(2) Adding the results of section 2(b)(1);</P>
              <P>(3) Dividing the result of section 2(b)(2) by the number of years approved malting barley varieties were planted; and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the result of section 2(b)(3) by your coverage level.</P>
              <P>3. The additional value price per bushel will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For production grown under a malting barley contract or a malting barley price agreement, the additional value price per bushel will be the following amount, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) The sale price per bushel established in the malting barley contract or malting barley price agreement (not including discounts or incentives that may apply) minus the projected price for barley;</P>

              <P>(3) If your malting barley contract or malting barley price agreement has a variable price option, you must select a price or a method of determining a price that will be treated as the sale price and your additional value price per bushel will be calculated under section 3(a)(1) or (2), as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) The additional value price per bushel designated in the actuarial documents will be used if:</P>

Any bushels in excess of this amount will be insured using the additional value price designated in the actuarial documents.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Loss Example</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 13, your loss will be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Assume the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A producer has:</P>

              <P>(i) 400 acres of barley insured under the Small Grains Crop Provisions, of which 200 <PRTPAGE P="226"/>acres are planted to feed barley and 200 acres are planted to an approved malting barley variety;</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one price election and coverage level for each insured crop (citrus fruit group designated in the Special Provisions) that you elect to insure.</P>

              <P>(1) The price election you choose for each insured crop (citrus fruit group) need not bear the same percentage relationship to the <PRTPAGE P="229"/>maximum price offered by us for each insured crop (citrus fruit group). For example, if you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum price election for one insured crop (citrus fruit group) (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the citrus fruit group for early and midseason oranges), you may choose seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum price election for another insured crop (citrus fruit group) (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the citrus fruit group for late oranges).</P>
              <P>(2) If separate price elections are available by commodity type or intended use within an insured crop (citrus fruit group), the price elections you choose within the insured crop (citrus fruit group) must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each other commodity type or intended use within the insured crop (citrus fruit group). For example, if separate price elections are available for commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of fresh, and commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of juice, and you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the price election for commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of fresh, you must also choose one hundred percent (100%) of the price election for commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of juice.</P>
              <P>(b) The production guarantee per acre is progressive by stage and increases from the first stage production guarantee to the second stage production guarantee. The stages are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The first stage extends from the date insurance attaches through April 30 of the calendar year of normal bloom.</P>
              <P>(2) The second stage extends from May 1 of the calendar year of normal bloom until the end of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(c) Any acreage of citrus damaged in the first stage to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would not further maintain it will be limited to the first stage production guarantee even though you may continue to maintain it.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the reported production, each crop year you must report by commodity type and intended use:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of trees damaged, topped, hedged, pruned or removed; any change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based; and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another agricultural commodity and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the interplanted agricultural commodity and commodity type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(e) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels. Examples of these circumstances that may reduce yield may include, but are not limited to: Interplanted agricultural commodities; removal, topping, hedging, or pruning of trees; damage; and change in practices. If the circumstance occurred:</P>
              <P>(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the circumstance was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss;</P>
              <P>(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or</P>
              <P>(3) Before or after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 12(c) of these Crop Provisions due to uninsured causes. We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees or in the yield potential of the insured acreage.</P>
              <P>(f) The yield used to compute your production guarantee will be determined in accordance with Actual Production History (APH) regulations, 7 CFR part 400, subpart G, and applicable policy provisions.</P>

              <P>(g) In lieu of the provisions in section 3 of the Basic Provisions that require reporting your production for the previous crop year, for each crop year you must report your production from two crop years ago (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> on the 2018 crop year production report, you will provide your 2016 crop year production).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</HD>

              <P>In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates are November 20.<PRTPAGE P="230"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Annual Premium</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the premium computation method in section 7 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the annual premium amount is computed by multiplying the second stage production guarantee per acre by the price election, the premium rate, the insured acreage, your share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium adjustment percentages contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the insured crop will be each citrus fruit group you elect to insure and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That is grown on trees adapted to the area;</P>
              <P>(3) That is irrigated;</P>
              <P>(4) That has produced an average yield of at least three tons per acre the crop year from two years prior reported in accordance with section 3(g), or we have appraised the yield potential of at least three tons per acre;</P>
              <P>(5) That is grown in a grove that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us; and</P>
              <P>(6) That is not sold by direct marketing, unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) For each insured crop (citrus fruit group), administrative fees will be assessed in accordance with section 6 of the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement and section 7 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to an insured crop interplanted with another agricultural commodity, interplanted acreage is uninsurable, except a citrus fruit group interplanted with another perennial agricultural commodity is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period that begins when the application is received by us and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the insured crop (citrus fruit group) or to determine the condition of the grove.</P>
              <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is the second May 31st of the crop year.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due, and no indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Excess rain;</P>
              <P>(2) Excess wind;</P>
              <P>(3) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;</P>
              <P>(4) Freeze;</P>
              <P>(5) Hail;</P>
              <P>(6) Tornado;</P>
              <P>(7) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured peril or drought that occurs during the insurance period; or</P>
              <P>(9) Insects and plant disease, unless excluded or otherwise restricted through the Special Provisions, provided the loss of production is not due to damage resulting from insufficient or improper application of control measures as recommended by agricultural experts.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the citrus for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are <PRTPAGE P="231"/>unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples. In lieu of the requirements of section 14(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions, we will determine which trees must remain unharvested so that we may inspect them in accordance with FCIC procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Special Provisions permit or a written agreement authorizing direct marketing exists, you must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(2) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or within 24 hours if damage is discovered during harvest, so we may have an opportunity to inspect the unit. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on a unit basis by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each combination of commodity type and intended use by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the results of section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election for each combination of commodity type and intended use;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count of each combination of commodity type and intended use (see section 12(c)) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting this result of section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) From which production is sold by direct marketing, if direct marketing is specifically permitted by the Special Provisions or a written agreement, and you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 11;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the insured crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the insured crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the insured crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Any citrus fruit insured with an intended use of juice that is not marketed as fresh fruit and, due to insurable causes, does not contain 120 or more gallons of juice per ton, will be adjusted by:</P>
              <P>(1) Dividing the gallons of juice per ton obtained from the damaged citrus by 120; and</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result by the number of tons of such citrus.</P>

              <P>If individual records of juice content are not available, an average juice content from the nearest juice plant will be used, if available. If not available, a field appraisal will be <PRTPAGE P="232"/>made to determine the average juice content.</P>
              <P>(e) Any citrus fruit insured with an intended use of fresh that is not marketable as fresh fruit due to insurable causes will be adjusted by multiplying the number of tons of such citrus fruit by the applicable Fresh Fruit Factor contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(f) Any production will be considered marketed or marketable as fresh fruit unless, due solely to insured causes, such production was not marketed as fresh fruit.</P>
              <P>(g) In the absence of acceptable records of disposition of harvested citrus fruit, the disposition and amount of production to count for the unit will be the guarantee on the unit.</P>
              <P>(h) Any citrus fruit on the ground that is not harvested will be considered totally lost if damaged by an insured cause.</P>

              <P>(a) Basic units will be established in accordance with section 1 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Unless otherwise allowed by written agreement, optional units may only be established if each optional unit meets one or more of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The optional unit is located on non-contiguous land; and</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by non-contiguous land, optional units may be established by commodity type if allowed by the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may select only one price election and coverage level for each citrus fruit group you elect to insure. The price election you choose for each citrus fruit group need not bear the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each citrus fruit group. For example, if you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum price election for the citrus fruit group for Valencia oranges, you may choose seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum price election for the citrus fruit group for Navel oranges. However, if separate price elections are available by commodity type within each citrus fruit group, the price elections you choose for each commodity type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each commodity type within the citrus fruit group.</P>
              <P>(b) In lieu of reporting your citrus production of marketable fresh fruit for the previous crop year, as required by section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), there is a lag period of one year. Each crop year, you must report your production from two crop years ago, e.g., on the 2015 crop year production report, you will provide your 2013 crop year production.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition, you must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), by commodity type, if applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of trees damaged, dehorned or removed; any change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based; and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial agricultural commodity and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the interplanted agricultural commodity and commodity type, if applicable;</P>

If the situation in 3(c) occurred:</P>
              <P>(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the situation was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss;</P>
              <P>(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or</P>
              <P>(3) After the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 11(c) due to uninsured causes. We may reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the citrus for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples. In lieu of section 14(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions, we will determine which trees must remain unharvested as your representative sample so that we may inspect them in accordance with procedures.<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b)In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Special Provisions permit or a written agreement authorizing direct marketing exists, you must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(2) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest so that we may have an opportunity to inspect unharvested trees. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged insured crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each commodity type by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the results of section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for each commodity type;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each commodity type (see section 11(c)), by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting this result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share;</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in cartons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) From which production is sold by direct marketing, if direct marketing is specifically permitted by the Special Provisions or a written agreement, and you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production determined to be marketable as fresh packed fruit; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the insured crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the insured crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the insured crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count;</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production marketed as fresh packed fruit from the insurable acreage; and</P>
              <P>(3) All citrus that was disposed of or sold without an inspection or written consent.</P>
              <P>(d) Any production will be considered marketed or marketable as fresh packed fruit unless, due solely to insured causes, such production was not marketed or marketable as fresh packed fruit.</P>
              <P>(e) Citrus that cannot be marketed as fresh packed fruit due to insurable causes will not be considered production to count.</P>
              <P>(f) If you elect the frost protection option and we determine that frost protection equipment, as specified in the Special Provisions, was not properly utilized or not properly reported, the indemnity for the unit will be reduced by the percentage of premium reduction allowed for frost protection equipment. You must, at our request, provide us records showing the start-stop times by date for each period the frost protection equipment was used.</P>

              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for each variety or varietal group;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each variety or varietal group, if applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of walnuts in the unit, with a guarantee of 2,500 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.61 per pound. You are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 2,500 pounds = 250,000 pound insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2 &amp; 3) 250,000 pounds × $0.61 price election = $152,500 total value of insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4 &amp; 5) 200,000 pounds production to count × $0.61 price election = $122,000 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $152,500 total value guarantee—$122,000 total value of production to count = $30,500 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $30,500 × 100 percent share = $30,500 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (whole in-shell pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(C) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature walnut production damaged due to an insurable cause of loss which occurs within the insurance period may be adjusted for quality based on an inspection by the Dried Fruit Association or during our loss adjustment process. Walnut production that has mold damage greater than 8 percent, based on the net delivered weight, will be reduced by the quality adjustment factors contained in the Special Provisions. Walnut production that exceeds 30 percent mold damage and will not be sold, the production to count will be zero.</P>

              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one price election for all the almonds in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select one price election for each almond type designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</P>

              <P>(5) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>
              <P>(c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a cause of loss that would or could reduce the yield of the insured crop has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.</P>

              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, almonds interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) Coverage begins on January 1 of each crop year, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after December 21, but prior to January 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.</P>
              <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is November 30.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(4) If your almond policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of almonds on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(6) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period; or</P>
              <P>(8) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the almonds for any reason other than actual physical damage to the almonds from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us prior to the beginning of harvest so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>

              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:<PRTPAGE P="241"/>
              </P>
              <P>(l) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for the type;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable, (see subsection 11(c)) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of almonds in the unit, with a guarantee of 1,200 pounds per acre and a price election of $1.70 per pound. You are only able to harvest 100,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 1,200 pounds = 120,000 pound insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2 &amp; 3) 120,000 pounds × $1.70 price election = $204,000 total value of insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4 &amp; 5) 100,000 pounds production to count × $1.70 price election = $170,000 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $204,000 total of value guarantee—$170,000 total value of production to count = $34,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $34,000 × 100 percent share = $34,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count, specified in meat pounds, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(C) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested meat pounds, including meat pounds damaged due to uninsured causes of loss.</P>

              <P>(a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will be divided into additional basic units by grape variety.</P>
              <P>(b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Amounts of Insurance and Production Reporting</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one coverage level percentage for all the raisins in the county insured under this policy.</P>
              <P>(b) The amount of insurance for the unit will be determined by multiplying the insured tonnage by the reference maximum dollar amount, by the coverage level percentage you elect, and by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) Insured tonnage is determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For units not damaged by rain—The delivered tons; or</P>
              <P>(2) For units damaged by rain—By adding the delivered tons to any verified loss of production due to rain damage. When production from a portion of the acreage within a unit is removed from the vineyard and production from the remaining acreage is lost in the vineyard, the amount of production lost in the vineyard will be determined based on the number of tons of raisins produced on the acreage from which production was removed. When no production has been removed from the vineyard, the amount of production lost in the vineyard will be determined based on an appraisal.</P>
              <P>(3) Insured tonnage will be adjusted as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The insured tonnage will be reduced 0.12 percent for each 0.10 percent of moisture in excess of 16.0 percent. For example, 10.0 tons of raisins containing 18.0 percent moisture will be reduced to 9.760 tons of raisins;</P>
              <P>(ii) Insured tonnage used for dry edible fruit will be reduced by 0.10 percent for each 0.10 percent of substandard raisins in excess of 5.0 percent; and</P>
              <P>(iii) When raisins contain moisture in excess of 24.3 percent at the time of delivery and are released for a use other than dry edible fruit (e.g. distillery material), they will be considered to contain 24.3 percent moisture.</P>
              <P>(4) If any raisins are delivered, the moisture content will be determined at the time of delivery.</P>
              <P>(d) Section 3(c) of the Basic Provisions is not applicable to this crop.</P>

              <P>In lieu of the provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You must report by unit, and on our form, the acreage on which you intend to produce raisins for the crop year. This acreage report must be submitted to us on or before the sales closing date, and contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) All acreage of the crop (insurable and not insurable) in which you will have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) Your anticipated share at the time coverage will begin;</P>
              <P>(3) The variety; and</P>
              <P>(4) The location of each vineyard.</P>
              <P>(b) Acreage of the crop acquired after the acreage was reported, may be included on the acreage report if we agree to accept the additional acreage. Such additional acreage will not be added to the acreage report after you first place raisins from the additional acreage on trays for drying. Failure to report any acreage in which you have a share will result in denial of liability. If you elect not to produce raisins on any part of the acreage included on your acreage report, you must notify us in writing on or before September 21, and provide any records we may require to verify that raisins were not produced on that acreage.</P>

              <P>(c) If you fail to file an acreage report in a timely manner, or if the information reported is incorrect, we may deny liability on any unit.<PRTPAGE P="243"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the acreage report, you must annually submit a tonnage report, on our form, which includes by unit the number of delivered tons of raisins, and, if damage has occurred, the amount of any tonnage we determined was lost due to rain damage in the vineyard for each unit designated in the acreage report.</P>
              <P>(e) The tonnage report must be submitted to us as soon as the information is available, but not later than March 1 of the year following the crop year. Indemnities may be determined on the basis of information you submitted on this report. If you do not submit this report by the reporting date, we may, at our option, either determine the insured tonnage and share by unit or we may deny liability on any unit. This report may be revised only upon our approval. Errors in reporting units may be corrected by us at any time we discover the error.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Annual Premium</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 (Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the annual premium amount is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance for the unit at the time insurance attaches by the premium rate and then multiplying that result by any applicable premium adjustment factors that may apply.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all the raisins in the county of grape varieties for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents and in which you have a share.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the raisins not insurable under section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we do not insure any raisins:</P>
              <P>(1) Laid on trays after September 8 in vineyards with north-south rows in Merced or Stanislaus Counties, or after September 20 in all other counties;</P>
              <P>(2) From table grape strippings; or</P>
              <P>(3) From vines that received manual, mechanical, or chemical treatment to produce table grape sizing.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance attaches on each unit at the time the raisins are placed on trays for drying and ends the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(a) October 20;</P>
              <P>(b) The date the raisins are removed from the trays;</P>
              <P>(c) The date the raisins are removed from the vineyard;</P>
              <P>(d) Total destruction of all raisins on a unit;</P>
              <P>(e) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit; or</P>
              <P>(f) Abandonment of the raisins.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against unavoidable loss of production resulting from rain that occurs during the insurance period and while the raisins are on trays or in rolls in the vineyard for drying.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to inability to market the raisins for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Reconditioning Requirements and Payment</HD>
              <P>(a) We may require you to recondition a representative sample of not more than 10 tons of damaged raisins to determine if they meet standards established by the RAC once reconditioned. If such standards are met, we may require you to recondition all the damaged production. If we determine that it is possible to recondition any damaged production and, if you do not do so, we will value the damaged production at the reference maximum dollar amount, except if your damaged production undergoes a USDA inspection and is stored by your packer with other producer's production to be reconditioned at a later date. If we agree, in writing, that it is not practical to recondition the damaged production, we will determine the number of tons meeting RAC standards that could be obtained if the production were reconditioned.</P>
              <P>(b) If the representative sample of raisins that we require you to recondition does not meet RAC standards for marketable raisins after reconditioning, the reconditioning payment will be the actual cost you incur to recondition the sample, not to exceed an amount that is reasonable and customary for such reconditioning, regardless of the coverage level selected.</P>
              <P>(c) A reconditioning payment, based on the actual (unadjusted) weight of the raisins, will be made if:</P>
              <P>(1) Insured raisin production:</P>
              <P>(i) Is damaged by rain within the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is reconditioned by washing with water and then drying;</P>

              <P>(iii) Is insured at a coverage level greater than that applicable to the catastrophic risk protection plan of insurance; and either<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The damaged production undergoes an inspection by USDA and is found to contain mold, embedded sand, or other rain-caused contamination determined by micro-analysis in excess of standards established by the RAC, or is found to contain moisture in excess of 18 percent; or</P>
              <P>(3) We give you consent to recondition the damaged production.</P>
              <P>(d) Your request for consent to any wash-and-dry reconditioning must identify the acreage on which the production to be reconditioned was damaged in order to be eligible for a reconditioning payment.</P>
              <P>(e) The reconditioning payment for raisins that meet RAC standards for marketable raisins after reconditioning will be the lesser of your actual cost for reconditioning or the amount determined by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the greater of $125.00 or the reconditioning dollar amount per ton contained in the Special Provisions by your coverage level;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result of section 11(e)(1) by the actual number of tons of raisins (unadjusted weight) that are wash-and-dry reconditioned; and</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the result of section 11(e)(2) by your share.</P>
              <P>(f) Only one reconditioning payment will be made for any lot of raisins damaged during the crop year. Multiple reconditioning payments for the same production will not be made.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must give us notice within 72 hours of the time the rain fell on the raisins. We may reject any claim for indemnity if such notice is later. You must provide us the following information when you give us this notice:</P>
              <P>(i) The grape variety;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location of the vineyard and number of acres; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of vines from which the raisins were harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) We will not pay any indemnity unless you:</P>
              <P>(i) Authorize us in writing to obtain all relevant records from any raisin packer, raisin reconditioner, the RAC, or any other person who may have such records. If you fail to meet the requirements of this subsection, all insured production will be considered undamaged and valued at the reference maximum dollar value.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon our request, provide us with records of previous years' production and acreage. This information may be used to establish the amount of insured tonnage when insurable damage results in discarded production.</P>
              <P>(b) In lieu of the provisions in section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8) that require you to submit a claim for indemnity not later than 60 days after the end of the insurance period, any claim for indemnity must be submitted to us not later than March 31 following the date for the end of the insurance period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the acreage from which raisins were removed for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured tonnage of raisins by the reference maximum dollar amount and your coverage level percentage;</P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting from the total in section 13(b)(1) the total value of all insured damaged and undamaged raisins; and</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)(2) by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity, your share will not exceed the lesser of your share at the time insurance attaches or at the time of loss.</P>
              <P>(d) Undamaged raisins or raisins damaged solely by uninsured causes will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.</P>
              <P>(e) Raisins damaged partially by rain and partially by uninsured causes will be valued at the highest prices obtainable, adjusted for any reduction in value due to uninsured causes.</P>
              <P>(f) Raisins that are damaged by rain, but that are reconditioned and meet RAC standards for raisins, will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.</P>
              <P>(g) The value to count for any raisins produced on the unit that are damaged by rain and not removed from the vineyard will be the larger of the appraised salvage value or $35.00 per ton, except that any raisins that are damaged and discarded from trays or are lost from trays scattered in the vineyard as part of normal handling will not be considered to have any value. You must box and deliver any raisins that can be removed from the vineyard.</P>

              <P>(h) At our sole option, we may acquire all the rights and title to your share of any raisins damaged by rain. In such event, the raisins will be valued at zero in determining the amount of loss and we will have the right of ingress and egress to the extent necessary to <PRTPAGE P="245"/>take possession, care for, and remove such raisins.</P>
              <P>(i) Raisins destroyed, put to another use without our consent, or abandoned will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>
              <P>(3) Wildlife;</P>

              <P>(5) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(6) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(7) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to harvest in a timely manner unless harvest is prevented by one of the insurable causes of loss specified in section 11(a); or</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to market the sweet corn unless such failure is due to actual physical damage caused by an insured cause of loss as specified in section 11(a). For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Replanting Payments</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a replanting payment is allowed if, due to an insured cause of loss, more than 25 percent of the plant stand will not produce sweet corn and it is practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by multiplying the per acre replanting payment amount contained in the Special Provisions by your insured share.</P>
              <P>(c) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions, limiting a replanting payment to one each crop year, only one replanting payment will be made for acreage planted during each planting period within the crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements contained in section 14 of the Basic Provisions, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit:</P>
              <P>(a) You also must give us notice not later than 72 hours after the earliest of:</P>
              <P>(1) The time you discontinue harvest of any acreage on the unit;</P>
              <P>(2) The date harvest normally would start if any acreage on the unit will not be harvested; or</P>
              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) If insurance is permitted by the Special Provisions or by written agreement on acreage with production that will be sold by direct marketing, you must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine the value of your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal if you notify us that additional damage has occurred. These appraisals, and/or any acceptable production records provided by you, will be used to determine the value of your production to count.</P>
              <P>(c) Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the dollar amount of insurance (per acre) for the applicable stage if such failure results in our inability to accurately determine the value of production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage in each stage by the amount of insurance per acre for the final stage;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 14(b)(1) by the percentage for the applicable stage (see section 3(e));</P>
              <P>(3) Totalling the results of section 14(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Subtracting either of the following values from the result of section 14(b)(3):</P>
              <P>(i) For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, the total value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of multiplying the total value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)) by fifty-five percent; and</P>

              <P>(5) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(4) by your share.<PRTPAGE P="259"/>

              <P>(a) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land or grown and insured under an organic farming practice, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) You must have provided records, which can be independently verified, of acreage and age of trees for each unit for at least the last crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Dollar Amounts for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) You may select only one dollar amount of insurance for all the macadamia trees in the county in each age group contained in the actuarial table that are insured under this policy. The dollar amount of insurance you choose for each age group must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum dollar amount offered by us for each age group. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum dollar amount of insurance for one age group, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum dollar amount of insurance for all other age groups.</P>
              <P>(2) If the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the original planting pattern, the dollar amount of insurance will be reduced 1 percent for each percent below 90 percent. For example, if the dollar amount of insurance you selected is $2,000 and the stand is 85 percent of the original stand, the dollar amount of insurance on which any indemnity will be based is $1,900 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.95).</P>
              <P>(3) You must report, by the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions, by type if applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the dollar amount of insurance and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(iii) The month and year on which the trees were set out or grafted and the planting pattern;</P>
              <P>(iv) For the first year of insurance following replacement, the month and year of replacement if more than 10 percent of the trees on any unit have been replaced in the previous five crop years; and</P>
              <P>(v) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(A) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(B) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(C) Any other information that we request in order to establish your dollar amount of insurance.</P>
              <P>We will reduce the dollar amount of insurance as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanted perennial crop, removal of trees, damage, change in practices, and any other circumstance that adversely affects the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your dollar amount of insurance from previous levels, we will reduce your dollar amount of insurance as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>
              <P>(b) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), do not apply to macadamia trees.</P>

              <P>(C) Add the results of sections 11(b)(3)(ii)(A) and (B).</P>
              <P>(iii) Subtract the result obtained in section 11(b)(3)(i) from section 11(b)(3)(ii);</P>
              <P>(iv) Divide the result in section 11(b)(3)(iii) by the coverage level you elected (For example, if you elected the 75 percent coverage level and your actual percent of loss was 70 percent, the percent of loss specified in section 11(b)(3) would be calculated as follows: 100%−75% = 25%; 70%−25% = 45%; 45% ÷ 75% = 60%.);</P>

              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You select 65 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the price election on 10 acres of 9-year-old macadamia trees in the unit. Your share is 100 percent. The amount of insurance per acre is $5,850. There are 90 trees per unit. Thirty-five trees are destroyed. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 10 acres × $5,850 = $58,500;</P>
              <P>(3)(i) 100 percent − 65 percent = 35 percent deductible;</P>
              <P>(ii) 35 destroyed trees ÷ 90 total unit trees = 38.9 percent loss;</P>
              <P>(iii) 38.9 percent loss − 35 percent deductible = 3.9 percent;</P>

              <P>(iv) 3.9 percent ÷ 65 percent coverage level = 6.0 percent loss;<PRTPAGE P="263"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) $58,500 total amount of insurance × 6.0 percent loss = $3,510 loss; and</P>
              <P>(5) $3,510 loss × 100 percent share = $3,510 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total amount of loss will include both damaged trees and destroyed trees as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Any orchard with damage, destruction, or combined damage and destruction, that results in a total percent of loss greater than 80 percent due to an insured cause of loss will be considered to be 100 percent damaged and/or destroyed; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any percent of damage by uninsured causes will not be included in the percent of loss.</P>

              <P>Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land or grown and insured under an organic farming practice, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one price election for all the macadamia nuts in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select one price election for each macadamia nut type designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</P>
              <P>(b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), by type if applicable:</P>

              <P>(1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the <PRTPAGE P="264"/>yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>
              <P>(c) The yield used to compute your production guarantee will be determined in accordance with Actual Production History (APH) regulations, 7 CFR part 400, subpart G, and applicable policy provisions unless damage or changes to the orchard or trees require establishment of the yield by another method. In the event of such damage or changes, the yield will be based on our appraisal of the potential of the insured acreage for the crop year.</P>

              <P>(d) Instead of reporting your macadamia nut production for the previous crop year, as required by section 3 of the Basic Provisions, there is a one-year lag period. Each crop year you must report your production from two crop years ago, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> on the 2016 crop year production report, you will provide your 2014 crop year production.</P>

              <P>(6) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:</P>
              <P>(i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective control mechanism is available;</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the macadamia nuts for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we may consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for each type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable (see section 11(c)), by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results in section 11(b)(5) from the results in section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>You select the 65 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the price election on 10 acres of macadamia nuts in the unit. Your share is 100 percent. Your production guarantee (per acre) is 4,000 pounds. The price election is $0.78. You are able to harvest 25,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 10 acres × 4,000 pounds = 40,000 pounds guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 40,000 pounds × $0.78 price election = $31,200 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 25,000 pounds production to count × $0.78 price election = $19,500 value of production to count;</P>

              <P>(6) $31,200 total value of guarantee − $19,500 value of production to count = $11,700 loss; and<PRTPAGE P="266"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) $11,700 loss × 100 percent share = $11,700 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (wet in-shell pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Cause of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:</P>

We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general to the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) Harvested production which, due to insurable causes, is determined not to meet the United States Standards for Fresh Cranberries if available, or would not meet those standards if properly handled, or does not meet the quality requirements of the receiving handler if the United States Standards for Fresh Cranberries, if not available, and such harvested production has a value less than 75 percent of the market price for cranberries meeting the minimum requirements will be adjusted by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the value per barrel of such cranberries by the market price per barrel for cranberries meeting the minimum requirements; and</P>

              <P>(3) After the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 11(c) due to uninsured causes when determining any indemnity. We may reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees.</P>
              <P>(d) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.</P>

For each subsequent crop year the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>

              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of prunes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year and if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>

              <P>(7) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures; or</P>
              <P>(8) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to inability to market the prunes for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples in accordance with our procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing or sold as fresh fruit. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing or is sold as fresh fruit production. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing or sold as fresh fruit will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>

              <P>(3) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged production.<PRTPAGE P="271"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result of 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for each type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 11(c)), of each type, if applicable, by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and</P>

              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>You select 75 percent coverage level, 100 percent of the price election, and have a 100 percent share in 50.0 acres of type A prunes in the unit. The production guarantee is 2.5 tons per acre and your price election is $630.00 per ton. You harvest 10.0 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) 50.0 acres × 2.5 tons = 125.0-ton production guarantee;</P>
                <P>(2) 125.0-ton guarantee × $630.00 price election = $78,750 value of production guarantee;</P>

The production guarantee is 2.0 tons per acre and the price election is $550.00 per ton. You harvest 5.0 tons. Your total indemnity for both types A and B would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) 50.0 acres × 2.5 tons = 125.0-ton production guarantee for type A and 50.0 acres × 2.0 tons = 100.0-ton production guarantee for type B;</P>
                <P>(2) 125.0-ton guarantee × $630.00 price election = $78,750 value of production guarantee for type A and 100.0-ton guarantee × $550.00 price election = $55,000 value production guarantee for type B;</P>
                <P>(3) $78,750 + $55,000 = $133,750 total value of production guarantee;</P>
                <P>(4) 10.0 tons × $630.00 price election = $6,300 value of production to count for type A and 5.0 tons × $550.00 price election = $2,750 value of production to count for type B;</P>

              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the peanuts in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That are planted for the purpose of marketing as farmers' stock peanuts;</P>
              <P>(3) That are a type of peanut designated in the Special Provisions as being insurable;</P>
              <P>(4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):</P>
              <P>(i) Planted for the purpose of harvesting as green peanuts;</P>
              <P>(ii) Interplanted with another crop; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Planted into an established grass or legume; and</P>
              <P>(5) Whether or not the peanuts are grown in accordance with a sheller contract (if not grown in accordance with the sheller contract, the peanuts will be valued at the price election issued by FCIC for the purposes of determining the production guarantee, premium, and indemnity).</P>
              <P>(b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, under the sheller contract, you retain control of the acreage on which the peanuts are grown, you are at risk of a production loss, and the sheller contract provides for delivery of the peanuts to the sheller or handler and for a stipulated base contract price.</P>
              <P>(c) A peanut producer who is also a sheller or handler may establish an insurable interest if the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The producer must comply with these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or officers of the sheller or handler must execute and adopt a resolution that contains the same terms as a sheller contract. Such resolution will be considered a sheller contract under this policy; and</P>
              <P>(3) Our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply with the definition of a sheller contained in these Crop Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:</P>

              <P>(a) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would normally not further care for the <PRTPAGE P="274"/>crop, must be replanted unless we agree that replanting is not practical.</P>
              <P>(b) We will not insure any acreage:</P>
              <P>(1) On which peanuts are grown using no-till or minimum tillage farming methods unless allowed by the Special Provisions or written agreement; or</P>
              <P>(2) Which does not meet the rotation requirements, if any, contained in the Special Provisions.</P>

              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the date immediately following planting as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) November 30 in all states except New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and</P>
              <P>(b) December 31 in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(a) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(b) Fire;</P>
              <P>(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(e) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(f) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(g) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in section 11(a) through (g) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Replanting Payments</HD>
              <P>(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Except as specified in section 12(a)(1), you must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions; and</P>
              <P>(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) 20.0 percent of the production guarantee, multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your share; or</P>
              <P>(2) $80.00 multiplied by your insured share.</P>
              <P>(c) If there are different base contract prices or you also have insurable peanuts not grown under a contract:</P>
              <P>(1) If the sheller contracts are for different types of peanuts or one type of peanut is grown under a sheller contract and another is not, replanting payments will be valued using the price election elected by you for the planted acreage, as applicable (For an example, you have two sheller contracts and the base contract price is $0.23 per pound for Runner type peanuts, then $0.23 per pound will be used for the value of any replanted Runner type peanut acreage. If the base contract price is $0.21 per pound for Spanish type peanuts, then $0.21 per pound will be used for the value of any replanted Spanish type peanut acreage.</P>
              <P>(2) If the sheller contracts are for the same type of peanuts but they have different base contract prices:</P>
              <P>(i) If the peanuts under each sheller contract are insured in separate optional units, each respective price election from each sheller contract will apply to each respective unit; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If all or some of peanuts under both sheller contracts are insured in the same unit, then the replanted acreage will be prorated to each contract based on the number of acres needed to fulfill each contract (For example, if there are 20 acres in the unit and 10 were replanted, the production guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, and the contract for $0.23 was for 25,000 pounds and the contract for $0.21 was for 15,000 pounds, then the acreage under the $0.23 contract constitutes 62.5 percent of the acreage in the unit (25,000/40,000) and the other sheller contract 37.5 percent of the acreage (15,000/40,000). Of the 10 acres replanted, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid at the $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) would be paid at the $0.21 price election).</P>

              <P>(3) If the peanuts are not grown under a contract, the replanting payments will be valued using the price election as specified in the Special Provisions. If the unit has peanuts grown under a sheller contract and peanuts not grown under a sheller contract, the replanted acreage must be prorated between the contract and non-contract acreage by determining the acreage grown under a contract and the remaining acreage in the unit (For example, if there are 20 acres in the unit and 10 were replanted, the production guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, there is a sheller contract for $0.23 for 25,000 pounds, the remaining peanuts are not grown under a sheller contract, and the price election in the Special Provisions is for $0.20. The peanuts under the sheller contract constitute 62.5 percent (25,000/40,000) of the acreage in the unit and remaining peanuts constitute 37.5 percent (40,000−25,000/40,000) of <PRTPAGE P="275"/>the acreage. Of the 10 acres replanted, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid with the liability based on the $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) would be paid with the liability based on the $0.20 price election).</P>
              <P>(d) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(e) Replanting payments will be calculated using your price election and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and insured. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type, if applicable.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability for the harvested acreage for the unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by the respective production guarantee (per acre) for peanuts insured under a sheller contract or not insured under a sheller contract, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 14(b)(1) by the applicable price election for peanuts insured at the base contract price or the price election specified in the Special Provisions, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the production to count by the respective price election (If you have one or more sheller contracts, we will value your production to count by using your highest price election first and will continue in decreasing order to your lowest price election based on the amount of peanuts insured at each price election);</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 14(b)(5) from the result of section 14(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 14(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>Example #1 (without a sheller contract):</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 25 acres of Valencia peanuts in the unit, with a production guarantee (per acre) of 2,000 pounds, the price election specified in the Special Provisions is $0.17 per pound, and your production to count is 43,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>(1) 25 acres × 2,000 pounds = 50,000 pound guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 50,000 pound guarantee × $0.17 price election specified in the Special Provisions = $8,500.00 guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 43,000 pounds of production to count × $0.17 price election specified in the Special Provisions = $7,310.00;</P>
              <P>(4) $8,500.00 guarantee−$7,310.00 = $1,190.00; and</P>
              <P>(5) $1,190.00 × 1.000 = $1,190.00; Indemnity = $1,190.00.</P>
              <P>Example #2 (with a sheller contract):</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 25 acres of Valencia peanuts in the unit, with a production guarantee (per acre) of 2,000 pounds. You have two sheller contracts, the first is for 25,000 pounds, price election (contract) is $0.23 per pound, and the second is for 10,000 pounds, price election (contract) is $0.21 per pound. The price election (non-contract) specified in the Special Provisions is $0.17 per pound, and your production to count is 43,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>(1) 25 acres × 2,000 pounds = 50,000 pound guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 25,000 pounds contracted × $0.23 price election (contract) = $5,750.00;</P>
              <P>10,000 pounds contracted × $0.21 price election (contract) = $2,100.00;</P>
              <P>50,000 pound guarantee−25,000 pounds contracted−10,000 pounds contracted = 15,000 pounds not contracted;</P>
              <P>15,000 pounds not contracted × $0.17 price election (non-contract) specified in the Special Provisions = $2,550.00;</P>
              <P>(3) $5,750.00 + $2,100.00 + $2,550.00 = $10,400.00 guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 43,000 pounds of production to count:</P>
              <P>25,000 pounds contracted × $0.23 price election (contract) = $5,750.00;</P>
              <P>10,000 pounds contracted × $0.21 price election (contract) = $2,100.00;</P>
              <P>43,000 pounds of production to count−25,000 pounds contracted (at $0.23 per pound)−10,000 pounds contracted (at $0.21 per pound) = 8,000 pounds;</P>
              <P>8,000 pounds × $0.17 price election (non-contract) specified in the Special Provisions = $1,360.00;</P>
              <P>(5) $5,750.00 + $2,100.00 + $1,360.00 = $9,210.00;</P>
              <P>(6) $10,400.00 guarantee−$9,210.00 = $1,190.00; and</P>
              <P>(7) $1,190.00 × 1.000 = $1,190.00;</P>
              <P>Indemnity = $1,190.00.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include all appraised and harvested production.</P>
              <P>(d) All appraised production will include:</P>
              <P>(1) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(i) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(ii) Put to another use without our consent;<PRTPAGE P="276"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(iv) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.</P>
              <P>(2) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(3) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 14(e));</P>
              <P>(4) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for the acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(i) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(ii) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(5) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(e) Mature peanuts may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by an insured cause of loss.</P>
              <P>(1) To enable us to determine the number of pounds, price per pound, and the quality of production for any peanuts that qualify for quality adjustment, we must be given the opportunity to have such peanuts inspected and graded before you dispose of them.</P>
              <P>(2) If you dispose of any production without giving us the opportunity to have the peanuts inspected and graded, the gross weight of such production will be used in determining total production to count unless you submit a marketing record satisfactory to us which clearly shows the number of pounds, price per pound, and quality of such peanuts.</P>
              <P>(3) Such production to count will be reduced if the price per pound received for damaged peanuts is less than 85 percent of the price election by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the price per pound for the damaged peanuts, as determined by us in accordance with section 14(e)(1), received for the insured type of peanuts by the applicable price election; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying this result by the number of pounds of such production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">15. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>(a) Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 17(i) of the Basic Provisions, if there are different base contract prices or you also have insurable peanuts not grown under a contract:</P>
              <P>(1) If the sheller contracts are for different types of peanuts or one type of peanut is grown under a sheller contract and another is not, the liability will be determined using the price election elected by you for planted acreage, as applicable (For an example, you have two sheller contracts and the base contract price is $0.23 per pound for Runner type peanuts, then $0.23 per pound will be used for the value of any prevented planting Runner type peanut acreage. If the base contract price is $0.21 per pound for Spanish type peanuts, then $0.21 per pound will be used for the value of any prevented planting Spanish type peanut acreage.</P>
              <P>(2) If the sheller contracts are for the same type of peanuts but they have different base contract prices:</P>
              <P>(i) If the peanuts grown under each sheller contract are insured in separate optional units, the liability will be determined using each respective price election for the prevented planting acreage in each respective unit; or</P>

              <P>(ii) If all or some of the peanuts grown under the sheller contracts are insured in the same unit, then the liability for each contract must be determined separately using the respective price election and the number of eligible prevented planting acres to which the liability applies and will be determined by prorating prevented planting acreage to each contract based on the number of acres needed to fulfill each contract (For example, if there are 20 acres in the unit and 10 were prevented from planting, the production guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, and the contract for $0.23 was for 25,000 pounds and the contract for $0.21 was for 15,000 pounds, then the acreage under the $0.23 contract constitutes 62.5 percent (25,000/40,000) of the acreage in the unit and the other contract 37.5 percent (15,000/40,000) of the acreage. Of the 10 acres prevented from planting, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid with the liability based on the $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) <PRTPAGE P="277"/>would be paid with the liability based on the $0.21 price election).</P>
              <P>(3) If the peanuts are not grown under a contract, the liability for such peanuts will be based on the price election as specified in the Special Provisions. If the unit has peanuts grown under a sheller contract and peanuts not grown under a sheller contract, the eligible prevented planting acreage must be determined by determining the acreage grown under a contract and the remaining acreage in the unit (For example, if there are 20 acres in the unit and 10 were prevented from planting, the production guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, there is a sheller contract for $0.23 for 25,000 pounds, the remaining peanuts are not grown under a sheller contract, and the price election in the Special Provisions is for $0.20. The peanuts under the sheller contract constitute 62.5 percent (25,000/40,000) of the acreage in the unit and remaining peanuts constitute 37.5 percent (40,000−25,000/40,000) of the acreage. Of the 10 acres prevented from planting, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid with the liability based on the $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) would be paid with the liability based on the $0.20 price election).</P>

              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against as listed in section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure <PRTPAGE P="280"/>against any loss of production due to damage that occurs or becomes evident after the end of the insurance period, including, but not limited to, loss of production that occurs after onions have been placed in storage.</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the final stage production guarantee for the acreage and we determine that it is practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be your actual cost for replanting, but will not exceed the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) 7 percent of the final stage production guarantee multiplied by your price election for the type originally planted and by your insured share; or</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, any representative samples of the crop that may be required must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be topped, lifted, dug, harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.</P>
              <P>(b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count that is not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 14(b)(1) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 14(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted (see section 14(c)) by the respective price elections you chose;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 14(b)(5) from the result in 14(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 14(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For Example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of a unit of transplanted storage onions with a production guarantee of 200 hundredweight per acre, and you select 100 percent of the price election of $8.00 per hundredweight. Your crop suffers a covered cause of loss on 25 acres during the second stage which has a second stage production guarantee of 60 percent of the final stage production guarantee which equals 120 hundredweight per acre. The appraised production on the 25 acres was 2,500 hundredweight of onion production. Your harvested onion production on the remaining 75 acres is 16,000 hundredweight of harvested production to count. Your indemnity will be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 25 acres × 120 hundredweight (200 × .60) second stage production guarantee = 3,000 hundredweight, and 75 acres × 200 hundredweight final stage production guarantee = 15,000 hundredweight;</P>
              <P>(2) 3,000 hundredweight second stage production guarantee × $8.00 price election = $24,000 value of second stage production guarantee, and 15,000 hundredweight final stage production guarantee × $8.00 price election = $120,000 value of final stage production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) $24,000 value of second stage production guarantee + $120,000 value of final stage production guarantee = $144,000 total value of production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 500 hundredweight second stage production to count (from step 4 of the section 14(c)(1)(iv) example) × $8.00 price election = $4,000 value of second stage production to count, and 16,000 hundredweight final stage production to count × 8.00 price election = $128,000 value of final stage production to count;</P>
              <P>(5) $4,000 value of second stage production to count + $128,000 value of final stage production to count = $132,000 total value of production to count;</P>

              <P>(6) $144,000 total value of production guarantee −$132,000 total value of production to count = $12,000 value of loss; and<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) $12,000 × 100 percent share = $12,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production (in hundredweight) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is direct marketed to consumers if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 13;</P>
              <P>(C) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(D) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(E) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested onion production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted based on the percent of damaged onion production in accordance with section 14(d));</P>
              <P>(iv) For acreage that does not qualify for the final stage production guarantee, and is not subject to section 14 (c)(1)(i) and (ii), the appraised production is reduced by the difference between the first or second stage (as applicable) and the final stage production guarantee; and</P>
              <P>For Example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 acres of a unit of transplanted storage onions with a production guarantee of 200 hundredweight per acre. Your crop suffers a covered cause of loss on 25 acres during the second stage which has a second stage production guarantee of 60 percent of the final stage production guarantee. The appraised production on the 25 acres was 2,500 hundredweight of onion production. Your second stage production to count on the 25 acres will be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 25 acres × 200 hundredweight final stage production guarantee = 5,000 hundredweight final stage production guarantee,</P>
              <P>(2) 5,000 hundredweight final stage production guarantee × 60 percent second stage production guarantee = 3,000 hundredweight second stage production guarantee,</P>
              <P>(3) 5,000 hundredweight final stage production guarantee −3,000 hundredweight second stage production guarantee = 2,000 hundredweight difference between second stage and final stage production guarantee, and</P>
              <P>(4) 2,500 hundredweight appraised −2,000 hundredweight difference = 500 hundredweight second stage production to count (for step 4 of the section 14(b) example).</P>
              <P>(v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop.</P>
              <P>(vi) If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested onion production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested onion production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested onion production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) If the damage to harvested or unharvested onion production exceeds the percentage shown in the Special Provisions for the type, no production will be counted for that unit or portion of a unit unless such damaged onion production from that acreage is sold.

              <P>(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss specified in sections 10(a) through (g) that also occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss.</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must maintain representative samples of each unharvested tobacco crop (type) for our inspection. The representative samples must be at least 5 feet wide (at least two rows), and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until after our inspection.</P>
              <P>(b) If you have filed a notice of damage, you must leave all tobacco stalks and stubble in the unit intact for our inspection. The stalks and stubble must not be destroyed until we give you written consent to do so or until 30 days after the end of the insurance period, whichever is earlier.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim.</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by your applicable production guarantee (per acre);</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(1) by your price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the total production to count determined in section 12(c) by your price election;</P>
              <P>(4) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(3) from the result of section 12(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(5) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(4) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in a unit to produce 3,000 pounds of Burley tobacco, a production guarantee of 1,950 pounds (APH yield of 3,000 pounds × .65 coverage level), you plant 1.0 acre, your price election is $1.50 per pound, and your production to count is 500 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 1.0 acre × 1,950 pounds production guarantee = 1,950 pounds;</P>
              <P>(2) 1,950 pounds × $1.50 price election = $2,925.00 value of the production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 500 pounds production to count × $1.50 price election = $750.00 value of the production to count;</P>
              <P>(4) $2,925.00 value of the production guarantee—$750.00 value of the production to count = $2,175.00; and</P>
              <P>(5) $2,175.00 × 1.000 share = $2,175.00 indemnity.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide records of production, that are acceptable to us; or</P>
              <P>(E) For any type of tobacco when the stalks and stubble have been destroyed without our consent under section 11(b);</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.</P>

              <P>(iii) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use <PRTPAGE P="284"/>or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Once we agree the current year's tobacco has no average value due to an insured cause of loss, you must destroy it, and it will not be considered production to count. If you refuse to destroy such tobacco, we will include it as production to count and value it at the applicable price election.</P>
              <P>(e) In lieu of section 15(b) of the Basic Provisions, if we have conducted an appraisal of your insured crop and we determine that the harvested production you report is inconsistent with the appraised production and you cannot prove that an insurable cause of loss occurred between the appraisal and the end of the insurance period that can account for the reduction in production, your claim will be settled based on the appraised production on insured acreage, even if you have harvested the acreage. If we settle your claim based on your appraised production, section 12(f) regarding quality adjustment is not applicable.</P>
              <P>(f) Mature tobacco may be adjusted for quality deficiencies when production has been damaged by insurable causes.</P>
              <P>(1) You must contact us before any tobacco is disposed of so we can inspect the tobacco to determine the extent of the damage.</P>
              <P>(2) Our inspection will be used to determine whether the average value is reasonable. Based on amount of damage determined during the inspection, if the average value is:</P>
              <P>(i) Reasonable, such average value will be used to determine the quality adjustment in section 12(f)(5);</P>
              <P>(ii) Unreasonable, we may adjust the average value used to calculate the quality adjustment in section 12(f)(5).</P>
              <P>(3) If you dispose of any production without giving us the opportunity to have the tobacco inspected, you will not receive a quality adjustment for such tobacco, regardless of the average value of the production.</P>
              <P>(4) Production to count will only be reduced if the average value for damaged tobacco is less than 75 percent of your tobacco price election. You must provide us with records that are acceptable to us which clearly shows the number of pounds, price per pound, and the quality of such tobacco.</P>
              <P>(5) Any reduction in the production to count will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the average value per pound as determined by us in accordance with section 12(f)(2) of these Crop Provisions by your applicable price election; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying this result by the number of pounds of damaged production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>In lieu of late planting provisions in the Basic Provisions regarding acreage initially planted after the final planting date, insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) The production guarantee (per acre) for acreage planted during the late planting period will be reduced by:</P>
              <P>(1) One percent per day for the 1st through the 10th day; and</P>
              <P>(2) Two percent per day for the 11th through the 15th day;</P>
              <P>(b) The premium amount for insurable acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for acreage planted after the final planting date exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. Additional prevented planting coverage levels are not available for tobacco.</P>

              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Excessive moisture that prevents harvesting equipment from entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting equipment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease but only on acreage not planted to peas the previous crop year. (In certain instances, contained in the Special Provisions or in a written agreement, acreage planted to peas the previous year may be covered. Damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures is not covered);</P>
              <P>(5) Wildlife;</P>

              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in section 10(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Bypassed acreage because of:</P>
              <P>(i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment or;</P>
              <P>(2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the processor contract.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the notices required by section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must give us notice:</P>
              <P>(a) Not later than 48 hours after:</P>
              <P>(1) Total destruction of the green peas on the unit; or</P>
              <P>(2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested production remains.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after notice is given to us;</P>
              <P>(c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest, so that we may inspect any damaged production. If you fail to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count. You are not required to delay harvest; and</P>
              <P>(d) Prior to the time the green peas would normally be harvested if you intend to harvest the green peas as dry peas.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>

              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:<PRTPAGE P="288"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more than one type; and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of shell type green peas in the unit, with a guarantee of 4,000 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.09 per pound. You are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 400,000 pounds × $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 200,000 pounds × $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $36,000.00 − $18,000.00 = $18,000.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $18,000.00 × 100 percent = $18,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of pod type green peas in the same unit, with a guarantee of 5,000 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.13 per pound. You are only able to harvest 450,000 pounds. Your total indemnity for both shell type and pod type green peas would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee for the shell type, and 100 acres × 5,000 pounds = 500,000 pounds guarantee for the pod type;</P>
              <P>(2) 400,000 pounds guarantee × $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 value of guarantee for the shell type, and 500,000 pounds guarantee × $0.13 price election = $65,000.00 value of guarantee for the pod type;</P>
              <P>(3) $36,000.00 + $65,000.00 = $101,000.00 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 200,000 pounds × $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of production to count for the shell type, and</P>
              <P>450,000 pounds × $0.13 = $58,500.00 value of production to count for the pod type;</P>
              <P>(5) $18,000.00 + $58,500.00 = $76,500.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $101,000.00 − $76,500.00 = $24,500.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $24,500.00 loss × 100 percent = $24,500.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count, specified in pounds, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes or;</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.</P>
              <P>(iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract.</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested.</P>

              <P>(2) All harvested green pea production from the insurable acreage. The amount of such production will be determined by dividing the dollar amount paid, payable, or which should have been paid under the terms of the <PRTPAGE P="289"/>processor contract for the quality and quantity of the peas delivered to the processor by the base contract price per pound;</P>
              <P>(3) All harvested green pea production from any of your other insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract for this unit; and</P>
              <P>(4) All dry pea production from the insurable acreage if you gave notice in accordance with section 11(d) for any acreage you intended to harvest as dry peas. The harvested or appraised dry pea production will be multiplied by 1.667 for shell types and 3.000 for pod types to determine the green pea production equivalent. No adjustment for quality deficiencies will be allowed for dry pea production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>A late planting period is not applicable to green peas unless allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written approval from the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will accept the production from the late planted acres when it is expected to be ready for harvest.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(1) Is located on non-contiguous land; or</P>
              <P>(2) Consists of a separate type when separate types are specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) In Arizona and California, you may select only one coverage level and price election for each grape variety you elect to insure in the county.</P>

              <P>(b) In all states except Arizona and California, you may select only one coverage level and price election for each grape type in the county as specified in the Special Provisions. The coverage level you choose for each grape type is not required to have the same percentage relationship. The price election you choose for each type is not required <PRTPAGE P="290"/>to have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 75 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 65 percent coverage level and 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type. If you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of insurance for any grape type, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured grape acreage in the county.</P>
              <P>(c) In all states except Arizona and California, if you acquire a share in any grape acreage after you submit your application, such acreage is insurable under the terms of the policy and you did not include the grape type on your application, we will assign the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A coverage level equal to the lowest coverage level you selected for any other grape type: and</P>
              <P>(2) A price election percentage equal to the type with the lowest coverage level you selected, if you elected additional coverage; or 55 percent of the maximum price election, if you elected CAT.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the definition of “price election” contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, a price election based on the price contained in your grape contract is allowed if provided by the Special Provisions. In the event any contract requires the use of a cultural practice that will reduce the amount of production from any insured acreage, your approved yield will be adjusted in accordance with section 3(f) and (g) to reflect the reduced production potential.</P>
              <P>(e) In Arizona and California only, if the Special Provisions do not provide a price election for a specific variety you wish to insure, you may apply for a written agreement to establish a price election. Your application for the written agreement must include:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of tons sold for at least the two most recent crop years; and</P>
              <P>(2) The price received for all production of the grape variety in the years for which production records are provided.</P>
              <P>(f) You must report by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type or variety, if applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Any damage, removal of bearing vines, change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing vines on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the vines and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and the grape type or variety, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(g) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, based on our estimate of the effect on yield potential of any of the items listed in section 3(f)(1) through (4). If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>
              <P>(h) Your request to increase the coverage level or price election percentage will not be accepted if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop is evident when your request is made.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation date for Arizona and California and August 31 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Report of Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must report your acreage:</P>
              <P>(a) In Arizona and California, by each grape variety you insure; or</P>
              <P>(b) In all other states, by each grape type.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be any insurable variety that you elect to insure in Arizona and California, or in all other states all insurable types, in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(a) In which you have a share;</P>

              <P>(b) That are grown for wine, juice, raisins, or canning (if such grapes are put to another use (<E T="03">i.e.</E> table grapes), the production to count will be in accordance with section 12(c)(2(ii));</P>
              <P>(c) That are grown in a vineyard that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us;</P>
              <P>(d) That, after being set out or grafted, have reached the number of growing seasons designated by the Special Provisions; and</P>

              <P>(e) That have produced an average of at least two tons of grapes per acre (or as otherwise provided in the Special Provisions) in at <PRTPAGE P="291"/>least one of the three crop years immediately preceding the insured crop year, unless we inspect and allow insurance on acreage that has not produced this amount.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, grapes interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) For the year of application, coverage begins on February 1 in Arizona and California, and November 21 in all other states. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if your application is received by us after January 12 but prior to February 1 in Arizona or California, or after November 1 but prior to November 21 in all other states, insurance will attach on the 20th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 20-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the vineyard.</P>
              <P>(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(3) If in accordance with the terms of the policy, your grape policy is cancelled or terminated for any crop year after insurance attached for that crop year, but on or before the cancellation and termination dates, whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <P>(4) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is as follows, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) October 10 in Mississippi and Texas;</P>
              <P>(ii) November 10 in Arizona, California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington; and</P>
              <P>(iii) November 20 in all other states.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of grapes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the vineyard;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, except as excluded in 10(b)(1), but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(6) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Phylloxera, regardless of cause; or</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the grapes for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>

              <P>(a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If the crop has been damaged during the growing season and you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), you must also provide notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity as a result of the damage previously reported. You must not destroy the damaged crop that is marketed in normal commercial channels, until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election you selected for each type or variety;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count of each type or variety, if applicable, (see section 12 (c) through (e)) by the respective price election you selected;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 12(b)(5) from the result in section 12(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned or destroyed by you without our consent;</P>
              <P>(B) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(C) For which you fail to provide production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with subsection 12 (e)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage:</P>
              <P>(i) Grape production that is harvested and dried for raisins will be converted to a fresh weight basis by multiplying the number of tons of raisin production by 4.5.</P>
              <P>(ii) Grapes grown for wine, juice, raisins or canning and put to another use, will be counted as production to count on a tonnage basis. No quality adjustment other than that specifically provided for in your policy is available.</P>
              <P>(d) If any grapes are harvested before normal maturity or for a special use (such as Champagne or Botrytis-affected grapes), the production of such grapes will be increased by the factor obtained by dividing the price per ton received for such grapes by the price per ton for fully matured grapes of the type for which the claim is being made.</P>
              <P>(e) Mature marketable grape production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if, due to insurable causes, it has a value of less than 75 percent of the average market price of undamaged grapes of the same or similar variety. The value per ton of the qualifying damaged production and the average market price of undamaged grapes will be determined on the earlier of the date the damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The average market price of undamaged production will be calculated by averaging the prices being paid by usual marketing outlets for the area during the week in which the damaged grapes were valued.</P>
              <P>(2) Grape production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in subsection 12(e)(1) will be reduced by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the value per ton of the damaged grapes by the value per ton for undamaged grapes (the value of undamaged grapes will be the lesser of the average market price or the maximum price election for such grapes); and</P>

              <P>(ii) Multiplying this result (not to exceed 1.000) by the number of tons of the eligible damaged grapes.<PRTPAGE P="293"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Unit Division</HD>

              <P>In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage as provided in the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, separate optional units <PRTPAGE P="299"/>may be established for each dry pea type as specified on the Special Provisions. Contract seed peas and dry pea types not grown under a processor/seed company contract may qualify for separate optional units even if they share a common variety provided each dry pea type is grown on separate acreage and the production is kept separate.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 3(b) of the Basic Provisions, you may select only one coverage level for each type listed on the Special Provisions. However, if you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of insurance for any dry pea type, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured dry pea acreage in the county.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Special Provisions do not designate separate price elections by type, you may select only one price election for all dry peas in the county insured under this policy.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Special Provisions designate separate price elections by type, you may select one price election for each dry pea type so designated in the Special Provisions even if the prices for each type are the same. The price elections you choose for each type are not required to have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, in counties with both a fall and spring sales closing date for the insured crop:</P>
              <P>(1) If you do not have any insured fall-planted dry pea acreage covered under the Winter Coverage Option, you may change your coverage level or percentage of price election until the spring sales closing date; or</P>
              <P>(2) If you have any insured fall-planted dry pea acreage covered under the Winter Coverage Option, you may not change your coverage level or percentage of price election after the fall sales closing date.</P>
              <P>(d) If a dry pea type is added after the sales closing date, we will assign:</P>
              <P>(1) A coverage level equal to the lowest coverage level you selected for any other dry pea types; and</P>
              <P>(2) A price election percentage equal to:</P>
              <P>(i) 100 percent of the price election if you elected additional coverage; and</P>
              <P>(ii) 55 percent of the price election if you elected catastrophic level of coverage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are March 15.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Report of Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must submit a copy of the processor/seed company contract to us on or before the acreage reporting date if you are insuring contract seed peas.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the dry pea types in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That are planted for harvesting once maturity is reached as:</P>
              <P>(i) Dry peas; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Contract seed peas, if the processor/seed company contract is executed on or before the acreage reporting; and</P>
              <P>(3) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):</P>
              <P>(i) Interplanted with another crop;</P>
              <P>(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume;</P>
              <P>(iii) Planted as a nurse crop; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Planted to plow down, graze, harvest as hay, or otherwise not harvest as a mature dry pea crop.</P>
              <P>(b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, under the processor/seed company contract, you retain control of the acreage on which the dry peas are grown, you are at risk of loss (i.e., if there is a reduction in quantity or quality of your dry pea production, you will receive less income under the contract), and the processor/seed company contract is in effect for the entire insurance period.</P>
              <P>(c) In counties for which the actuarial documents provide premium rates for the Winter Coverage Option (see section 15), coverage is available for dry peas between the time coverage begins and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the option is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the option and you elect the option by the sales closing date.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:</P>

              <P>(a) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation requirements, if <PRTPAGE P="300"/>applicable, contained in the Special Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that producers in the surrounding area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates:</P>
              <P>(1) Any fall-planted dry peas that is damaged before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a fall-planted type of dry peas to maintain insurance based on the fall-planted type unless we agree that replanting is not practical. If it is not practical to replant to a fall-planted type of dry peas but it is practical to replant to a spring-planted type, you must replant to a spring-planted type to keep your insurance coverage based on the fall-planted type in force.</P>
              <P>(2) Any fall-planted dry pea acreage that is replanted to a spring-planted type when it was practical to replant the fall-planted type will be insured as the spring-planted type and the production guarantee, premium and price election applicable to the spring-planted type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be considered to be initially planted to the spring-planted type.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding section 8(d)(1) and (2), if you have elected coverage under the Winter Coverage Option (if available in the county), insurance will be in accordance with the option.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of a fall-planted dry pea crop is not insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we agree in writing that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee.</P>
              <P>(1) The fall-planted dry pea crop will be insured as a spring-planted type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium and price election.</P>
              <P>(2) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand prior to the spring final planting date.</P>
              <P>(3) Any acreage of such fall-planted dry peas that is damaged after it is accepted for insurance but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring-planted type of dry pea unless we agree it is not practical to replant. No replanting payment will be made.</P>
              <P>(4) If fall-planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as uninsured fall-planted acreage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>9. Insurance Period.</P>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, and subject to the provisions provided by the Winter Coverage Option (see section 15) if you elect such option, the insurance period is as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Coverage for fall-planted dry peas not covered by the Winter Coverage Option will begin on the earlier of April 15 or the date we agree to accept the acreage for insurance, but not before March 1, unless otherwise specified on the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for all insurable types of dry peas in the county is September 30 of the crop year in which the crop is normally harvested unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(a) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(b) Fire;</P>
              <P>(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(e) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(f) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(g) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in section 10(a) through (g) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Replanting Payments</HD>
              <P>(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) You must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions (except as allowed in section 11(a)(1)) and in the Winter Coverage Option (see section 15), if applicable;</P>

              <P>(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage;<PRTPAGE P="301"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The acreage must have been initially planted to a spring type of the insured crop in those counties with only a spring final planting date;</P>
              <P>(5) When the Winter Coverage Option is in effect for the acreage, damage must occur after the fall final planting date in those counties where both a fall and spring final planting date are designated;</P>
              <P>(6) Replanting payments are not available for damaged fall planted dry pea acreage if you have not elected to cover such acreage under the Winter Coverage Option; and</P>
              <P>(7) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that will produce at least the yield used to determine your production guarantee.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20.0 percent of the production guarantee or 200 pounds, multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your share, unless otherwise stated in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(d) Replanting payments will be calculated using the price election and production guarantee for the dry pea type that is replanted and insured. For example, if damaged smooth green and yellow pea acreage is replanted to lentils, the price election and production guarantee applicable to lentils will be used to calculate any replanting payment that may be due. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the following will have a replanting payment based on the guarantee and price election for the crop type initially planted:</P>
              <P>(1) Any damaged fall-planted type of dry peas replanted to a spring-planted type that retains insurance based on the production guarantee and price election for the fall-planted type; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any acreage replanted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of the insured crop.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional units, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage to your dry pea crop covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage of each dry pea type, if applicable, excluding contract seed peas, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 13(b)(1) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the insured acreage of each contract seed pea variety by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(5) Multiplying each result of section 13(b)(4) by the applicable base contract price;</P>
              <P>(6) Multiplying each result of section 13(b)(5) by your selected price election percentage;</P>
              <P>(7) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(6);</P>
              <P>(8) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(3) and section 13(b)(7);</P>
              <P>(9) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each dry pea type, excluding contract seed peas, if applicable (see section 13(d)), by the respective price elections;</P>
              <P>(10) Totaling the value of all contract seed pea production (see section 13(c));</P>
              <P>(11) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(9) and section 13(b)(10);</P>
              <P>(12) Subtracting the result of section 13(b)(11) from the result in section 12(b)(8); and</P>
              <P>(13) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)12 by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>In this example, you have not elected optional units by type. You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of spring-planted smooth green dry edible peas in the unit, with a 70 percent guarantee of 4,000 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.09 per pound. Your selected price election percentage is 100 percent. You are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 4,000 pounds = 400,000-pound guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 400,000-pound guarantee × $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(9) 200,000-pound production to count × $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(12) $36,000.00 value of guarantee − $18,000.00 value of production to count = $18,000.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(13) $18,000.00 × 100 percent share = $18,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>

              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of contract seed peas in the same unit, with a 65 percent guarantee of 5,000 pounds per acre and a base contract price of $0.40 per <PRTPAGE P="302"/>pound. Your selected price election percentage is 75 percent. You are only able to harvest 450,000 pounds. Your total indemnity for both spring-planted smooth green dry edible peas and contract seed peas would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 4,000 pounds = 400,000-pound guarantee for the spring-planted smooth green dry edible pea type;</P>
              <P>(2) 400,000-pound guarantee × $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 value of guarantee for the spring-planted smooth green dry edible pea type;</P>
              <P>(4) 100 acres × 5,000 pounds = 500,000-pound production to count for the contract seed pea type;</P>
              <P>(5) 500,000-pound guarantee × $0.40 base contract price = $200,000.00 gross value of guarantee for the contract seed pea type;</P>
              <P>(6) $200,000 × .75 price election percentage = $150,000 net value of guarantee for the contract seed pea type;</P>
              <P>(8) $36,000.00 + $150,000.00 = $186,000.00 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(9) 200,000-pound production to count × $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of production to count for the spring-planted smooth green dry edible pea type;</P>
              <P>(10) 450,000-pound production to count × $0.30 = $135,000.00 value of production to count for the contract seed pea type;</P>
              <P>(11) $18,000.00 + $135,000.00 = $153,000.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(12) $186,000.00 − $153,000.00 = $33,000.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(13) $33,000.00 loss × 100 percent share = $33,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The value of contract seed pea production to count for each variety in the unit will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For mature production meeting the objective, measurable minimum quality requirements (e.g., size, germination percentage) contained in the processor/seed company contract, and for mature production that does not meet such requirements due to uninsured causes:</P>
              <P>(i) Multiplying the local market price or base contract price per pound, whichever is greater, by the price election percentage you selected; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such production.</P>
              <P>(2) For mature production not meeting the objective, measurable minimum quality requirements (e.g., size, germination percentage) contained in the processor/seed company contract, due to insurable causes, and immature production that is appraised:</P>
              <P>(i) Multiplying the highest local market price available for such dry peas by the price election percentage you selected; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such production.</P>
              <P>(d) The total dry pea production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of dry peas may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with section 12 (c) or (e), if applicable); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(e) Mature dry pea production that does not qualify as contract seed peas under the policy terms or does not meet the objective, measurable minimum quality requirements (e.g., size, germination percentage) contained in the processor/seed company contract, may be adjusted for quality deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment in accordance with the following, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions:</P>

              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the United States Standards for Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, result in production grading U.S. No. 2 or worse because of defects, color, skinned production <PRTPAGE P="303"/>(lentils only), odor, material weathering, or distinctly low quality; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(2) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these Crop Provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net price for the damaged production that is less than the local market price;</P>
              <P>(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</P>
              <P>(iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:</P>
              <P>(A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</P>
              <P>(B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</P>
              <P>(C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</P>
              <P>(v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</P>
              <P>(3) Dry Pea production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 12(e) (1) and (2), will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The highest local market price for the qualifying damaged production will be determined on the earlier of the date such damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The highest local market price for the qualifying damaged production will be determined in the local area to the extent feasible. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver the dry peas to those buyers. Discounts used to establish the net value of the damaged production will be limited to those that are usual, customary, and reasonable.</P>
              <P>The value will not be reduced for:</P>
              <P>(A) Moisture content;</P>
              <P>(B) Damage due to uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the dry peas; except, if the value of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the value of the production after it has been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production before conditioning;</P>
              <P>(ii) The value per pound of the damaged or conditioned production will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment factor;</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of pounds of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment factor to determine the production count to be included in section 13(d); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">15. Winter Coverage Option</HD>
              <P>(a) In the event of a conflict between this section and sections 1 through 14 of these Crop Provisions, this section will control.</P>
              <P>(b) You must have purchased additional coverage under the Dry Pea Crop Provisions in order to select this option.</P>
              <P>(c) In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this option is available in counties for which the actuarial documents provide premium rates for the Winter Coverage Option.</P>
              <P>(d) This option is available only in counties for which the Special Provisions designate both a fall final planting date and a spring final planting date.</P>
              <P>(e) You must select this option on your application for insurance, or on a form approved by us, on or before the sales closing date for the initial year in which you wish to insure dry peas under this option.</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to do so means you have rejected this coverage for the dry pea crop planted in the fall and this option is void.</P>
              <P>(2) This option will continue in effect until canceled or coverage under the Dry Pea Crop Provisions is canceled or terminated.</P>

              <P>(3) This option may be canceled by you or us for any succeeding crop year by giving <PRTPAGE P="304"/>written notice to the other party on or before the cancellation date contained in section 15(g) preceding the crop year for which the cancellation of this option is to be effective.</P>
              <P>(4) You may change your coverage level or percentage of price election for dry pea types until the spring sales closing date if you have selected this option, but do not have any insured fall planted acreage or your fall planted acreage is not eligible for this option.</P>
              <P>(f) Coverage under this option begins on the later of the date we accept your application for coverage or on the fall final planting date designated in the Special Provisions. Coverage ends on the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(g) If you elect this option for dry peas initially planted in the fall, the following dates will be applicable to all your fall-planted and spring-planted dry peas in the county:</P>
              <P>(1) Contract change date is June 30 preceding the cancellation date;</P>
              <P>(2) Cancellation date is September 30; and</P>
              <P>(3) Termination date is November 30. For a policy with amounts due, when the sales closing date is prior to the previous crop year termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity, prevented planting or replant payment will be owed.</P>
              <P>(h) All notices of damage must be provided to us not later than 15 days after the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(i) All insurable acreage of each fall planted dry pea type covered under this option must be insured.</P>
              <P>(j) The amount of any indemnity paid under the terms of this option will be subject to any reduction specified in the Basic Provisions for multiple crop benefits in the same crop year.</P>
              <P>(k) Whenever any acreage of dry peas planted in the fall is damaged during the insurance period and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured planted acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may, at your option, take one of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Continue to care for the damaged dry peas. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Basic Provisions, these Crop Provisions and this option;</P>
              <P>(2) Replant the acreage to an appropriate type of insured dry peas, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms of section 11. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Basic Provisions, these Crop Provisions and this option, and the production guarantee for the dry pea type planted in the fall will remain in effect; or</P>
              <P>(3) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage:</P>
              <P>(i) By destroying the remaining crop, you agree to accept an appraised amount of production determined in accordance with section 13(d)(1) of these Crop Provisions to count against the unit production guarantee. This amount will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in section 13.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop if such insurance is available.</P>
              <P>(iii) If you elect to plant and elect to insure spring-planted dry pea acreage of the same dry pea type (you must elect whether or not you want insurance on the spring-planted acreage of the same dry pea type at the time we release the fall-planted acreage), you must pay additional premium for insurance. Such acreage will be insured in accordance with the policy provisions that are applicable to acreage that is initially planted in the spring to the same dry pea type, and you must:</P>
              <P>(A) Plant the spring-planted acreage in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining acreage of the fall-planted dry pea acreage; and</P>
              <P>(B) Store or market the production in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring-planted production separately from any fall-planted production. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring-planted acreage will be considered to be a part of the original fall-planted unit.</P>

              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured cause of loss specified in sections 9(a)(1) through (7), drought, or the intrusion of saline water; or</P>
              <P>(9) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to the application of saline water, except as specified in section 9(a)(8) of these crop provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Replanting Payment</HD>
              <P>(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;</P>

              <P>(4) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate that is normal for initially planted rice (if new seed is planted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of rice, the acreage will not be eligible for a replanting payment).</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or 400 pounds, multiplied by your projected price, multiplied by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>

              <P>Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(1)(i) or 12(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the production to count by your:</P>
              <P>(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(4) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(3)(i) or 12(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(5) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(4) from the result of section 12(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(5) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of rice in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 3,750 pounds, your projected price is $.0750, your harvest price is $.0700, and your production to count is 150,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>If you elected yield protection:<PRTPAGE P="307"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (3,750 pound production guarantee × $.0750 projected price) = $14,062.50 value of the production guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 150,000 pound production to count × $.0750 projected price = $11,250.00 value of the production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $14,062.50 − $11,250.00 = $2,812.50</P>
              <P>(6) $2,812.50 × 1.000 share = $2,813.00 indemnity; or</P>
              <P>If you elected revenue protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (3,750 pound production guarantee × $.0750 projected price) = $14,062.50 revenue protection guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 150,000 pound production to count × $.0700 harvest price = $10,500.00 value of the production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $14,062.50 − $10,500.00 = $3,562.50</P>
              <P>(6) $3,562.50 × 1.000 share = $3,563.00 indemnity.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For yield protection, not less than the production guarantee and for revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:</P>

              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 12(d));</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any production from a second rice crop harvested in the same crop year.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature rough rice may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 12 percent. We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Rice, result in rice not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of red rice, chalky kernels or damaged kernels;</P>
              <P>(ii) The rice has a total milling yield of less than 68 pounds per hundredweight;</P>
              <P>(iii) The whole kernel weight is less than 55 pounds per hundredweight of milled rice for medium and short grain varieties;</P>
              <P>(iv) The whole kernel weight is less than 48 pounds per hundredweight of milled rice for long grain varieties; or</P>
              <P>(v) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 12(d)(2) resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 12(d)(2) result in a net price for the damaged production that is less than the local market price;</P>
              <P>(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 12(d)(2) are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</P>
              <P>(iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:</P>
              <P>(A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</P>

              <P>(B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or<PRTPAGE P="308"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</P>
              <P>(v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</P>
              <P>(4) Rice production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 12(d) (2) and (3), will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) In accordance with quality adjustment factors contained in the Special Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If quality adjustment factors are not contained in the Special Provisions, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to those that are usual, customary, and reasonable. The price will not be reduced for:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Moisture content;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Damage due to uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the rice; except, if the price of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the price of the production after it has been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production before conditioning,</P>
              <P>(We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver the rice to those buyers.);</P>
              <P>(B) The value of the damaged or conditioned production will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment factor; and</P>
              <P>(C) The number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross pounds (if appropriate)) of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment factor to determine the net production to count.</P>
              <P>(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(b) We must be given the opportunity to perform a grade inspection on the production from any unit for which you have given notice of damage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; and</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee (If there is unharvested acreage in the unit, the harvested and unharvested acreage will be determined separately);</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election (The price election may be limited as specified in section 3.);</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable (see section 11(d)), by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results of section 11(b)(5) from the result in section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 harvested acres of potatoes in the unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price election of $4.00 per hundredweight. You are only able to harvest 10,000 hundredweight. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 15,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $60,000.00 − $40,000.00 = $20,000.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $20,000.00 × 100 percent = $20,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 100 unharvested acres of potatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price election of $3.60 per hundredweight. (The price election for unharvested acreage is 90.0 percent of your elected price election ($4.00 × 0.90 = $3.60.)) This unharvested acreage was appraised at 35 hundredweight per acre for a total of 3500 hundredweight as production to count. Your total indemnity for the harvested and unharvested acreage would be calculated as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) 100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee for the harvested acreage, and<PRTPAGE P="311"/>
              </P>
              <P>100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee for the unharvested acreage;</P>
              <P>(2) 15,000 hundredweight guarantee × $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value of guarantee for the harvested acreage, and</P>
              <P>15,000 hundredweight guarantee × $3.60 price election = $54,000.00 value of guarantee for the unharvested acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) $60,000.00 + $54,000.00 = $114,000.00 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value of production to count for the harvested acreage, and 3500 hundredweight × $3.60 = $12,600.00 value of production to count for the unharvested acreage;</P>
              <P>(5) $40,000.00 + $12,600.00 = $52,600.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $114,000.00 − $52,600.00 = $61,400.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $61,400.00 loss × 100 percent = $61,400.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The extent of any quality loss must be determined based on samples obtained no later than the time the potatoes are placed in storage, if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date they are delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, broker, or other handler if production is not stored.</P>
              <P>(d) The total production to count (in hundredweight) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(D) From which any production is disposed of without a grade inspection; or</P>
              <P>(E) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity. Production to count from such acreage will be determined by increasing the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day for each day the potatoes were harvested prior to the date the potatoes would have reached full maturity. The date the potatoes would have reached full maturity will be considered to be 45 days prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. This adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are damaged by an insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field would either reduce production or decrease quality;</P>
              <P>(iv) Unharvested production, including unharvested production on insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, or acreage damaged by insurable causes and for which you cease to provide further care, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or cease providing care for the crop. This unharvested production may be adjusted in accordance with sections 11(e), (f), and (g); and the value of all unharvested production will be calculated using the reduced price election determined in section 2(b). If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to determine the amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified in section 2 even if the representative samples are harvested. The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage (the amount of production prior to the sorting or discarding of any production).</P>
              <P>(e) Potato production is eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(1) The potatoes have freeze damage or tuber rot that is evident at, or prior to, the end of the insurance period; and</P>
              <P>(2) A grade inspection is completed no later than 21 days after the end of the insurance period (if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable, samples must be obtained within 60 days after the end of the insurance period and quality (grade) determinations must be completed with 21 days of sampling); and</P>
              <P>(3) Prior to any grade inspection, you must notify us of the intended use of the potatoes so the appropriate United States standards will be applied (We may request previous sales records to verify your claimed intended use or base the intended use on the type of potato grown if such potatoes are not usually grown for the intended use you reported).</P>

              <P>(f) Potato production to count that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in section 11(e), with 5 percent damage or less (by weight) will be adjusted 0.1 percent for <PRTPAGE P="312"/>each 0.1 percent of damage through 5.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(g) Potato production to count that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in section 11(e), with 5.1 percent damage or more (by weight) will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If a price is agreed upon between you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, or the production is delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the price per hundredweight received or that will be received by the highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</P>
              <P>(2) If a price is not agreed upon between you and a buyer and the production is not delivered within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, and that remain in storage 22 or more days (61 or more days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be the greater of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount determined by:</P>
              <P>(A) Dividing the price per hundredweight that is received, or will be received after the end of the applicable insurance period, by the highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the result of section 11(g)(2)(i)(A) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of production determined by:</P>
              <P>(A) Reducing any harvested or appraised production:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) By 0.1 percent for each 0.1 percent damage through 5.0 percent;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) By 0.5 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 5.1 percent through 6.0 percent;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) By 1.0 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 6.1 through 13.5 percent; or</P>
              <P>(B) Including 15 percent of the production when damage is in excess of 13.5 percent.</P>
              <P>(iii) For any production discarded:</P>
              <P>(A) Within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Zero if we determine the production could not have been sold; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Determined in accordance with section 11(g)(2)(ii) if we determine the production could have been sold; or</P>
              <P>(B) Later than 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be adjusted in accordance with section 11(g)(2)(ii).</P>

                <E T="03">Percentage factor.</E> The historical average percentage of potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better, by type, determined from your records. If at least 4 continuous years of records are available, the percentage factor will be the simple average of the available <PRTPAGE P="313"/>records not to exceed 10 years. If less than 4 years of records are available, the percentage factor will be determined based on a combination of your records and the percentage factor contained in the Special Provisions so that such a combination would be the functional equivalent of 4 years of records.</P>
              <P>2. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this endorsement will control.</P>
              <P>3. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the cancellation date.</P>
              <P>4. All acreage of potatoes insured under the Northern Potato Crop Provisions will be insured under this endorsement except:</P>
              <P>(a) Any acreage specifically excluded by the actuarial documents; and</P>
              <P>(b) Any acreage grown for seed.</P>
              <P>5. We will adjust the production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions for potatoes that do not meet U.S. No. 2 grade requirements from unharvested acreage or harvested acreage that is stored or is marketed after a grade inspection due to:</P>
              <P>(a) Internal defects as long as the number of potatoes with such defects are in excess of the tolerances allowed for the U.S. No. 2 grade potatoes on a lot basis and are not separable from undamaged production using methods used by the packers or processors to whom you normally deliver your potato production as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If a price is agreed upon between you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, or the production is delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be determined by (adjustment under section 5(a)(1) or 5(a)(2)(i) will not be performed if it already has been performed under the terms of section 11(g) of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions):</P>

              <P>(B) Multiplying the result of section 5(a)(2)(i)(A) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of production determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The combined weight of sampled potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better (the amount of potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 will be based on a grade inspection completed no later than 21 days after the end of the insurance period (if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), samples must be obtained within 60 days after the end of the insurance period and a grade inspection completed within 21 days of sampling) and are damaged by freeze or tuber rot will be divided by the total sample weight;</P>
              <P>(B) The percentage determined in section 5(a)(2)(ii)(A) will be divided by the applicable percentage factor; and</P>

              <P>7. Potatoes harvested or appraised prior to full maturity that do not grade U.S. No. 2 due solely to size will be considered to have met U.S. No. 2 standards unless the potatoes are damaged by an insurable cause of loss and leaving the crop in the field would either reduce production or decrease quality.</P>
              <P>8. Production to count for potatoes destroyed, stored or marketed without a grade inspection will be 100 percent of the gross weight of such potatoes.</P>
              <P>9. All determinations must be based upon a grade inspection.</P>
              <P>10. The actuarial documents may provide “U.S. No. 1 grade” in place of “U.S. No. 2 grade” as used in this endorsement.</P>
              <P>(a) If both U.S. No.1 and U.S. No. 2 grades are available in the actuarial documents, you may elect U.S. No. 1 or 2 grade by potato type or group, if separate types or groups are specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) If both fresh and processing types are specified in the actuarial documents, you cannot elect the fresh type for any potatoes grown for processing or chipping.</P>

              </P>
              <P>4. All terms of the Northern Potato Quality Endorsement not modified by this endorsement will be applicable to acreage covered under this endorsement.</P>
              <P>5. If you elect this endorsement, all insurable acreage of production under contract with the processor or broker must be insured under this endorsement; however:</P>
              <P>(a) When the processor contract requires the processor or broker to purchase a stated amount of production, rather than all of the production from a stated number of acres, the insurable acres will be determined by dividing the stated amount of production by the approved yield for the acreage; and</P>
              <P>(b) The number of acres insured under this endorsement will not exceed the actual number of acres planted to the potato types needed to fulfill the contract.</P>
              <P>6. Potato lots may be adjusted in accordance with section 8 if such potatoes:</P>
              <P>(a) Fail to meet the standards in section 7(a), (b), (c), or (d), or a standard contained in the processor contract, for the same quality factors specified in section 7(a), (b), (c), or (d), if such standard is less stringent;</P>
              <P>(b) Have a value less than the maximum price election; and</P>
              <P>(c) Fail to meet the applicable standards and are not separable from undamaged production using methods used by processors to whom you normally deliver your potato production.</P>
              <P>7. To qualify for a quality reduction under this endorsement, the potatoes must:</P>
              <P>(a) Fail to meet the applicable U.S. No. 2 grade requirements due to internal defects as long as the number of potatoes with such defects are in excess of the tolerance allowed for U.S. No. 2 grade potatoes;</P>
              <P>(b) Have a specific gravity lower than 1.074;</P>

              <P>(d) Have an Agtron rating lower than 58.</P>
              <P>8. In lieu of the provisions contained in section 5 of the Northern Potato Quality Endorsement, production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, from unharvested acreage or harvested acreage that is stored or is marketed after a grade inspection determined in section 10, will be adjusted in accordance with sections 8(a) or 8(b), whichever is applicable, (adjustment under section 8(a) or 8(b)(1) will not be performed if it already has been performed under the terms of section 11(g) of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions):</P>
              <P>(a) If a price is agreed upon between you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, or the production is delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(1) Dividing the price per hundredweight received or that will be received by the highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (If the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result of section 8(a)(1) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</P>
              <P>(b) If a price is not agreed upon between you and a buyer and the production is not delivered within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, and the production remains in storage 22 or more days (61 or more days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be the greater of:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount of production determined by:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the price per hundredweight that is received, or that will later be received after the end of the applicable insurance period, by the highest price election designated in the Special Provisions or addendum thereto for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the result of section 8(b)(1)(i) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of production determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The combined weight of sampled potatoes that grade U.S. No. 2 or better (the amount of potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better will be based on a grade inspection completed no later than 21 days after the end of the insurance period, if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable; samples must be obtained within 60 days after the end of the insurance period and grade inspection completed within 21 days of sampling) and are damaged by freeze or tuber rot will be divided by the total sample weight;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) The percentage determined in section 8(b)(2)(i) will be divided by the applicable percentage factor; and<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The result of section 8(b)(2)(i)(A) will be multiplied by the amount of production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) The production to count for potatoes that have a value less than the maximum price election due to factors other than those specified in section 7 will be adjusted in accordance with section 8(b)(2).</P>
              <P>9. For any production that qualifies for adjustment in accordance with section 7 and that is discarded:</P>
              <P>(a) Within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be:</P>
              <P>(1) Zero if we determine the production could not have been sold; or</P>
              <P>(2) Determined in accordance with section 8(b)(2) if we determine the production could have been sold; or</P>
              <P>(b) Later than 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be adjusted in accordance with section 8(b)(2).</P>
              <P>10. All quality determinations must be based upon a grade inspection using the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes for Processing or the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes for Chipping.</P>
              <P>11. The actuarial documents may provide “U.S. No. 1 grade” in place of “U.S. No. 2 grade” as used in this endorsement. If both U.S. No. 1 and 2 grades are available in the actuarial documents, you may elect U.S. No. 1 or 2 grade by potato type or group, if separate types or groups are specified in the Special Provisions.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Potato Crop Insurance Certified Seed Endorsement</HD>
              <P>1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein. In accordance with section 8, since your insurance period is not extended in this endorsement, any additional premium paid for coverage under the Northern Potato Storage Coverage Endorsement will not apply to the additional coverage provided under the terms of this endorsement. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this endorsement will control.</P>
              <P>2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year you wish to insure your potatoes under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the cancellation date.</P>
              <P>3. All potatoes grown on insurable acreage and that are entered into the potato seed certification program administered by the state in which the seed is grown must be insured unless limited by section 4 below.</P>
              <P>4. Your certified seed production guarantee per-acre will be the per-acre production guarantee used to cover the same acreage under the terms of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. However, unless a written agreement provides otherwise, if the total amount of insurable certified seed acreage you have for the current crop year is greater than 125 percent of your average number of acres entered into and passing certification in the potato certified seed program in the three previous calendar years, your certified seed production guarantee for each unit will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Multiply the average number of your acres entered into and passing certification in the potato certified seed program the 3 previous calendar years by 1.25 and divide this result by the number of acres grown by you for certified seed in the current crop year; and</P>
              <P>(b) Multiply the result of section 4(a) (not to exceed 1.0) by the production guarantee for certified seed for the current crop year.</P>
              <P>5. You must provide acceptable records of your certified seed potato acreage and production for the previous three years. These records must clearly indicate the number of your acres entered into the potato seed certification program administered by the state in which the seed is grown.</P>

              <P>6. All potatoes insured for certified seed production must be produced and managed in accordance with the regulations, standards, practices, and procedures required for certification under the potato certified seed program. Any production that does not qualify as certified seed because of varietal mixing or your failure to meet any requirements under the potato certified seed program will <PRTPAGE P="317"/>be considered as lost due to uninsured causes.</P>
              <P>7. If, due to insurable causes occurring within the insurance period, the amount of certified seed you produce is less than your certified seed production guarantee, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(a) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective certified seed production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(b) Multiplying each result in section 7(a) by the dollar amount per hundredweight contained in the Special Provisions for production covered under this endorsement;</P>
              <P>(c) Totaling the results of section 7(b);</P>
              <P>(d) Multiplying the number of hundredweight of production that qualify as certified seed and any amount of production lost due to uninsured causes, or that does not qualify as certified seed due to uninsured causes, by the dollar amount per hundredweight contained in the Special Provisions for production covered under this endorsement;</P>
              <P>(e) Subtracting the result of section 7(d) from the result of section 7(c); and</P>
              <P>(f) Multiplying the result of section 7(e) by your share.</P>
              <P>8. You must notify us of any loss under this endorsement not later than 14 days after you receive notice from the state certification agency that any acreage or production has failed certification. Nothing herein extends the insurance period beyond the time period specified in section 8 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and section 11 of the Basic Provisions. In lieu of the provisions in section 14(c) of the Basic Provisions specifying that any claim for indemnity must be filed not later than 60 days after the end of the insurance period, your claim for indemnity must be filed by the later of:</P>
              <P>(a) Sixty (60) days after the end of the insurance period; or</P>
              <P>(b) Thirty (30) days after you receive notice from the state certifying agency that production has failed certification.</P>
              <P>9. Acreage covered under the terms of this endorsement will have the same unit structure as provided under the Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if you have two optional units (00101 and 00102) under your Northern Potato Crop Insurance Policy and you elect this endorsement, you will also have two optional units (00201 and 00202) for certified seed coverage, provided that certified seed is grown in both units 00101 and 00102. Or, if you have two basic units (00100 and 00200) under your Northern Potato Crop Insurance Policy and you elect this endorsement, you will also have two basic units (00300 and 00400) for certified seed coverage, provided that certified seed is grown in both units 00100 and 00200. In the event certified seed acreage is not grown in the same optional or basic units as acreage covered under the Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, certified seed units will be established in accordance with the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if a basic unit is divided into two optional units for potato acreage covered under the Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, but certified seed is grown in only one of those optional units, the certified seed acreage will be insured as one basic unit.</P>
              <P>10. Failure to meet any requirements for seed to be used to produce a subsequent seed crop will not be covered. All the production that meets requirements for certified seed used to produce a commercial crop will be included in production to count.</P>

            <P>The Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement Provisions for the 2008 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

              <FP>Both FCIC and reinsured policies:</FP>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement</HD>
              <P>1. In return for payment of the required additional premium as contained in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this endorsement will control.</P>
              <P>2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the cancellation date.</P>

              <P>3. Potato production grown under a contract that requires the production to be delivered to a buyer within three days of harvest will not be insured under this endorsement. When such contract requires delivery <PRTPAGE P="318"/>of a stated amount of production, rather than all of the production from a stated amount of acres, the number of acres not insured under this endorsement will be determined by dividing the stated amount of production by the approved yield for the acreage. All other potato production insured under the Northern Potato Crop Provisions must be insured under this endorsement unless the Special Provisions allow you to exclude certain potato varieties, types, or groups from this endorsement, and you elect to exercise this option. If you elect this endorsement, such exclusions must be shown annually on your acreage report and will be applicable to all acreage of the excluded varieties, types, or groups for the crop year.</P>
              <P>4. When production from separate insurance units, basic or optional, is commingled in storage, the production to count for each unit will be allocated pro rata based on the production placed in storage from each unit. Such allocation will be allowed only if verifiable records of production placed in storage are available by unit. If you do not have verifiable records, all units without verifiable records will be combined in accordance with section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if 500 hundredweight from one unit are commingled with 1,500 hundredweight from another unit and the production to count from the stored production is 1,000 hundredweight, 250 hundredweight of production to count will be allocated to the unit contributing 500 hundredweight and 750 hundredweight to the unit contributing 1500 hundredweight to the stored production. This provision does not eliminate or change any other requirement contained in this policy to provide or maintain separate records of acreage or production by unit.</P>
              <P>5. In lieu of section 9(b)(1) of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, the extended coverage provided by this endorsement will be applicable but only if:</P>
              <P>(a) Insured potatoes are damaged within the insurance period by an insured cause other than freeze that later results in:</P>
              <P>(1) Tuber rot as defined in the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, to the extent that 5.1 percent (by weight) or more of the insured production is affected;</P>
              <P>(2) Internal defects to the extent that such defects are in excess of the amount allowed for the U.S. grade standard you elected for purposes of coverage under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality Endorsement. Such defects must not be separable from undamaged production using methods used by the packers or processors to which you normally deliver your potato production. This coverage is applicable only to production covered under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality Endorsement; or</P>
              <P>(3) The potatoes damaged by an insurance cause of loss fail to meet any of the following standards or a less stringent standard for the same quality factors specified below, contained in the processor contract, if applicable, (this coverage is applicable only to production covered under the Northern Potato Processing Quality Endorsement):</P>
              <P>(i) A specific gravity lower than 1.074;</P>
              <P>(ii) A fry color of No. 3 or darker due to either sugar exceeding 10 percent or sugar ends exceeding 19 percent; or</P>
              <P>(iii) An Agtron rating lower than 58.</P>
              <P>(b) You notify us within 72 hours of your initial discovery of any damage that has or that may later result in the quality deficiencies specified in section 5(a);</P>
              <P>(c) The percentage of production with any of the quality deficiencies specified in section 5(a) is determined based on samples obtained no later than 60 days after the end of the insurance period and the potatoes are evaluated and quality (grade) determinations are made by us, a laboratory approved by us, a potato grader licensed or certified by the applicable State or the United States Department of Agriculture, or us, in accordance with the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes:</P>
              <P>(1) Samples of damaged production must be obtained by us or a party approved by us prior to the sale or disposal of any lot of potatoes; and</P>
              <P>(2) If production is not sold or disposed of within 60 days after the end of the insurance period, samples must be obtained within 60 days after the end of the insurance period and a quality (grade) determination must be completed within 21 days of sampling.</P>

              <P>A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will be divided into additional basic units by planting period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 2 of the Basic Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the potatoes in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type. If the Special Provisions provide for different price elections by type, you may select one price election for each potato type designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</P>
              <P>(b) If the production from any acreage of the insured crop is not harvested, the price used to determine your indemnity will be 90 percent of your price election.</P>
              <P>(c) The price election for unharvested acreage will apply to any acreage of potatoes damaged to the extent that similarly situated producers in the area would not normally care for the potatoes even if you choose to continue to care for or harvest them. Potatoes that are lifted to the soil surface and not removed from the field will also receive the price election for unharvested acreage.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against as contained in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Damage that occurs or becomes evident after the end of the insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that occurs or becomes evident in storage; or</P>
              <P>(2) Causes, such as freeze after certain dates, as limited by the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples at least 10 feet wide and extending the entire length of each field in the unit if you are going to destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(b) We must be given the opportunity to perform a grade inspection on the production from any unit for which you have given notice of damage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; and</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee (if there is unharvested acreage in the unit, the harvested and unharvested acreage will be determined separately);</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election (the price election may be limited as specified in section 3.);</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable, (see section 12(d)) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(5) from the result in section 12(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example: You have a 100 percent share in 100 harvested acres of potatoes in the unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price election of $4.00 per hundredweight. You are only able to harvest 10,000 hundredweight. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 15,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(5) $60,000.00 − $40,000.00 = $20,000.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(6) $20,000.00 × 100 percent = $20,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 100 unharvested acres of potatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price election of $3.60 per hundredweight. (The price election for unharvested acreage is 90.0 percent of your elected price election ($4.00 × 0.90 = $3.60.)) This unharvested acreage was appraised at 35 hundredweight per acre for a total of 3500 hundredweight as production to count. Your total indemnity for the harvested and unharvested acreage would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee for the harvested acreage, and</P>
              <P>100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee for the unharvested acreage;</P>
              <P>(2) 15,000 hundredweight guarantee × $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value of guarantee for the harvested acreage, and</P>
              <P>15,000 hundredweight guarantee × $3.60 price election = $54,000.00 value of guarantee for the unharvested acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) $60,000.00 + $54,000.00 = $114,000.00 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value of production to count for the harvested acreage, and 3500 hundredweight × $3.60 = $12,600.00 value of production to count for the unharvested acreage;</P>
              <P>(5) $40,000.00 + $12,600.00 = $52,600.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $114,000.00 − $52,600.00 = $61,400.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $61,400.00 loss × 100 percent = $61,400.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The extent of any quality loss must be determined based on samples obtained no later than the time potatoes are placed in storage, if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date they are delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, broker, or other handler if production is not stored.</P>
              <P>(d) The total production to count (in hundredweight) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;</P>

              <P>(D) From which any production is disposed of without a grade inspection; or<PRTPAGE P="322"/>
              </P>
              <P>(E) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity. Production to count from such acreage will be determined by increasing the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day for each day the potatoes were harvested prior to the date the potatoes would have reached full maturity. The date the potatoes would have reached full maturity will be considered to be 45 days prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. This adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are damaged by an insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field would either reduce production or decrease quality.</P>
              <P>(iv) Unharvested production, including unharvested production on insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, or acreage damaged by insurable causes and for which you cease to provide further care, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or cease providing care for the crop. This unharvested production may be adjusted in accordance with sections 12(e), and the value of all unharvested production will be calculated using the reduced price election determined in section 3(b). If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to determine the amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified in section 3 even if the representative samples are harvested. The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage determined in accordance with section 12(e).</P>
              <P>(e) Only marketable lots of mature potatoes will be production to count for loss adjustment purposes, except for production specified in 12(e)(1):</P>
              <P>(1) Production not meeting the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 due to external defects will be determined on an individual basis for all harvested and unharvested potatoes if we determine it is or would be practical to separate the damaged production;</P>
              <P>(2) All determinations must be based upon a grade inspection; and</P>
              <P>(3) Prior to any grade inspection, you must notify us of the intended use of the potatoes so the appropriate United States Standard will be applied (We may request previous sales records to verify your claimed intended use or base the intended use on the type of potato grown if such potatoes are not usually grown for the intended use you reported).</P>
              <P>(4) Marketable lots of potatoes will include any lot of potatoes that is:</P>
              <P>(i) Stored;</P>
              <P>(ii) Sold as seed;</P>
              <P>(iii) Sold for human consumption; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Harvested and not sold or that is appraised if such lots meet the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 grade or better on a sample basis.</P>
              <P>(5) Marketable lots will also include any potatoes that we determine:</P>
              <P>(i) Could have been sold for seed or human consumption in the general marketing area;</P>
              <P>(ii) Were not sold as a result of uninsured causes including, but not limited to, failure to meet chipper or processor standards for fry color or specific gravity; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Were disposed of without our prior written consent and such disposition prevented our determination of marketability.</P>
              <P>(6) Unless included in section 12(e)(4) or (5), a potato lot will not be considered marketable if, due to insurable causes of damage, it:</P>
              <P>(i) Is partially damaged, and is salvageable only for starch, alcohol, or livestock feed;</P>
              <P>(ii) Does not meet the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 grade or better due to internal defects; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not meet the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 grade or better due to external defects, and it is not practical to separate the damaged production.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):<PRTPAGE P="325"/>
              </P>

              <P>(i) To replant such acreage and collect any replant payment due as specified in section 12. The initial planting period coverage will continue for such replanted acreage.</P>
              <P>(ii) Not to replant such acreage and receive an indemnity based on the stage of growth the plants had attained at the time of damage. However, such an election will result in the acreage being uninsurable in the subsequent planting period.</P>
              <P>(3) We will not insure any acreage on which peppers (except for replanted peppers in accordance with sections 9(b)(1) and (2)), tomatoes, eggplants, or tobacco have been grown and the soil was not fumigated or otherwise properly treated before planting peppers.</P>

              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production.

              <P>(A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine actual production (If we require you to continue to care for the crop and you do not do so, the original appraisal will be used); or</P>
              <P>(B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop, in which case the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.</P>
              <P>(3) The total value of all harvested production from the insurable acreage will be the dollar amount obtained by subtracting the allowable cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price received for each box of peppers (this result may not be less than the minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for any box of peppers), and multiplying this result by the number of boxes of peppers harvested. Harvested production that is damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is not marketable, will not be counted as production to count.</P>

              <P>(ii) For marketable production that is not sold, the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the number of boxes of such peppers on the unit by the minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for the planting period (harvested production that is damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is not marketable will not be counted as production).</P>

              <P>(2) If you selected Option II of the Minimum Value Option, the total value of harvested production will be as provided in section 16(b)(1), except that the dollar amount <PRTPAGE P="327"/>specified in section 16(b)(1)(i) may not be less than zero.</P>

The coverage level you choose for each table grape type is not required to have same percentage relationship. The price election you choose for each type is not required to have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 75 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 65 percent coverage level and 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type. If you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of insurance for any grape type, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured grape acreage in the county.</P>
              <P>(c) In all states except Arizona and California, if you acquire a share in any grape acreage after you submit your application, such acreage is insurable under the terms of the policy and you did not include the grape type on your application, we will assign the following:</P>

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if your application is received by us after January 12 but prior to February 1 in Arizona or California, or after November 1 but prior to November 21 in all other states, insurance will attach on the 20th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 20-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the vineyard.</P>
              <P>(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(3) If in accordance with the terms of the policy, your table grape policy is cancelled or terminated for any crop year after insurance attached for that crop year, but on or before the cancellation and termination dates, whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <P>(4) The calendar date for the end of insurance period for each crop year is the date specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable; insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of table grapes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due or indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the vineyard;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, except as excluded in 10(b)(1), but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(6) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Phylloxera, regardless of cause; or</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the table grapes for any reason other than the actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties In the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>

              <P>(c) If the crop has been damaged during the growing season and you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the <PRTPAGE P="330"/>Basic Provisions, you must also provide notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity as a result of the damage previously reported. You must not destroy the damaged crop until the earlier of 15 days from the date you gave notice of loss, or our written consent to do so. If you fail to meet requirements of this section all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election you selected for each type or variety;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count of each type or variety, if applicable, (see section 12(c)) by the respective price election you selected;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(5) from the result in section 12(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in lugs) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements in section 11(b);</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production that meets, or would meet if properly handled, the state quality standards, if specified in the Special Provisions, or the appropriate USDA grade standard (if no state standard is specified); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from insurable acreage regardless of condition or disposition. The quantity of production to count for table grape production damaged by insurable causes within the insurance period that is marketed for any use other than table grapes will be determined by multiplying the greater of (1) the value of the table grapes per ton or (2) $50, by the number of tons and dividing that result by the highest price election available for the insured unit. This result will be the number of lugs to count.</P>

For production based seed bean processor contracts, the basic unit will consist of all the acreage needed to produce the amount of production under contract, based on the actual production history of the acreage. For acreage based seed bean processor contracts, the basic unit will consist of all acreage specified in the contract.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage as provided in the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, a separate optional unit may be established for each bean type shown in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) Contract seed beans may qualify for optional units only if the seed bean processor contract specifies the number of acres under contract. Contract seed beans produced under a seed bean processor contract that specifies only an amount of production or a combination of acreage and production, are not eligible for optional units.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>

              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3(b) (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage <PRTPAGE P="332"/>Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), you may select only one price election for all the dry beans in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select one price election for each dry bean type designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type are not required to have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may also choose 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type.</P>
              <P>(b) For contract seed beans only, the dollar amount of insurance is obtained by multiplying the production guarantee per acre for each variety in the unit by the insured acreage of that variety, times the applicable base price, and times the price election percentage you selected. The total of these results will be the amount of insurance for contract seed beans in the unit.</P>

              <P>(b) For contract seed beans only:</P>
              <P>(1) An instrument in the form of a “lease” under which you retain control of the acreage on which the insured crop is grown and that provides for delivery of the crop under substantially the same terms as a seed bean processor contract may be treated as a contract under which you have an insurable interest in the crop; and</P>
              <P>(2) We will not insure any acreage of contract seed beans produced by a seed company.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the types of dry beans designated in the Special Provisions, we will insure other types if:</P>

              <P>(3) Both parties (you and us) enter into a written agreement allowing insurance on the type in accordance with section 18 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <P>(d) Any acreage of beans that is destroyed and replanted to a different insurable type of beans will be considered insured acreage in accordance with section 11.</P>

              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation requirements contained in the Special Provisions; or</P>

              <P>(b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that the majority of growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that replanting is not practical. We will not require <PRTPAGE P="333"/>you to replant if it is not practical to replant to the same type of beans as originally planted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the date immediately following planting as follows:</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Replanting Payments</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the bean crop is damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 10 percent of the production guarantee for the type to be replanted or 120 pounds multiplied by your price election for the type to be replanted and by your insured share.</P>
              <P>(c) When beans are replanted using a practice that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(d) The guarantee and premium for acreage replanted to a different insurable type will be based on the replanted type and will be calculated in accordance with sections 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) and 7 (Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8) and section 3 of these Crop Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage to your bean crop covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage of each dry bean type by its respective production guarantee;</P>

              <P>(10) Totaling the value of all contract seed bean production (see section 13(c));</P>
              <P>(11) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(9) and section 13(b)(10);</P>
              <P>(12) Subtracting the total in section 13(b)(11) from the total in section 13(b)(8); and</P>
              <P>(13) Multiplying the result by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The value of contract seed bean production to count for each type in the unit will be determined as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For production meeting the minimum quality requirements contained in the seed bean processor contract and for production that does not meet such requirements due to uninsured causes:<PRTPAGE P="334"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Multiplying the actual value or base price per pound, whichever is greater, by the price election percentage you selected; and</P>

              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of dry beans may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 13(e)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(e) Mature dry bean production to count may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality. Adjustment for excess moisture and quality deficiencies will not be applicable to contract seed beans.</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 18 percent. We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(i) A pick is designated in the Special Provisions and the pick of the damaged production exceeds this designation; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A pick is not designated in the Special Provisions and deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the United States Standards for Beans, result in dry beans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. No. 3 or worse) because the beans are damaged or badly damaged; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net price for the damaged production that is less than the local market price;</P>
              <P>(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</P>
              <P>(iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:</P>
              <P>(A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</P>
              <P>(B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</P>
              <P>(C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</P>
              <P>(v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</P>

              <P>(4) Dry bean production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 13(e) (2) and (3), will be reduced:<PRTPAGE P="335"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) If a conversion factor is designated by the Special Provisions, by multiplying the number of pounds of eligible production by the conversion factor designated in the Special Provisions for the applicable grade or pick; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If a conversion factor is not designated by the Special Provisions as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. If a local market price is not available for the insured crop year, the current years' maximum price election available for the applicable type will be used. The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the market price for the local area to the extent feasible. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver the dry beans to those buyers. Discounts used to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to those that are usual, customary, and reasonable. The price of the damaged production will not be reduced for:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Moisture content;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Damage due to uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Drying, handling, processing, including trading tare for grade to obtain a higher grade and price, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the dry beans; except, if the price of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the price of the production after it has been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production before conditioning;</P>
              <P>(B) The value per pound of the damaged or conditioned production will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment factor; and</P>
              <P>(C) The number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross pounds (if appropriate)) of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment factor to determine the net production to count.</P>
              <P>(f) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage.

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>Assume you have a 100 percent share in 30 acres of type A forage in the unit, with an amount of insurance of $100 per acre. At the time of loss, the following findings are established: 10 acres had a remaining stand of 75 percent of an adequate stand or greater. 20 acres had a remaining stand less than 75 percent but more than 55 percent of an adequate stand.</P>
                <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 20 acres of type B forage in the unit, with an amount of insurance of $90 per acre. 10 acres had a remaining stand of 75 percent of an adequate stand or greater. 10 acres had a remaining stand less than 55 percent of an adequate stand.</P>
                <P>Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>1. 30 acres × $100 = $3,000 amount of insurance for type A;</P>
                <P>20 acres × $90 = $1,800 amount of insurance for type B;</P>
                <P>2. 10 acres with 75% of an adequate stand or greater × $100 = $1,000 for type A;</P>
                <P>10 acres with 75% of an adequate stand or greater × $900 = $900 for type B;</P>
                <P>3. 20 acres with less than 75% but greater than 55% of an adequate stand × $100 × 50 percent = $1,000 for type A;</P>
                <P>0 acres with less than 75% but greater than 55% of an adequate stand × $90 × 50 percent = $0 for type B;</P>
                <P>4. $1,000 + $1,000 = $2,000 reduction for type A;</P>
                <P>$900 + $0 = $900 reduction for type B;</P>
                <P>5. $3,000 − $2,000 = $1,000 for type A</P>
                <P>$1,800 − $900 = $900 for type B</P>
                <P>6. $1,000 × 100 percent share = $1,000 for type A;</P>
                <P>$900 × 100 percent share = $900 for type B;</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the female parent plants in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That are grown under a hybrid seed corn processor contract executed before the acreage reporting date;</P>
              <P>(3) That are planted for harvest as commercial hybrid seed corn in accordance with the requirements of the hybrid seed corn processor contract and the production management practices of the seed company; and</P>
              <P>(4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):</P>
              <P>(i) Planted with a mixture of female and male parent seed in the same row;</P>
              <P>(ii) Planted for any purpose other than for commercial hybrid seed corn;</P>

              <P>(iv) Planted into an established grass or legume.</P>
              <P>(b) An instrument in the form of a “lease” under which you retain control of the acreage on which the insured crop is grown and that provides for delivery of the crop under substantially the same terms as a hybrid seed corn processor contract will be treated as a contract under which you have an insurable interest in the crop.</P>
              <P>(c) A commercial hybrid seed corn producer who is also a seed company may be able to insure the hybrid seed corn crop if the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The seed company has an insurable interest in the hybrid seed corn crop;</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors of the seed company has executed and adopted a corporate resolution that contains the same terms as a hybrid seed corn processor contract. This corporate resolution will be considered a contract under this policy;</P>
              <P>(3) Sales records for at least the previous years' seed production must be provided to confirm that the seed company has produced and sold seed. If such records are not available, the crop may be insured under the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions with a written agreement; and</P>
              <P>(4) Our inspection reveals that the storage and drying facilities satisfy the definition of a seed company.</P>

              <P>(d) Any of the insured crop that is under contract with different seed companies may be insured under separate policies with different insurance providers provided all acreage of the insured crop in the county is insured. If you elect to insure the insured crop with different insurance providers, you agree <PRTPAGE P="341"/>to pay separate administrative fees for each insurance policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>

              <P>(a) Planted and occupied exclusively by male parent plants;</P>
              <P>(b) Not in compliance with the rotation requirements contained in the Special Provisions or, if applicable, required by the hybrid seed corn processor contract; or</P>
              <P>(c) If either the female or male parent plants are damaged before the final planting date and we determine that the insured crop is practical to replant but it is not replanted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, insurance attaches upon completion of planting of:</P>

              <P>(2) The male parent plant seed.</P>
              <P>(b) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the October 31 immediately following planting.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>

              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in section 10(a) (1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of unadapted, incompatible, or genetically deficient male or female parent plant seed;</P>
              <P>(2) Frost or freeze after the date established by the Special Provisions;</P>
              <P>(3) Failure to follow the requirements stated in the hybrid seed corn processor contract and production management practices of the seed company;</P>
              <P>(4) Inadequate germination, even if resulting from an insured cause of loss, unless you have provided adequate notice as required by section 11(b)(1); or</P>
              <P>(5) Failure to plant the male parent plant seed at a time or in a manner sufficient to assure adequate pollination of the female parent plants, unless you are prevented from planting the male parent plant seed by an insured cause of loss.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples of at least one complete planting pattern of the female and male parent plant rows that extend the entire length of each field in the unit. If you are going to destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be harvested, the samples must not be destroyed until after our inspection.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) You must give us notice of probable loss at least 15 days before the beginning of harvest if you anticipate inadequate germination on any unit; and</P>
              <P>(2) You must provide a completed copy of your hybrid seed corn processor contract unless we have determined it has already been provided by the seed company, and the seed company certifies that such contract is used for all its growers without any waivers or amendments.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) You will not receive an indemnity payment on a unit if the seed company refuses to provide us with records we require to determine the dollar value per bushel of production for each variety.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective amount of insurance per acre, by type and variety if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 12(c)(1) if there are more than one type or variety;</P>

              <P>(3) Multiplying the total seed production to count (see section 12(d)) for each type and variety of commercial hybrid seed corn by <PRTPAGE P="342"/>the applicable dollar value per bushel for that type or variety;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total non-seed production to count (see section 12(e)) for each type and variety by the applicable local market price determined on the earlier of the date the non-seed production is sold or the date of final inspection;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of sections 12(c)(3) and 12(c)(4) by type and variety;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(1) if there is only one type or variety, or subtracting the result of 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(2) if there are more than one type or variety; and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(6) by your share. For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development of variety “A” hybrid seed corn in the unit, with an amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $340 (county yield of 160 bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed payment of zero). Your seed production was 1,400 bushels and the dollar value per bushel was $9.80. Your non-seed production was 100 bushels with a local market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 1,400 bushels × $9.80 = $13,720 value of seed production;</P>
              <P>(4) 100 bushel of non-seed × $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production;</P>
              <P>(5) $13,720 + $200 = $13,920;</P>
              <P>(6) $17,000 − $13,920 = $3,080; and</P>
              <P>(7) $3,080 × 100 percent share = $3,080 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development of variety “B” hybrid seed corn in the unit, with an amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $297 (county yield of 140 bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed payment of zero). You harvested 1,200 bushels and the dollar value per bushel for the harvested amount was $8.56. You also harvested 200 bushels of non-seed with a market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee for type “A” and 50 acres × $297 = $14,850 amount of insurance guarantee for type “B”;</P>
              <P>(2) $17,000 + $14,850 = $31,850 amount of insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 1,400 bushels × $9.80 = $13,720 value of seed production for type “A” and 1,200 bushels × $8.56 = $10,272 value of seed production for type “B”;</P>
              <P>(4) 100 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production for type “A” and 200 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $400 of non-seed production for type “B”;</P>
              <P>(5) $13,720 + $200 + $10,272 + $400 = $24,592 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $31,850 − $24,592 = $7,258; and</P>
              <P>(7) $7,258 × 100 percent share = $7,258 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(d) Production to be counted as seed production will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Mature unharvested production with a germination rate of at least 80 percent of the commercial hybrid seed corn as determined by a certified seed test. Any such production may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f);</P>
              <P>(iv) Immature appraised production;</P>
              <P>(v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>

              <P>(2) Harvested production that you deliver as commercial hybrid seed corn to the seed company stated in your hybrid seed corn processor contract, regardless of quality, unless the production has inadequate germination.<PRTPAGE P="343"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Production to be counted as non-seed production will include all harvested or mature appraised production that does not qualify as seed production to count as specified in section 12(d). Any such production may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f).</P>
              <P>(f) For the purpose of determining the quantity of mature production:</P>
              <P>(1) Shelled commercial hybrid seed corn will be:</P>
              <P>(i) Increased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture below 15 percent; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Decreased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 15 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) The weight of ear corn required to equal one bushel of shelled seed corn will be increased 1.5 pounds for each full percentage point of moisture in excess of 14 percent, and any portion of a percentage point will be disregarded. The moisture content of ear corn will be determined from a shelled sample of the ear corn.</P>
              <P>(3) When records of commercial hybrid seed corn production provided by the seed company have been adjusted to a shelled corn basis of 15.0 percent moisture and 56 pound avoirdupois bushels, sections 12(f)(1) and (2) above will not apply to harvested production. In such cases, records of the seed company will be used to determine the amount of production to count, provided that the moisture and weight of such production are calculated on the same basis as that used to determine the approved yield.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your amount of insurance for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>In addition to the requirements contained in section 34 of the Basic Provisions, optional units may be established if each optional unit is:</P>
              <P>(a) Located on non-contiguous land; or</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(a) You may select a separate coverage level for all fresh peach acreage and for all processing peach acreage. For example, if you choose the 55 percent coverage level for all fresh peach acreage, you may choose the 75 percent coverage level for all processing peach acreage.</P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of coverage for fresh peach acreage or processing peach acreage, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured peach acreage in the county of both fresh and processing peaches.</P>
              <P>(2) If you only have fresh peach acreage designated on your acreage report and processing peach acreage is added after the sales closing date, we will assign a coverage level equal to the coverage level you selected for your fresh peach acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) If you only have processing peach acreage designated on your acreage report and fresh peach acreage is added after the sales closing date, we will assign a coverage level equal to the coverage level you selected for your processing peach acreage.</P>
              <P>(b) You may select only one price election for all the peaches in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by fresh and processing peaches. If the Special Provisions allow different price elections, you may select a separate price election for all your fresh peaches and for all your processing peaches. If the Special Provisions do not allow for different price elections, the price elections you choose for fresh peaches and processing peaches must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for fresh and processing peaches. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for fresh peaches, you must choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for processing peaches.</P>
              <P>(c) You must report, not later than the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, separately by fresh and processing peach acreage, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Any event or action that could impact the yield potential of the insured crop including, interplanting of a perennial crop, removal of trees, any tree damage, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing and non-bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of trees, variety, and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance, acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the crop that is interplanted with the peaches;</P>
              <P>(ii) The variety;</P>
              <P>(iii) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Any other reasonable and pertinent information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(d) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any situation listed in sections 3(c)(1) through (4). If the situation occurred:</P>
              <P>(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period, we will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the current crop year as necessary. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance;</P>

              <P>(2) Or may occur after the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to <PRTPAGE P="345"/>establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss;</P>
              <P>(3) Or may occur after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, production lost due to uninsured causes equal to the amount of the reduction in yield used to establish your production guarantee will be applied in determining any indemnity (see section 12(c)(1)(ii). We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year.</P>
              <P>(e) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.</P>

              <P>(3) Are grown on a root stock that is adapted to the area.</P>
              <P>(c) That the crop insured will be any varieties of peaches that are grown for the production of Fresh or Processing Peaches.</P>
              <P>(d) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us;</P>
              <P>(e) That has reached at least the fourth growing season after set out. However, we may agree in writing to insure acreage that has not reached this age if it has produced at least 100 bushels of peaches per acre; and</P>
              <P>(f) That are grown for:</P>
              <P>(1) Fresh peach production; or</P>
              <P>(2) Processing peach production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, peaches interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop to determine the condition of the orchard.</P>
              <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is September 30.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any acreage of peaches on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year and if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>

              <P>(c) Notwithstanding section 9(a)(1) of this section, for each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop <PRTPAGE P="346"/>year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(d) If your peach policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates, whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>
              <P>(3) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(4) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(6) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(7) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken;</P>
              <P>(8) An insufficient number of chilling hours to effectively break dormancy; or</P>
              <P>(9) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Split pits, regardless of cause; or</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the peaches for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples in accordance with our procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), and unless the insurance period has ended prior to each of the following events, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) You must notify us within three days of the date that harvest of the damaged variety should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing unless you have records verifying that the direct market peaches were “weighed and graded” through a packing shed. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(3) If you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), and if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest of the damaged variety, so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so.</P>
              <P>(4) If you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for fresh and processing peaches, as applicable, by the respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production of fresh and processing peaches to be counted, as applicable (see subsection 12(c)) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the total in section 12(b)(5) from the total in section 12(b)(3); and</P>

              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(6) by your share.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>

                <P>You have a 100 percent share in one basic unit with 10 acres of fresh peaches and 5 acres of processing peaches designated on your acreage report, with a 300 bushel per acre production guarantee for both fresh and processing peaches, and you select 100 percent of the price election of $15.50 per bushel for fresh peaches and $6.50 per bushel for processing peaches. You harvest 2,500 bushels of fresh peaches and 500 bushels of processing <PRTPAGE P="347"/>peaches. Your indemnity will be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) 10 acres × 300 bushels = 3,000-bushel production guarantee of fresh peaches;</P>
                <P>5 acres × 300 bushels = 1,500-bushel production guarantee of processing peaches;</P>
                <P>(B) 3,000-bushel production guarantee × $15.50 price election = $46,500 value of the production guarantee for fresh peaches; 1,500-bushel production guarantee × $6.50 price election = $9,750 value of the production guarantee for processing peaches;</P>
                <P>(C) $46,500 value of the production guarantee for fresh peaches + $9,750 value of the production guarantee for processing peaches = $56,250 total value of the production guarantee;</P>
                <P>(D) 2,500 bushels of fresh peach production to count × $15.50 price election = $38,750 value of the fresh peach production to count; 500 bushels of processing peach production to count × $6.50 price election = $3,250 value of the processing peach production to count;</P>
                <P>(E) $38,750 value of the fresh peach production to count + $3,250 value of the processing peach production to count = $42,000 total value of the production to count;</P>
                <P>(F) $56,250 total value of the production guarantee—$42,000 total value of the production to count = $14,250 value of loss; and</P>
                <P>(G) $14,250 value of loss × 100 percent share = $14,250 indemnity payment.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in bushels) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) From which production is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 11.</P>

              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to adequately care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(v) Any appraised production on insured acreage will be considered production to count unless such production is exceeded by the actual harvested production.</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested marketable peach production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) Mature marketable peach production may be reduced as a result of a loss in quality due to an insured cause of loss. The amount of production to count for such peaches will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For fresh peaches by:</P>
              <P>(A) Dividing the value of the damaged peaches minus the post production cost specified in the Special Provisions, by the fresh peach price election; and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(3)(i)(A) (not to exceed 1.00) by the number of bushels of the damaged fresh peaches.</P>
              <P>(ii) For processing peaches by:</P>
              <P>(A) Dividing the value of the damaged peaches minus the post production cost specified in the Special Provisions, by the processing peach price election; and</P>
              <P>(B) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(3)(ii)(A) (not to exceed 1.00) by the number of bushels of the damaged processing peaches.</P>
              <P>(4) Peaches that cannot be marketed due to insurable causes will not be considered production to count.</P>

              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Excessive moisture that prevents harvesting equipment from entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting equipment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>

              <P>(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease <PRTPAGE P="350"/>control measures or as otherwise limited by the Special Provisions;</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Bypassed acreage because of:</P>
              <P>(i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment; or</P>
              <P>(2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the processor contract.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must give us notice:</P>
              <P>(a) Not later than 48 hours after:</P>
              <P>(1) Total destruction of the sweet corn on the unit; or</P>
              <P>(2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested production remains.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after notice is given to us; and</P>
              <P>(c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest, so that we may inspect any damaged production. If you fail to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count. You are not required to delay harvest.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more than one type; and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type A processing sweet corn in the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price election of $50.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 200 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 300 tons × $50.00 price election = $15,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 200 tons × $50.00 price election = $10,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $15,000.00 − $10,000.00 = $5,000.00 loss;</P>
              <P>(7) $5,000.00 × 100 percent = $5,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type B processing sweet corn in the same unit, with a guarantee of 4.0 tons per acre and a price election of $45.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 350 tons. Your total indemnity for both types A and B would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee for type A, and</P>
              <P>100 acres × 4.0 tons = 400 tons guarantee for type B;</P>
              <P>(2) 300 tons × $50.00 price election = $15,000.00 value of guarantee for type A, and</P>
              <P>400 tons × $45.00 price election = $18,000.00 value of guarantee for type B;</P>

              <P>(3) $15,000.00 + $18,000.00 = $33,000.00 total value of guarantee;<PRTPAGE P="351"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) 200 tons × $50.00 price election = $10,000.00 value of production to count for type A, and</P>
              <P>350 tons × $45.00 price election = $15,750.00 value of production to count for type B;</P>
              <P>(5) $10,000.00 + $15,750.00 = $25,750.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $33,000.00 − $25,750.00 = $7,250.00 loss;</P>
              <P>(7) $7,250.00 loss × 100 percent = $7,250.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count, specified in tons of unhusked ear weight, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.</P>
              <P>(iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract.</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested processing sweet corn production from the insurable acreage. The amount of such production will be:</P>
              <P>(i) The usable tons of processing sweet corn shown on the processor settlement sheet, if available; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Determined by dividing the dollar amount paid, payable, or which should have been paid under the terms of the processor contract for the quantity of the sweet corn delivered to the processor by the base contract price per ton; and</P>
              <P>(3) All harvested processing sweet corn production from any other insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract for this unit.</P>
              <P>The total production to count will be expressed as an unhusked ear weight. Any other measure of production will be converted to an unhusked ear weight equivalent.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>A late planting period is not applicable to processing sweet corn unless allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written approval from the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will accept the production from the late planted acres when it is expected to be ready for harvest.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage.

              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions, including:</P>

              <P>(i) Excessive moisture that prevents the harvesting equipment from entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting equipment; and<PRTPAGE P="354"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease on acreage not planted to processing beans the previous crop year. (In certain instances, contained in the Special Provisions or in a written agreement, acreage planted to processing beans the previous year may be covered. Damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures is not covered);</P>
              <P>(5) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(6) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in section 10 (a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Bypassed acreage because of:</P>
              <P>(i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment; or</P>
              <P>(2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the processor contract.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the notice required by section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must give us notice:</P>
              <P>(a) Not later than 48 hours after:</P>
              <P>(1) Total destruction of the processing beans on the unit; or</P>
              <P>(2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested production remains.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after notice is given to us; and</P>
              <P>(c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest. If you fail to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count. You are not required to delay harvest.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more than one type; and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of snap type processing beans in the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price election of $110.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 200 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 300 tons × $110.00 price election = $33,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 200 tons × $110.00 price election = $22,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(4) $33,000.00 − $22,000.00 = $11,000.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(5) $11,000.00 × 100 percent = $11,000.00 indemnity payment.</P>

              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of lima type processing beans in the same unit, with a guarantee of 1.0 ton per <PRTPAGE P="355"/>acre and a price election of $225.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 75 tons. Your total indemnity for both snap and lima types processing beans would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee for the snap type, and 100 acres × 1.0 ton = 100 tons guarantee for the lima type;</P>
              <P>(2) 300 tons × $110.00 price election = $33,000.00 value of guarantee for the snap type, and 100 tons × $225.00 price election = $22,500.00 value of guarantee for the lima type;</P>
              <P>(3) $33,000.00 + $22,500.00 = $55,500.00 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 200 tons × $110.00 price election = $22,000.00 value of production to count for the snap type, and 75 tons × $225.00 price election = $16,875.00 value of production to count for the lima type;</P>
              <P>(5) $22,000.00 + $16,875.00 = $38,875.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $55,500.00 − $38,875.00 = $16,625.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $16,625.00 loss × 100 percent = $16,625.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count, specified in tons, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.</P>
              <P>(iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract.</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested processing bean production from the insurable acreage. The amount of such production will be:</P>
              <P>(i) The usable tons of processing beans shown on the processor settlement sheet, if available; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Determined by dividing the dollar amount paid, payable, or which should have been paid under the terms of the processor contract for the quality and quantity of beans to be delivered to the processor by the base contract price per ton; and</P>
              <P>(3) All harvested processing bean production from any other insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract for this unit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>A late planting period is not applicable to processing beans unless allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written approval from the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will accept the production from the late planted acres when it is expected to be ready for harvest.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>
              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(a) You may select only one coverage level for all fresh apple acreage and only one coverage level for all processing apple acreage. For example, if you choose the 55 percent coverage level for all your fresh apple acreage (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> fresh, varietal group types), you may choose the 75 percent coverage level for all your processing apple acreage. However, <PRTPAGE P="357"/>if you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of insurance for fresh apple acreage or processing apple acreage, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured apple acreage in the county. If you only have fresh apple acreage designated on your acreage report and processing apple acreage is added after the sales closing date, we will assign a coverage level equal to the coverage level you selected for your fresh apple acreage. If you only have processing apple acreage designated on your acreage report and fresh apple acreage is added after the sales closing date, we will assign a coverage level equal to the coverage level you selected for your processing apple acreage.</P>

The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</P>
              <P>(c) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type, if applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Any event or action that could impact the yield potential of the insured crop including interplanted perennial crop, removal of trees, any damage, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;</P>

              <P>In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance from attaching to a crop planted with another crop, apples interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) For the year of application, coverage begins on February 1 of the calendar year the insured crop normally blooms in California and November 21 of the calendar year prior to the calendar year the insured crop normally blooms in all other States. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if your application is received by us after January 12 but prior to February 1 in California, or after November 1 but prior to November 21 in all other States, insurance will attach on the 20th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 20-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the apple acreage.</P>
              <P>(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring an existing policy to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is November 5, or such other date as specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, coverage will not be considered to have begun for a crop year if the policy is canceled or terminated in accordance with section 5(b).</P>

              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. There will be no coverage of any insurable interest acquired after the acreage reporting date.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of apples on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>

              </P>
              <P>(7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(8) Wildlife; and</P>
              <P>(9) All other natural causes of loss that cannot be prevented, including, but not limited to, hail, wind, excess sun causing sunburn, and frost and freeze causing russeting.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to your inability to market the apples for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples in accordance with our procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(1) You must notify us at least 3 days prior to the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(3) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee, by type as applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election and by the percent of price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), for each type as applicable, by the respective price election and by the percent of price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4), if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the total in section 12(b)(5) from the total in section 12(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>Basic Coverage Example:
              </P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in one basic unit with 10 acres of fresh apples and 5 acres of processing apples designated on your acreage report, with a 600 bushel per acre production guarantee for both fresh and processing apples, and you select 100 percent of the price election on a price election of $9.10 per bushel for fresh apples and $2.50 per bushel for processing apples. You harvest 5,000 bushels of fresh apples and 1,000 bushels of processing apples, all grading U.S. No. 1 Processing or better. Your indemnity will be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>A. 10 acres × 600 bushels = 6,000-bushel production guarantee of fresh apples;</P>
              <P>5 acres × 600 bushels = 3,000-bushel production guarantee of processing apples;</P>
              <P>B. 6,000-bushel production guarantee × $9.10 price election × 100 percent of price election = $54,600 value of production guarantee for fresh apples;</P>
              <P>3,000-bushel production guarantee × $2.50 price election × 100 percent of price election = $7,500 value of production guarantee for processing apples;</P>
              <P>C. $54,600 value of production guarantee for fresh apples + $7,500 value of production guarantee for processing apples = $62,100.00 total value of the production guarantee;</P>
              <P>D. 5,000 bushels of fresh apple production to count × $9.10 price election × 100 percent of price election = $45,500 value of fresh apple production to count;</P>

              <P>1,000 bushels of processing apple production to count × $2.50 price election × 100 percent of price election = $2,500 value of processing apple production to count;<PRTPAGE P="360"/>
              </P>
              <P>E. $45,500 value of fresh apple production to count + $2,500 value of processing apple production to count = $48,000 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>F. $62,100 total value of the production guarantee − $48,000 total value of production to count = $14,100.00 value of loss; and</P>
              <P>G. $14,100 value of loss × 100 percent share = $14,100 indemnity payment.</P>

              <P>(iv) Potential marketable apple production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested marketable production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Any apple production not graded or appraised prior to the earlier of the time apples are placed in storage or the date the apples are delivered to a packer, processor, or other handler will not be considered damaged apple production and will be considered production to count.</P>

Assuming you do not sell any of your fresh apple production as U.S. Fancy or better, your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>A. 10 acres × 600 bushels per acre = 6,000-bushel production guarantee of fresh apples;</P>
              <P>B. 6,000-bushel production guarantee of fresh apples × $9.10 price election × 100 percent of price election = $54,600 value of production guarantee for fresh apple acreage;</P>
              <P>C. The value of the fresh apple production to count is determined as follows:</P>
              <P>i. 5,000 bushels harvested − 2,650 bushels that graded U.S. Fancy or better = 2,350 bushels of fresh apple production not grading U.S. Fancy or better;</P>
              <P>ii. 2,350/5,000 = 47 percent of fresh apple production not grading U.S. Fancy or better;</P>
              <P>iii. In accordance with section 14(b)(5)(ii): 47 percent − 40 percent = 7 percent in excess of 40 percent;</P>
              <P>iv. 7 percent × 3 = 21 percent;</P>
              <P>v. 40 percent + 21 percent = 61 percent;</P>
              <P>vi. 5,000 bushels harvested × .61 (61 percent) = 3,050 bushels of fresh apple production not grading U.S. Fancy or better;</P>
              <P>vii. 5,000 bushels harvested − 3,050 bushels of fresh apple production not grading U.S. Fancy or better = 1,950 bushels of adjusted fresh apple production to count;</P>
              <P>viii. 1,950 bushels of adjusted fresh apples production to count × $9.10 price election × 100 percent of price election = $17,745 value of fresh apple production to count;</P>
              <P>D. $54,600 value of production guarantee for fresh apples − $17,745 value of fresh apple production to count = $36,855 value of loss;</P>
              <P>E. $36,855 value of loss × 100 percent share = $36,855 indemnity payment.</P>

              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one price election and coverage level for each crop grown in the county and listed in the Special Provisions that is insured under this policy. If separate price elections are available by type of a crop, the price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type of cling peach, you must choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types of cling peaches.</P>
              <P>(b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type, if applicable, for each stonefruit crop:</P>
              <P>(1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The planting pattern; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(c) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any situation listed in sections 3(b)(1) through (b)(4). If the situation occurred:</P>
              <P>(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the situation was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance;</P>
              <P>(2) Or may occur after the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or</P>
              <P>(3) Or may occur after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, production lost due to uninsured causes equal to the amount of the reduction in yield used to establish your production guarantee will be applied in determining any indemnity (see section 11(c)(1)(ii)). We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all acreage of each stonefruit crop you elect to insure, that is grown in the county, and for which premium rates are provided in the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(a) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(b) That is grown on trees that:</P>

              <P>(5) Have produced at least 200 lugs of fresh market production per acre, or at least 2.2 tons per acre for processing crops, in at least one of the four most recent actual production history crop years, unless we inspect such acreage and give our approval in writing;</P>
              <P>(6) Have, after being set out or grafted, reached at least the fifth growing season. However, we may give our approval in writing to insure acreage that has not reached this age if it meets the requirements of 6(b)(5); and</P>
              <P>(7) Are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, stonefruit interplanted with another perennial crop is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements for insurability contained in your policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) Coverage begins on February 1 in California and November 21 for all other states of each crop year, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after January 22 but prior to February 1 in California or after November 11 but prior to November 21 in all other states, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.</P>
              <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is:</P>
              <P>(i) July 31 for all apricots; and</P>
              <P>(ii) September 30 for all nectarines and peaches;</P>

              <P>(v) As otherwise provided for specific counties or types in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date of acquisition.</P>
              <P>(2) If you lose or relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of stonefruit on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year and if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <P>(c) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(d) If your stonefruit policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates, whichever is the later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;<PRTPAGE P="364"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>
              <P>(3) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(4) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(5) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(6) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in sections 9(a)(1) through (5) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:</P>
              <P>(i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective control mechanism is available;</P>
              <P>(2) Split pits regardless of cause; or</P>
              <P>(3) Inability to market the insured crop for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should have started if the insured crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to section 14 of the Basic Provisions, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must give us notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest. You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we may consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for the type and by the percent of the price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2) (if there is only one type, the result of (3) will be the same as the result of (2));</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 11(c)), for each type, by the respective price election and by the percent of the price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3) (if there is only one type, the result of (6) will be the same as the result of (5)); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>Scenario 1:</P>
              <P>You select 75 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the price election on 50.0 acres of Type A stonefruit with 100 percent share in the unit. The production guarantee is 500.0 lugs per acre and the price election is $6.00 per lug. You harvest 5,000 lugs. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50.0 acres × 500.0 lugs = 25,000-lug production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 25,000 lugs × $6.00 price election × 100 percent of the price election = $150,000 value of production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 5,000 harvested lugs × $6.00 price election × 100 percent of the price election = $30,000 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $150,000-$30,000 = $120,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) 120,000 × 1.000 share = $120,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>Scenario 2:</P>
              <P>In addition to the above information in Scenario 1, you have an additional 50.0 acres of Type B stonefruit with 100 percent share in the unit. The production guarantee is 300.0 lugs per acre and the price election is $3.00 per lug. You harvest 3,000 lugs. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50.0 acres × 500.0 lugs Type A = 25,000-lug guarantee; and 50.0 acres × 300.0 lugs Type B = 15,000-lug guarantee;</P>

              <P>(2) 25,000 lugs × $6.00 price election × 100 percent of the price election = $150,000 value <PRTPAGE P="365"/>of guarantee for Type A; and 15,000 lugs × $3.00 price election × 100 percent of the price election = $45,000 value of guarantee for Type B;</P>
              <P>(3) $150,000 + $45,000 = $195,000 total value of production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 5,000 harvested lugs Type A × $6.00 price election × 100 percent of the price election = $30,000 value of production to count; and 3,000 harvested lugs Type B × $3.00 price election × 100 percent of the price election = $9,000 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(5) $30,000 + $9,000 = $39,000 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $195,000-$39,000 = $156,000 total loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $156,000 loss × 1.000 share = $156,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in lugs or tons) from all insurable acres on a unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production that would be marketable if harvested; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the insured crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us if any further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop. If you harvest the crop we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) The quantity of harvested production will be reduced if the following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The value of the damaged production is less than 75 percent of the marketable value of undamaged production due to an insured cause of loss; and</P>
              <P>(ii) For stonefruit insured as fresh fruit only, the stonefruit either is packed and sold as fresh fruit and meets only the utility grade requirements of the applicable grade standards, or fails to meet the applicable grade standards but is or could be sold for any use other than fresh packed stonefruit.</P>
              <P>(4) Harvested fresh or processing stonefruit production that is eligible for quality adjustment as specified in section 11(c)(3) will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) When packed and sold as fresh fruit or when insured as a processing crop, by dividing the value per lug or ton of marketable production by the highest price election for the same type and multiplying the result (not to exceed 1.00) by the quantity of such production; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For all other fresh stonefruit, by multiplying the number of tons that could be marketed by the value per ton and dividing that result by the highest price election available for the same type.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Unit Division</HD>
              <P>(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, no indemnity will be paid for any loss of production on any unit if the insured produced a crop sufficient to fulfill the processor contracts forming the basis for the guarantee, and any indemnity will be limited to the amount necessary to compensate for loss in yield at the price elected between production to count and the contract requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) In California only, in addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage as provided in the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, optional units may be established if acreage planted to tomatoes is separated by a field that is not planted to tomatoes, or by a permanent boundary such as a permanent waterway, fence, public road or woodland. Such optional unit must consist of the minimum number of acres stated in the Special Provisions. Acreage planted to tomatoes that is less than the minimum number of acres required will attach to the closest unit within the section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one price election for all the processing tomatoes in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type. The percentage of the maximum price election you choose for one type will be applicable to all other types insured under this policy. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</P>
              <P>(b) Liability under this policy will not exceed the number of tons required to be accepted by the processor under a processor contract in effect on or before:</P>
              <P>(1) The earlier of August 20 or the date of damage to the insured crop in all counties with an acreage reporting date of July 15; or</P>
              <P>(2) The earlier of the acreage reporting date or the date of damage in all other counties. (Exclude indemnities that occur in stage one and replant payments.)</P>

              <P>(c) The price election used to determine the amount of an indemnity is progressive by stage and increases, at specified intervals, to the price used for final stage losses. <PRTPAGE P="367"/>Stages will be determined on an acre basis. The stages and applicable price elections are:</P>
              <P>(1) First stage is from planting until first fruit set. If any acreage of the insured crop is destroyed in this stage, the price used to establish the amount of any indemnity owed for such acreage will be 50 percent of your price election;</P>
              <P>(2) Second stage is from the first fruit set until harvest. If any acreage of the insured crop is destroyed in this stage, the price used to establish the amount of any indemnity owed for such acreage will be 80 percent of your price election; and</P>
              <P>(3) Third stage (final stage) is harvested acreage. The price election used in this stage to establish the amount of any indemnity owed will be 100 percent of your price election.</P>
              <P>(d) Any acreage of tomatoes damaged to the extent, that the majority of producers in the area would not normally further care for the tomatoes, will be deemed to have been destroyed even though you may continue to care for it. The price election used to determine the amount of an indemnity will be that applicable to the stage in which the tomatoes were destroyed.</P>
              <P>(e) The appraised production from bypassed acreage that could have been accepted by the processor will be included when determining your approved yield.</P>
              <P>(f) Acreage that is bypassed because it was damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the processor cannot use the product will be considered to have a zero yield when determining your approved yield.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date for California and November 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</HD>
              <P>In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are January 15 in California and March 15 in all other states.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Report of Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before the acreage reporting date in all counties, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Annual Premium</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7 of the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount per acre is determined by multiplying the production guarantee per acre by the price election for the third (final) stage; by the premium rate; by the insured acreage; by the applicable share at the time of planting; and ultimately by any applicable premium adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the tomatoes in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That are planted for harvest as processing tomatoes;</P>
              <P>(3) That are grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements of a processor contract executed on or before August 20 in all counties with an acreage reporting date of July 15, or on or before the acreage reporting date in all other counties, and are not excluded from the processor contract for or during the crop year; and</P>
              <P>(4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):</P>
              <P>(i) Grown on acreage on which tomatoes were grown in either of the two previous years, except in California;</P>
              <P>(ii) Interplanted with another crop; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Planted into an established grass or legume.</P>
              <P>(b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which the tomatoes are grown, you are at risk of loss, and the processor contract provides for delivery of processing tomatoes under specified conditions and at a stipulated price.</P>
              <P>(c) A tomato producer who is also a processor or broker may establish an insurable interest if the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The processor or broker, as applicable, must comply with these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or officers of the processor or the broker must execute and adopt a resolution that contains the same terms as an acceptable processor contract. (Such resolution will be considered a processor contract under this policy); and</P>
              <P>(3) As applicable, our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:</P>

              <P>(a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant; and<PRTPAGE P="368"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions contained in section 11 of the Basic Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases at the earlier of the date:</P>
              <P>(a) You harvest sufficient production to fulfill your processor contract if the processor contract stipulates a specific amount of production to be delivered;</P>
              <P>(b) The tomatoes should have been harvested but was not harvested;</P>
              <P>(c) The tomatoes were abandoned;</P>
              <P>(d) Harvest was completed;</P>
              <P>(e) Final adjustment of a loss was completed; or</P>
              <P>(f) The following calendar date for the end of the insurance period</P>
              <P>(1) October 20 in California; and</P>
              <P>(2) October 10 in all other states.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Excessive moisture that prevents the harvesting equipment from entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting equipment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such acres or the processing of such production being beyond the capacity of the processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(6) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in sections 11(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Acreage being bypassed, if the acreage is bypassed because:</P>
              <P>(i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment;</P>
              <P>(2) The processing tomatoes not being timely harvested, unless such delay in harvesting is solely and directly due to an insured cause of loss; or</P>
              <P>(3) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the processor contract.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Replanting Payment</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a replanting payment is allowed if the crop sustained a loss exceeding 50 percent of the plant stand and it is practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount shown on the Special Provisions multiplied by your share; or</P>
              <P>(2) If an amount is not contained in the Special Provisions, the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or three tons, multiplied by your third stage (final) price election, multiplied by your share; and</P>
              <P>(3) In no event will the replanting payment per acre exceed your actual cost of replanting.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the notice required by section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must give us notice:</P>
              <P>(a) Not later than 48 hours after:</P>
              <P>(1) Total destruction of the tomatoes in the unit; or</P>
              <P>(2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested production remains;</P>
              <P>(b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after notice is given to us; and</P>

              <P>(c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged production. If you fail to notify us and <PRTPAGE P="369"/>such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count. You are not required to delay harvest.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result of section 14(b)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(2) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to counted (see section 14(c)), for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(4) if there are more than one type;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 14(b)(4) from the result of section 14(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the result of section 14(b)(5) from the result of section 14(b)(3) if there are more than one type; and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <FP>For example:</FP>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of type A processing tomatoes in the unit, with a guarantee of 18.8 tons per acre and a price election of $50.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 10.0 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50.0 acres × 18.8 tons = 940.0 tons guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 940.0 tons × $50.00 price election = $47,000.00 value guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10.0 tons × $50.00 price election = $500.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $47,000.00 − $500.00 = $46,500.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $46,500 × 100 percent = $46,500.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of type B processing tomatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 15.0 tons per acre and a price election of $35.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 5.0 tons. Your total indemnity for both types A and B would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50.0 acres × 18.8 tons = 940.0 ton guarantee for type A and 50.0 acres × 15.0 tons = 750.0 ton guarantee for type B;</P>
              <P>(2) 940.0 ton guarantee × $50.00 price election = $47,000.00 value of guarantee for type A and 750.0 ton guarantee × $35.00 = $26,500.00 value of guarantee for type B;</P>
              <P>(3) $47,000.00 + $26,500.00 = $72,500.00 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10.0 tons × $50.00 price election = $500.00 value of production to count for type A and 5.0 tons × $35.00 price election = $175.00 value of production to count for type B;</P>
              <P>(5) $500.00 + $175.00 = $675.00 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $72,500.00 − $675.00 = $71,575.00 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $71,575 loss × 100 percent = $71,575.00 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count, specified in tons, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.</P>

              <P>(iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract;</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandoned, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us, (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested;</P>

              <P>(2) All harvested production (in tons) delivered to the processor which meets the quality requirements of the processor contract (expressed as usable or payable weight).<PRTPAGE P="370"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) All harvested tomato production delivered to processor which does not meet the quality requirements of the processor contract due to not being timely delivered.</P>
              <P>(d) Once harvest has begun on any acreage covered by a processor contract that specifies the number of tons to be delivered, the total indemnity payable will be limited to an amount based on the lesser of the guaranteed tons, or the tons remaining unfulfilled under the processor contract.</P>

              <P>In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all canola and rapeseed in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial table:</P>
              <P>(a) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(b) That is planted for harvest as seed; and</P>
              <P>(c) That is not, unless allowed by Special Provisions or by written agreement:</P>
              <P>(1) Interplanted with another crop; or</P>
              <P>(2) Planted into an established grass or legume.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation requirements contained in the Special Provisions;</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a fall final planting date, any acreage of canola or rapeseed damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a fall type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical;</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates:</P>
              <P>(1) Any fall canola or rapeseed that is damaged before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a fall type of the insured crop to maintain insurance based on the fall type unless we agree that replanting is not practical. If it is not practical to replant to the fall type of canola or rapeseed but is practical to replant to a spring type, you must replant to a spring type to keep your insurance based on the fall type in force; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any fall canola or rapeseed acreage that is replanted to a spring type of the same crop when it was practical to replant the fall type will be insured as the spring type and the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price applicable to the spring type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be considered to be initially planted to the spring type; and</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, any acreage of spring canola or rapeseed damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical; or</P>
              <P>(e) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of fall planted canola or rapeseed is not insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we determine in writing that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance will attach as specified in section 7(e)(3):</P>
              <P>(1) Your request for coverage must include the location and number of acres of fall planted canola or rapeseed;</P>

              <P>(2) The fall planted canola or rapeseed will be insured as a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium<E T="03">,</E> projected price, and harvest price, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting date;</P>
              <P>(4) Any acreage of such fall planted canola or rapeseed that is damaged after it is accepted for insurance but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree it is not practical to replant; and</P>
              <P>(5) If fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as uninsured fall planted acreage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is October 31 of the calendar year in which the crop is normally harvested.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss which occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(a) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(b) Fire;</P>
              <P>(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(e) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(f) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(g) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss specified in sections 9(a) through (g) that also occurs during the insurance period; or</P>

              <P>(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the <PRTPAGE P="372"/>direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Replanting Payment</HD>
              <P>(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(2) Except as specified in section 10(a)(1), you must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions;</P>
              <P>(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage; and</P>
              <P>(4) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that is considered appropriate by agricultural experts for the insured crop, type and practice.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or 175 pounds, multiplied by your projected price, multiplied by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(d) If the acreage is replanted to an insured crop type that is different than the insured crop type originally planted on the acreage:</P>
              <P>(1) The production guarantee, premium, and projected price and harvest price, as applicable, will be adjusted based on the replanted type;</P>
              <P>(2) Replanting payments will be calculated using your projected price and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and insured; and</P>
              <P>(3) A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type, as applicable.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres of each type, as applicable, by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(2) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(1)(i) or 12(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the production to count of each type, as applicable, by your respective:</P>
              <P>(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;</P>
              <P>(4) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(3)(i) or 12(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;</P>
              <P>(5) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(4) from the result of section 12(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(5) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of canola in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 650 pounds, your projected price is $.1220, your harvest price is $.1110, and your production to count is 31,000 pounds.</P>
              <P>If you elected yield protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (650 pound production guarantee × $.1220 projected price) = $3,965.00 value of the production guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 31,000 pound production to count × $.1220 projected price = $3,782.00 value of the production to count</P>
              <P>(5) $3,965.00−$3,782.00 = $183.00</P>
              <P>(6) $183.00 × 1.000 share = $183.00 indemnity; or</P>
              <P>If you elected revenue protection:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × (650 pound production guarantee × $.1220 projected price) = $3,965.00 revenue protection guarantee</P>
              <P>(3) 31,000 pound production to count × $.1110 harvest price = $3,441.00 value of the production to count</P>

              <P>(6) $524.00 × 1.000 share = $524.00 indemnity.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>

              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 12(d)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature canola may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Mature rapeseed may be adjusted for excess moisture only. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.</P>
              <P>(1) Canola and rapeseed production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 8.5 percent. We must be permitted to obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Canola production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in the canola not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 or better (U.S. Sample grade) because of kernel damage (excluding heat damage), or a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss in canola production only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these Crop Provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;</P>
              <P>(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net price for the damaged production that is less than the local market price;</P>
              <P>(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</P>
              <P>(iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality, the samples are analyzed by:</P>
              <P>(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</P>
              <P>(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</P>
              <P>(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</P>
              <P>(v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</P>
              <P>(4) Canola production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 12(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced in accordance with the quality adjustment factors contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on an unadjusted weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>In lieu of section 16(a) of the Basic Provisions, the production guarantee for each acre planted to the insured crop during the late planting period will be reduced by 1 percent per day for each day planted after the final planting date unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Prevented Planting</HD>

              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage.

                <E T="03">Occurrence deductible.</E> This deductible allows a smaller deductible than the crop year deductible to be used when FMVA is more or less than the reported basic unit value. The occurrence deductible is the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) The deductible multiplied by FMVA and:</P>
              <P>(i) In under-report situations, multiplied by the under-report factor; or</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Over-report factor.</E> The factor that adjusts your indemnity for over-reporting of inventory values. This factor is used to determine indemnities when the basic unit value minus the total of all previous losses is more than 110 percent of FMVA for the same basic unit plus the insured value of plants listed on the verifiable sales records. The over-report factor is calculated by:</P>
              <P>(1) The basic unit value minus the total of all previous losses;</P>
              <P>(2) FMVA plus the insured value of plants listed on the verifiable sales records;</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Sales closing date.</E> In lieu of the definition in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, the date shown in the Special Provisions. New-policy applications may be filed at any time. However, all applications, including those for new or amended coverage, are subject to a 30-day waiting period before commencement of coverage as specified in sections 3(d) and 9(a) of these Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Standard nursery containers.</E> Rigid containers that have a minimum dimension greater than or equal to <FR>5/8</FR> inch, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, at the widest point of the container interior, above-ground fabric grow bags, and other types of containers specified in the Special Provisions that are appropriate in size and provide adequate drainage for the plant. In-<PRTPAGE P="376"/>ground fabric grow bags, balled and burlapped, and trays (flats) without individual cells are not considered standard nursery containers.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Stock plants.</E> Plants used solely for propagation during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Survival factor.</E> A value specified in the Special Provisions that denotes the expected percentage of liners that normally survive the period from insurance attachment to market.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Under-report factor.</E> The factor that adjusts your indemnity for under-reporting of inventory values. The factor is always used in determining indemnities. For each basic unit, the under-report factor is the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) 1.000; or</P>
              <P>(2) The basic unit value minus the total of all previous losses; and dividing that result by FMVA.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Wholesale.</E> To sell nursery plants in large quantities at a price below that offered on low-quantity sales to retailers, commercial users, governmental end-users, or other end-users for business purposes (<E T="03">e.g.</E> sales to landscape contractors and commercial fruit producers).

              <P>(B) New nurseries where an inspection has determined you have the ability to properly obtain and maintain the nursery plants.</P>
              <P>(4) If you provide inadequate documentation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> documentation that does not support the amount for which you reported) after insurance attaches for each basic unit, your insurance will not be denied for the crop year. However, your failure to provide adequate documentation may result in a reduction in your indemnity for each basic unit where inadequate documentation was provided.</P>
              <P>(5) For policies insured at the catastrophic risk protection level, you must report, on the PIVR for each practice insured, your greatest plant sales in any of the previous three years and the actual inventory value on the date insurance attaches. For each applicable practice, the total of your basic unit values cannot exceed 110 percent of the higher of your:</P>

              <P>(ii) Actual inventory value on the date insurance attaches</P>
              <P>(d) Your PIVR, including any revised report, and your Peak Inventory Value Report, if applicable, will be used to determine your premium and amount of insurance.</P>
              <P>(e) Your PIVR must reflect your insurable basic unit value.</P>
              <P>(1) The basic unit value you report on your PIVR must be based on the lowest price for each plant size included in the inventory. The inventory value of insured liners must be multiplied by the survival factor.</P>
              <P>(2) In no instance will we be liable for plant values greater than those contained in the EPLPPS.</P>
              <P>(3) If you have previously made a claim and the loss adjuster is unable to determine whether a plant was damaged prior to submission of your PIVR for the current crop year, the plant will be insurable at full value based on the lesser of the Eligible Plant List price or the catalog or price list price. The value of the plant may be reduced at any time during the crop year if the extent of damage is discovered.</P>
              <P>(f) You may increase your reported inventory value for each basic unit no more than twice during the crop year by submitting a revised PIVR prior to 30 days before the end of such crop year.</P>
              <P>(1) Any requested increase must be made in writing and meet all the requirements of the original PIVR.</P>
              <P>(2) We will perform an inspection of the nursery to determine if adequate and acceptable facilities exist to accommodate the requested increased inventory value when the total of all the basic unit values contained on the revised PIVR or Peak Inventory Value Report, if applicable, is increased 50 percent or more from the previous total of all the basic unit values on the PIVR, and the increase is not due to restocking subsequent to an insured loss.</P>
              <P>(3) At our discretion, we may inspect the nursery to determine if adequate and acceptable facilities exist to accommodate the requested increased inventory value if an increase of less than 50 percent is reported on the revised PIVR or Peak Inventory Value Report, if applicable.</P>

              <P>(4) Your revised PIVR will be considered accepted by us and insurance will attach on any proposed increase in inventory value 30 days after your written request is received <PRTPAGE P="378"/>unless we reject the proposed increase in your plant inventory value in writing.</P>
              <P>(5) We will reject any requested increase if a loss occurs within 30 days of the date the request is made (rejection can occur at any time we discover such loss has occurred).</P>
              <P>(6) You cannot revise your PIVR to decrease the plant inventory value after the start of the insurance period specified in section 9.</P>
              <P>(7) Notwithstanding section 6(f), if you have suffered an insured loss on a basic unit and have restocked the nursery, then you are allowed to increase your reported inventory value for the basic unit one additional time by submitting a revised PIVR.</P>
              <P>(g) For insurable plants that were damaged prior to the attachment of insurance coverage:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicable price, as determined in accordance with section 6(e), will be reduced for inventory reporting purposes if we accept such plants for insurance coverage;</P>
              <P>(2) The insurable value of such plants will be removed from the applicable basic unit value reported on the PIVR if they are not accepted;</P>
              <P>(3) The procedure for calculating the insurable value of damaged plants that are accepted for coverage is contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(h) You must report the full value of each basic unit value in accordance with section 6(e). Failure to report the full value of each basic unit value will result in the reduction of any claim in accordance with section 12(d).</P>
              <P>(i) Insurable plants in over-sized containers will be valued for purposes of reporting inventory and loss adjustment as if the plants were in appropriate-sized containers in accordance with the standards contained in the current American Standard for Nursery Stock. Each cell in a multiple-cell container is considered a separate container. (See the EPLPPS on RMA's websitefor additional information and requirements on container specifications and volume calculation.)</P>

              <P>(2) Show an issue date on the cover page (may be handwritten);</P>
              <P>(3) Contain the name, address, and phone number of your nursery;</P>
              <P>(4) Be provided to customers (except printed discount schedules) and used in the sale of your plants; and</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Premium</HD>
              <P>(a) In lieu of section 7(c) of the Basic Provisions, we will determine your premium by multiplying the amount of insurance by the appropriate premium rate, any premium adjustment factor, and the monthly proration factor contained in the actuarial documents. If you elect catastrophic risk protection coverage, this calculation must also be multiplied by fifty-five percent.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions in section 7 of the Basic Provisions, we will prorate your premium based on:</P>
              <P>(1) The time remaining in the crop year after insurance attaches:</P>
              <P>(i) If you have made application after the start of the insurance period specified in section 9; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If you submit a PIVR or catalog after the sales closing date;</P>
              <P>(2) The time remaining in the crop year after insurance attaches and the additional amount of inventory reported, if you submit a revised PIVR to report an increase in inventory value for a basic unit; and</P>
              <P>(3) The time period for which insurance is provided under the Peak Inventory Endorsement.</P>
              <P>(c) Premium will be charged for the entire month for any calendar month during which any amount of coverage is provided under these provisions or the Peak Inventory Endorsement.</P>
              <P>(d) In lieu of section 7(a) of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you apply for insurance before the premium billing date listed in the actuarial documents, the annual premium is earned and payable at the time coverage begins. You will be billed for the premium and administrative fee not earlier than the premium billing date listed in the actuarial documents.</P>
              <P>(2) If you apply for insurance, or submit your PIVR or catalog, on or after the premium billing date listed in the actuarial documents, the premium for the partial crop year will be due and must be paid at the time of application or submission of your PIVR or catalog.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure to pay the premium at the time of application or when you submit your PIVR or catalog will result in no insurance and no indemnity being owed for the crop year.</P>

              <P>Your peak amount of insurance is reduced to zero. Your amount of insurance is reduced by the amount the indemnity exceeds the peak amount of insurance. $64,000 − ($51,000 − $45,000) = $64,000 − $6,000 = $58,000.</P>

              <P>In accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:</P>

              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;<PRTPAGE P="385"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Subtracting the total production to count (See section 10(c)) from the result of section 10(b)(1);</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(2) by your price election; and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(3) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of millet in the unit, with a guarantee of 15 bushels per acre and a price election of $4.00 per bushel. You are only able to harvest 800 bushels. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 15 bushel = 1,500 bushel guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 1,500 bushel guarantee − 800 bushel production to count = 700 bushel loss;</P>
              <P>(3) 700 bushels × $4.00 price election = $2,800 loss; and</P>
              <P>(4) $2,800 × 100 percent share = $2,800 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production (bushels) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Your appraised production will not be less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) Put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with subsection 10(d));</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature millet may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.</P>
              <P>(1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each 0.1 percent point of moisture in excess of 12 percent. We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</P>
              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality, result in the millet weighing less than 50 pounds per bushel; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions and within the insurance period;</P>

              <P>(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The samples are analyzed by a grader or by a laboratory approved by us with regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health (test weight for quality adjustment purposes may be determined by our loss adjuster).</P>
              <P>(4) Millet production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 10(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions if quality adjustment factors are not available in the county, the eligible millet production will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the market price for the local area to the extent feasible.

We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver the millet to those buyers.</P>

              <P>(a) You may select only one price election percentage for each blueberry type designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</P>
              <P>(b) You must report (by type, if applicable) by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) For all types of blueberries: any damage; removal of bushes; change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based; and the number of affected acres; and</P>

              <P>(i) The number of bearing bushes on insurable and uninsurable acreage; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The age of the bushes and the planting pattern.</P>
              <P>(c) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: Removal of bushes; damage to bushes; changes in practices; and any other circumstance that may affect the yield potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>
              <P>(d) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election we offer for the next year if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop is evident prior to the time you request the increase.</P>

              <P>(b) If your blueberry policy is canceled or terminated by us for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates whichever is later, insurance will be considered to have not attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</P>
              <P>(c) We may not cancel your policy when an insured cause of loss has occurred after insurance attached, but prior to the cancellation date. However, your policy can be terminated if a cause for termination contained in sections 2 or 27 of the Basic Provisions exists.</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the blueberries in the county for which a premium rate is provided in the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That are grown on bush varieties that:</P>
              <P>(i) Were commercially available when the bushes were set out or have subsequently became commercially available; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Are varieties adapted to the area of the following types:</P>

              <P>(b) Lowbush blueberry plants (or other types as specified in the Special Provisions) must be pruned every other year to be eligible for insurance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) For the year of application, coverage begins on November 21 of the calendar year prior to the year the insured crop normally blooms, except that, if your application is received by us after November 1, insurance will attach on the twentieth day after your properly completed application is received in our local office unless we inspect the acreage during the 20-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the blueberry acreage.</P>
              <P>(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring an existing policy to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>

              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of insurance period for each crop year is September <PRTPAGE P="388"/>30 for Michigan and September 15 for all other states, unless specified otherwise in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, coverage may not begin for a crop year if the policy is cancelled or terminated in accordance with section 5(b).</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. There will be no coverage of any insurable interest acquired after the acreage reporting date.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of blueberries on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <P>(3) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of blueberries after the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance coverage will be provided for any loss due to an insurable cause of loss that occurred prior to the date that you relinquished your insurable share and the whole premium will be due for such acreage for that crop.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the unit;</P>
              <P>(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;</P>
              <P>(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(6) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(7) An insufficient number of chilling hours to effectively break dormancy;</P>
              <P>(8) Wildlife, unless appropriate control measures have not been taken; and</P>
              <P>(9) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a cause of loss specified in this section that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to install and maintain a proper drainage system;</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to harvest in a timely manner;</P>
              <P>(3) Inability to market the blueberries for any reason other than actual physical damage to the blueberries from an insurable cause specified in this section (for example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production); or</P>
              <P>(4) Mechanical damage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 24 hours if any cause of loss occurs:</P>
              <P>(i) Within 15 days of harvest;</P>
              <P>(ii) When the blueberries are mature and ready for harvest; or</P>
              <P>(iii) During harvest.</P>
              <P>(3) At least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals and acceptable records provided by you will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count that is not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(4) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit as a result of previously reported damage, so that we may inspect the damaged production.</P>
              <P>(b) You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>

              <P>(c) You may be required to harvest a sample, selected by us, to be used for appraisal purposes.<PRTPAGE P="389"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide acceptable production records for any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 10(b)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 10(b)(2) if there is more than one type;</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count for each blueberry type, if applicable, by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 10(b)(4), if there is more than one type;</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 10(b)(5) from the result in section 10(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 10(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Example For Section 10(b)</HD>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 25 acres of highbush blueberries with a production guarantee of 4,000 pounds per acre and a price election of $.45 per pound. You are only able to harvest 62,500 total pounds because adverse weather reduced the yield. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">A. 25 acres × 4,000 pound production guarantee/acre = 100,000 pound total production guarantee;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">B. 100,000 pounds × $.45 price election = $45,000 guarantee;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">C. One type only, so same as (2) above, $45,000;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">D. 62,500 pounds production to count × $.45 price election = $28,125 value of production to count;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">E. One type only, so same as (4) above, $28,125;</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">F. $45,000−$28,125 = $16,875 loss; and</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">G. $16,875 × 100 percent share = $16,875 indemnity payment.</FP>
              <FP>End of Example</FP>
              
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised blueberry production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 9;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvest the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count.</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested mature blueberry production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(d) If you have harvested or unharvested damaged blueberries and the percent of damaged blueberries exceeds that shown in the Special Provisions for that type, production to count for the damaged unit or portion of a unit will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The blueberries from the specific acreage will not be considered production to count if no blueberries are harvested and sold from such acreage;</P>
              <P>(2) For damaged blueberries that are harvested and sold, the production to count for such damaged blueberries will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(i) Subtracting the harvest costs contained in the Special Provisions from the price received for the damaged blueberries;</P>
              <P>(ii) Dividing the result in section 10(d)(2)(i) by the price election; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Multiplying the resulting factor from section 10(d)(2)(ii), not less than zero, by the pounds of damaged blueberries;</P>
              <P>(e) If you have harvested or unharvested damaged blueberries and the percent of damaged blueberries does not exceed that shown in the Special Provisions for that type, the production to count for the damaged unit or portion of a unit will be the appraised or harvested production of blueberries.</P>
              <P>(f) If we determine that frost protection equipment, as shown on your accepted application, was not properly utilized, the indemnity for the affected acreage in the unit will be reduced by the percentage reduction allowed for frost protection equipment as specified in the Special Provisions. You must, at our request, provide us records by date for each period the frost protection equipment was used.</P>

For example, if you harvest production on November 14 but do not sell the production, the average of the AMS prices for the week containing November 14 will be used to determine the market price for the production harvested on November 14; or</P>
              <P>(2) If AMS prices are not published for the week, the average price per pound for in-shell pecans of the same variety or varieties insured offered by buyers on the day you sell any of your pecans, you harvest any of your pecans if they are not sold, or your pecans are appraised if you are not harvesting them, in the area in which you normally market the pecans (If buyers are not available in your immediate area, we will use the average in-shell price per pound offered by buyers nearest to your area).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Unit Division.</HD>
              <P>Except as provided in these Crop Provisions, for both years of the two-year coverage module a unit will be:</P>
              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 34(a)(4) of the Basic Provisions, an enterprise unit if the insured crop is located on at least two parcels of non-contiguous land and at least two of the parcels must contain at least the lesser of 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured crop acreage in the enterprise unit;</P>
              <P>(b) A basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(c) In lieu of the requirements contained in sections 34(b) and (c) of the Basic Provisions, basic units may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit, the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) Each optional unit you select must be located on non-contiguous land;</P>
              <P>(2) Separate records of production are provided for at least the most recent consecutive two crop years. The records will be used to verify that trees from each unit meet the minimum production requirement contained in section 8(d) and to establish the approved average revenue per acre for the optional units selected; and</P>
              <P>(3) Optional units are selected and identified on the acreage report by the acreage reporting date of the first year of the two-year coverage module. Units will be determined when the acreage is reported, but may be adjusted or combined to reflect the actual unit structure when adjusting a loss. No further unit division may be made after the acreage reporting date for any reason.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees and Coverage Levels for Determining Indemnities</HD>
              <P>In lieu of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, the following applies:</P>
              <P>(a) You may select only one coverage level for both years of the two-year coverage module for all pecans in the county. By giving us written notice, you may change the coverage level for the succeeding two-year coverage module not later than the sales closing date of the next two-year coverage module.</P>
              <P>(b) For coverage in excess of catastrophic risk protection, your insurance guarantee for the unit will be determined by multiplying your amount of insurance per acre by the net acres.</P>
              <P>(c) For coverage under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, your insurance guarantee for each unit equals your approved average revenue per acre multiplied by the percentage listed in the Special Provisions and multiplied by the net acres.</P>
              <P>(d) Your amount of insurance per acre will remain the same as stated in the Summary of Coverage on each unit for each year of the two-year coverage module unless:</P>
              <P>(1) You fail to provide acceptable records necessary to determine a loss for optional units. This will result in optional units being adjusted or combined to reflect the actual unit structure at the time of discovery. Your amount of insurance per acre will be recalculated for the current crop year and the subsequent crop year of the two-year coverage module (provided another year remains in the two-year coverage module).</P>
              <P>(2) You increase the previous year's insured acreage by more than 12.5 percent, which will result in the recalculation of your approved average revenue using the sales records for the added acreage. If such sales records are not available for the added acreage, the T-revenue will apply to the added acreage.</P>
              <P>(3) You take any other action that may reduce your gross sales below your approved average revenue, which will result in an adjustment to your approved average revenue to conform to the amount of the reduction in gross sales expected from the action.</P>
              <P>(4) Your gross sales amount is assigned in accordance with section 3(f).</P>
              <P>(e) If you remove a contiguous block of trees from the unit, you must report such removal on your acreage report in accordance with section 6, or within 3 days if removal has occurred after the acreage reporting date, and your insurable acreage will be reduced by the number of acres of trees that have been removed.</P>
              <P>(f) You must report for each unit your gross sales including the amount of harvested and appraised potential production to us for each year of the two-year coverage module on or before the acreage reporting date for the first year of the next two-year coverage module.</P>
              <P>(1) If you do not report your gross sales in accordance with this paragraph, we will assign a gross sales amount for any year you fail to report and you will not be eligible for optional units for both years of the two-year coverage module. The gross sales amount assigned by us will be not greater than the T-revenue for the current coverage module.</P>
              <P>(2) If your gross sales are reported after the acreage reporting date for the two-year coverage module, we will readjust your average gross sales per acre for the next crop year.</P>
              <P>(3) The gross sales or your assigned gross sales amount will be used to compute your sales history for the next two-year coverage module.</P>

              <P>(4) If you filed a claim for any year, the value of harvested production and appraised potential production used to determine your indemnity payment will be the gross sales for that year.<PRTPAGE P="392"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) Hail and fire coverage may be excluded from the covered causes of loss for your insured crop only if you selected additional coverage of not less than 65 percent of your approved average revenue per acre, and you have purchased the same or a higher dollar amount of coverage for hail and fire from us or any other source.</P>
              <P>(h) If you have additional coverage for pecans in the county and the acreage has been designated as “high-risk” by FCIC, you will be able to obtain a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option for the high-risk land under the additional coverage policy and insure the high-risk acreage under a separate Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, provided that the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is obtained from the same insurance provider from which the additional coverage was obtained.</P>
              <P>(i) Any person may sign any document related to pecan crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by this policy provided that person has a properly executed power of attorney or such other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign.</P>

We may revise this information after the contract change date to correct clerical errors.</P>
              <P>(c) The contract change date is October 31 preceding the next two-year coverage module.</P>
              <P>(d) After the contract change date, all changes specified in section 4(b) will also be available upon request from your crop insurance agent. You will be provided, in writing, a copy of the changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, and a copy of the Special Provisions. If changes are made that will be effective for the second year of the two-year coverage module, such copies will be provided not later than 30 days prior to the termination date. If changes are made that will be effective for a subsequent two-year coverage module, such copies will be provided not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date. If available from us, you may elect to receive these documents and changes electronically. For changes effective for subsequent two-year coverage modules, acceptance of the changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of written notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage in accordance with the terms of this policy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Life of Policy, Cancellation and Termination Dates</HD>
              <P>(a) In lieu of section 2(a) of the Basic Provisions, this is a continuous policy with a two-year coverage module and will remain in effect for each subsequent two-year coverage module until canceled by you in accordance with the terms of this policy or terminated by us or by the operation of the terms of this policy.</P>
              <P>(b) In lieu of section 2(c) of the Basic Provisions, after acceptance of your application, you may not cancel or transfer your policy to a different insurance provider during the initial two-year coverage module. Thereafter, the policy will continue in force for each succeeding two-year coverage module unless canceled, terminated, or transferred to a different insurance provider in accordance with the terms of this policy.</P>
              <P>(c) In lieu of section 2(d) of the Basic Provisions, this contract may be canceled by either you or us for the next two-year coverage module by giving written notice on or before the cancellation date.</P>
              <P>(d) Your policy may be terminated before the end of the two-year coverage module if you are determined to be ineligible to participate in any crop insurance program authorized under the Act in accordance with section 2(e) of the Basic Provisions or 7 CFR part 400, subpart U.</P>

              <P>(f) The termination date is January 31 of each crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Report of Acreage</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic Provisions you must report, by the acreage reporting date designated in the Special Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) Any damage to trees, removal of trees, change in practices, sequential thinning or any other action that may reduce the gross sales below the approved average revenue upon which the amount of insurance per acre is based and the number of affected acres;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
              <P>(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern;</P>

              <P>(5) Your gross sales receipts as required under section 3(f).</P>

              <P>(b) We will reduce the amount of your insurable acreage based on our estimate of the removal of a contiguous block of trees or damage to trees of the insured crop. We will <PRTPAGE P="393"/>reduce your amount of insurance per acre based on our estimate of the expected reduction in gross sales from a change in practice or sequential thinning.</P>
              <P>(c) If you fail to notify us of any circumstance stated in section 6(a)(1), we will reduce your insured acreage or your amount of insurance per acre to an amount to reflect the expected reduction of gross sales, as applicable, at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</P>

              <P>(d) That are grown on trees that have produced at least 600 pounds of pecans in-shell per acre (or an amount provided in the Special Provisions) in at least one of the previous four crop years, unless we inspect and allow insurance by written agreement. This amount of production must be achieved subsequent to any top work that occurs within a unit;</P>

              <P>(1) Coverage begins on February 1 of each crop year. However, for the year of application, we will inspect all pecan acreage and will notify you of the acceptance or rejection of your application not later than 30 days after the sales closing date. If we fail to notify you by that date, your application will be accepted unless other grounds exist to reject the application, as specified in section 2 of the Basic Provisions of the application. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.</P>
              <P>(2) For each subsequent two-year coverage module that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior two-year coverage module. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring an existing policy to a different insurance provider for a subsequent two-year coverage module will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.</P>
              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period is January 31 of the crop year.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of pecans on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A request for a transfer of right to an indemnity is submitted by all affected parties and approved by us;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
              <P>(3) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of pecans after the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance coverage will be provided for any loss due to an insurable cause of loss that occurred prior to the date that you relinquished your insurable share and the whole premium will be due for such acreage for that crop year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In lieu of the first sentence of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided against an unavoidable decline in revenue due to the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>

              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or <PRTPAGE P="394"/>unmulched pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>

              <P>(7) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a cause of loss specified in sections 11(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period; or</P>
              <P>(9) Decline in market price;</P>
              <P>(b) If damage occurs before the beginning of the crop year, coverage is only provided if and to the extent the crop was insured the previous crop year;</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the pecans for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Special Provisions permit or you have a written agreement authorizing direct marketing, you must notify us at least 15 days before harvest begins if any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine the dollar value of your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised dollar value of production to count that is not less than the amount of insurance per acre for the direct-marketed acreage if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(c) If you intend to claim an indemnity, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if a loss occurs during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged production.</P>
              <P>(d) You must not sell, destroy or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so.</P>
              <P>(e) If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</P>
              <P>(f) You may be required to harvest a sample, selected by us, to be used for appraisal purposes.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) Indemnities will be calculated separately for each year in the two-year coverage module.</P>
              <P>(b) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable records for any:</P>
              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such records were not provided and this will be the unit structure the current crop year and the subsequent crop year of the two-year coverage module (provided another year remains in the two-year coverage module); or</P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate commingled production or revenue to each basic unit in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>

              <P>(d) The dollar value of the total production to count from all insurable acreage will include:</P>
              <P>(1) The value of all appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than your amount of insurance per acre for acreage:</P>

Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the value of production to count; and</P>

(If the price received is not verifiable by sales receipts or if the pecan production was direct marketed, the market price will be used. Unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions, and excluding pecans sold under contract, the price received will be not less than 95 percent of the lowest AMS price for the nearest location for similar quality, quantity, and variety of in-shell pecans published during the week you sell your pecans. If AMS prices are not published for the week the pecans were sold, the price received will be not less than 95 percent of the lowest price per pound for in-shell pecans of the same variety or varieties insured offered by buyers in the area you normally market the pecans or the area nearest to you if prices are not available in your immediate area on the day you sell your pecans.);</P>

              <P>(c) If there are multiple base contract prices within the same unit, each will be considered a separate price election that will be multiplied by the number of insurable acres under applicable processor contract. These amounts will be totaled to determine the premium, liability, and indemnity for the unit.</P>
              <P>(d) To determine the total production guarantee, apply the lesser of the:</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insured Crop</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all mustard in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial table:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That is planted for harvest as seed;</P>
              <P>(3) That is grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements of a processor contract executed on or before the acreage reporting date and is not excluded from the processor contract at any time during the crop year; and</P>
              <P>(4) That is not, unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement:</P>
              <P>(i) Interplanted with another crop; or</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that a majority of producers in the area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) Insurable acreage will be:</P>
              <P>(1) For acreage only based processor contracts and acreage and production based processor contracts which specify a maximum number of acres, the lesser of:</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Replanting Payment</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a replanting payment is allowed if the insured crop is damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, and it is practical to replant or we require you to replant in accordance with section 8(a).</P>
              <P>(b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee (per acre) or 175 pounds, multiplied by the base contract price applicable to the acreage to be replanted, multiplied by your insured share.</P>
              <P>(c) When the mustard is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment that is attributable to your share. The premium amount will not be reduced.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the representative samples of the unharvested crop that we may require must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis.</P>
              <P>(1) In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(i) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; or</P>

              <P>(ii) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in <PRTPAGE P="398"/>proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(2) For any processor contract that stipulates only the amount of production to be delivered, and not withstanding the provisions of this section or any unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, no indemnity will be paid for any loss of production on any unit if the insured produced a crop sufficient to fulfill the processor contract(s) forming the basis of the insurance guarantee</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insurable acreage of each type, if applicable, determined in accordance with section 8(c), by its respective production guarantee (per acre);</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 13(b)(1) by the respective base contract price for each type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the production to be counted for each type, if applicable (see section 13(c), by its respective base contract price (If you have multiple processor contracts with varying base contract prices within the same unit, we will value your production to count by using your highest base contract price first and will continue in decreasing order to your lowest base contract price based on the amount of production insured at each base contract price);</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the total in section 13(b)(5) from the total in section 13(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 13(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>Example # 1 (with one base contract price for the unit):</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 20 acres of mustard in a unit with a 650-pound production guarantee (per acre) and a base contract price of $0.15 per pound. Due to insurable causes, you are only able to harvest 10,000 pounds and there is no appraised production. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 20 acres × 650 pounds = 13,000 pound production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 13,000 pounds × $0.15 base contract price = $1,950 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) $1,950 total value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 10,000 pounds × $0.15 base contract price = $1,500 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(5) $1,500 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $1,950−$1,500 = $450 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $450 × 100 percent = $450 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>Example # 2 (with two base contract prices for the same unit):</P>
              <P>You have 100 percent share in 20 acres of mustard in a unit with a 650-pound production guarantee (per acre), 10 acres with a base contract price of $0.15 per pound, and 10 acres with a base contract price of $0.10 per pound. Due to insurable causes, you are only able to harvest 8,500 pounds and there is no appraised production. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 10 acres × 650 pounds = 6,500-pound production guarantee × $0.15 base contract price = $975 value guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 10 acres × 650 pounds = 6,500-pound production guarantee × $0.10 base contract price = $650 value guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) $975 + $650 = $1,625 total value guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 6,500 pounds of production to count × $0.15 base contract price (higher base contract price) = $975 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(5) 2,000 pounds of production to count × $0.10 base contract price (lower base contract price) = $200 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $975 + $200 = $1,175 total value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(7) $1,625 total value guarantee—$1,175 total value of production to count = $450 loss; and</P>
              <P>(8) $450 × 100 percent = $450 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage in the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee (per acre) for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 13(d)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>

              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, <PRTPAGE P="399"/>our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested;</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage; and</P>
              <P>(3) Any other uninsurable mustard production that is delivered to fulfill the processor contract.</P>
              <P>(d) Mature mustard may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.</P>
              <P>(1) Mustard production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 10.0 percent. We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</P>
              <P>(2) Mustard production will be eligible for quality adjustment only if:</P>
              <P>(i) Deficiencies in quality result in the mustard not meeting the requirements for acceptance under the processor contract because of damaged seeds (excluding heat damage), or a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</P>
              <P>(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss in mustard production only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 13(d)(2) resulted from a cause of loss specified in section 10 that occurs within the insurance period; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 13(d)(2) result in a salvage price less than the base contract price; and</P>
              <P>(iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 13(d)(2) are made using samples of the production obtained by us, by the processor identified in the processor contract for the insured acreage, or by a disinterested third party approved by us; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The samples are analyzed by a grader in accordance with the Directive for Inspection of Mustard Seed, provided by the Federal Grain Inspection Service or such other directive or standards that may be issued by FCIC.</P>
              <P>(4) Mustard production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 13(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by multiplying the quality adjustment factors contained in the Special Provisions (if quality adjustment factors are not contained in the Special Provisions, the quality adjustment factor is determined by dividing the salvage price by the base contract price (not to exceed 1.000)) by the number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross pounds) of the damaged or conditioned production.</P>
              <P>(i) The salvage price will be determined at the earlier of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(A) Discounts used to establish the salvage price will be limited to those that are usual, customary, and reasonable.</P>
              <P>(B) The salvage price will not include any reductions for:</P>
              <P>(1) Moisture content;</P>
              <P>(2) Damage due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(3) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the mustard; except, if the salvage price can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the salvage price, after the production has been conditioned, by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the salvage price before conditioning; and</P>
              <P>(ii) We may obtain salvage prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain salvage prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such price by the additional costs required to deliver the mustard to those buyers.</P>
              <P>(iii) Factors not associated with grading under the Directive for Inspection of Mustard Seed, provided by the Federal Grain Inspection Service or such other directive or standards that may be issued by FCIC including, but not limited to, protein and oil will not be considered.</P>
              <P>(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on an unadjusted weight basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">14. Late Planting</HD>
              <P>In lieu of section 16(a) of the Basic Provisions, the production guarantee (per acre) for each acre planted to the insured crop during the late planting period will be reduced by 1 percent per day for each day planted after the final planting date, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">15. Prevented Planting</HD>

              <P>Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. When a portion of the insurable acreage within the unit is prevented from being planted, and there is more than one base contract price applicable to acreage in the unit, the lowest base contract <PRTPAGE P="400"/>price will be used in calculating any prevented planting payment. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.</P>

              <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may only select one price election for all the mint in the county insured under this policy unless the actuarial documents provide different price elections by type, in which case you may only select one price election for each type designated in the actuarial documents. The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one specific type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for other types.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you must report:</P>
              <P>(1) The total amount of mint oil produced from insurable acreage for all cuttings for each unit;</P>
              <P>(2) Any damage to or removal of mint plants or stolons; any change in practices; or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the production guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;</P>

              <P>(i) Inspected and accepted by us for the first crop year you are insured; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Certified by you as having an adequate stand on the date coverage begins after the first crop year you are insured unless an inspection is required under section 8(b).</P>
              <P>(b) In lieu of the provisions of section 8 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance of a second crop harvested following the same crop in the same crop year, multiple harvests of mint on the same acreage will be considered as one mint crop.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to the coverages provided in these Crop Provisions, you may also elect the Winter Coverage Option in accordance with section 13.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insurable Acreage</HD>
              <P>(a) Mint interplanted with a cover crop will not be considered interplanted for the purposes of section 9 of the Basic Provisions if the cover crop is destroyed prior to its maturity and is not harvested as grain.</P>

              <P>(1) Does not meet rotation requirements contained in the Special Provisions; or</P>
              <P>(2) Exceeds existing mint age limitations contained in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurance Period</HD>
              <P>In lieu of the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(a) Coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit for acreage with an adequate stand on the following calendar dates:</P>

              <P>(b) For the year of application, for when you have reported planting mint during the Winter Coverage Option insurance period, or for any insurance period following the payment of an indemnity or a reported loss where the crop was determined to not have an adequate stand, we will inspect all mint acreage within the two-week period before coverage begins (If you have elected the Winter Coverage Option, such inspection will occur not later than November 15).</P>
              <P>(1) Insurance will attach on the date coverage begins, as specified in section 8(a), unless we inspect the acreage during the two-week period and determine it does not meet insurability requirements as specified in section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the application, or these Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) You must provide any information we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the crop.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>

              <P>(3) Insects or plant disease (except Verticillium Wilt disease), but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of control measures;<PRTPAGE P="402"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(5) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(6) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured cause of loss listed in sections 9(a)(1) through (6) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production that:</P>
              <P>(1) Occurs after harvest;</P>
              <P>(2) Is due to your failure to distill the crop, unless such failure is due to actual physical damage to the crop caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period; or</P>
              <P>(3) Is due to Verticillium Wilt disease.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>In addition to your duties contained in section 14 of the Basic Provisions, if you discover that any insured mint is damaged, or if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit:</P>
              <P>(a) You must give us notice of probable loss at least 15 days before the beginning of any cutting or immediately if probable loss is discovered after cutting has begun or when cutting should have begun; and</P>
              <P>(b) You must timely harvest and completely distill a sample of the crop on any acreage you do not intend to harvest, as designated by us, to determine if an indemnity is due.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(b) We may defer appraisals until the crop reaches maturity or the date mint harvest is general in the area.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result of section 11(c)(1) by the respective price election for each type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(c)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted (see section 11(d)) of each type, if applicable, by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(c)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 11(c)(5) from the result of section 11(c)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 11(c)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>Assume that you have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of peppermint in the unit, with a production guarantee of 50 pounds of oil per acre and a price election of $12 per pound. Because an insured cause of loss has reduced production, you only harvest and distill 2,500 pounds of peppermint oil. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 50 pounds = 5,000 pound production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 5,000 pound production guarantee × $12 price election = $60,000 value of production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 2,500 pounds production to count × $12 price election = $30,000 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(4) $60,000 − $30,000 = $30,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>(5) $30,000 × 100 percent share = $30,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(d) The total production to count (in pounds of oil) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) For which you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10 of these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(D) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(E) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) All production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) All unharvested production;</P>
              <P>(iv) All potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon with our consent:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you our consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact and provide sufficient care for representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, the amount of production to count will be not less than the production guarantee per acre); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or the appraised production at the time the crop reaches maturity.</P>

              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.<PRTPAGE P="403"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Harvested production must be distilled to determine production to count.</P>
              <P>(f) Any oil distilled from plants growing in the mint will be counted as mint oil on a weight basis.</P>

              <P>(a) The provisions of this option are continuous and will be attached to and made part of your insurance policy if:</P>
              <P>(1) You elect the Winter Coverage Option on your application, or on a form approved by us, on or before the fall sales closing date for the crop year in which you wish to insure mint under this option, and pay the additional premium indicated in the actuarial documents for this optional coverage; and</P>
              <P>(2) You have not elected coverage under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.</P>
              <P>(b) This option provides a production guarantee equal to 60 percent of the production guarantee determined under section 3 of these Crop Provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) If you elect this option, all of the insurable acreage in the county will be insured by this option.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, any acreage of new mint planted after the applicable acreage reporting date must be certified by you and reported to us within two weeks of planting.</P>
              <P>(e) In lieu of section 6(a) of these Crop Provisions, the crop insured will be all mint types in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</P>
              <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
              <P>(2) That are planted for harvest and distillation as mint oil;</P>
              <P>(3) That have an adequate stand on the date coverage begins (newly planted mint types must be reported in accordance with section 8(b) but they must be reported as uninsured unless they have an adequate stand by the date coverage begins); and</P>
              <P>(4) That has been:</P>
              <P>(i) Inspected and accepted by us for the first crop year you are insured (We will inspect all mint acreage and will notify you of the acceptance or rejection of your application not later than November 15. If we fail to notify you by that date, your application will be accepted unless other grounds exist to reject the application, as specified in the Basic Provisions, the application, or these Crop Provisions);</P>
              <P>(ii) Inspected and accepted by us not later than November 15 for the crop year following the payment of an indemnity or a reported loss unless the crop was determined to have an adequate stand (If we determined there was an adequate stand after the loss was reported, no inspection is necessary); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Certified by you as having an adequate stand on the date coverage begins unless an inspection is required under section 13(e)(4)(ii).</P>
              <P>(f) Coverage under this option begins:</P>
              <P>(1) On existing mint acreage with an adequate stand at 12:01 a.m. on the calendar date listed below:</P>

              <P>(iv) For all other states, the date as provided in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) On new mint acreage, that has an adequate stand by the date coverage begins as specified in section 13(f)(1).</P>
              <P>(g) Coverage under this option ends on the unit or part of the unit at 11:59 p.m. on the calendar date listed below:</P>
              <P>(1) June 15 in Indiana, Montana, and Wisconsin;</P>
              <P>(2) May 15 in Washington; and</P>
              <P>(3) For all other states, the date as provided in the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(h) In lieu of section 10(a) of these Crop Provisions, you must give notice of probable loss within 72 hours after you discover any insured mint is damaged and does not have an adequate stand, but no later than the date coverage ends for this option.</P>
              <P>(i) In addition to the requirements of section 10 of these Crop Provisions, you must give us notice if you want our consent to put any mint acreage to another use before a determination can be made if there is an adequate stand on the acreage. We will inspect the acreage and you must agree in writing no payment or indemnity will be made for the acreage put to another use. The total production to be counted for acreage put to another use with our consent in accordance with this section will not be less than the approved yield.</P>
              <P>(j) In addition to section 11(a) of these Crop Provisions we will make a Winter Coverage Option payment only on acreage that had an adequate stand on the date that insurance attached if the adequate stand was lost due to an insured cause of loss occurring within the Winter Coverage Option insurance period and the acreage consists of at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the insurable planted acres in the unit.</P>
              <P>(k) In lieu of section 11(b) of these Crop Provisions, we may defer appraisals until the date coverage ends under this option.</P>
              <P>(l) In lieu of section 11(c) of these Crop Provisions, in the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>

              <P>(1) Multiplying 60 percent by your production guarantee per acre;<PRTPAGE P="404"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result in section 13(l)(1) by the number of acres that do not have an adequate stand;</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplying the result in section 13(l)(2) by the price election; and</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the result in section 13(l)(3) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>Assume that you have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of mint with a production guarantee of 50 pounds of oil per acre and a price election of $12 per pound. Also assume that you do not have an adequate stand on 50 acres by the date coverage ends for this option because an insured cause has damaged the stand. Your Winter Coverage Option payment would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 60 percent × 50 pound production guarantee = 30 pound production guarantee per acre;</P>
              <P>(2) 30 pound production guarantee per acre × 50 acres without an adequate stand = 1,500 pounds;</P>
              <P>(3) 1,500 pounds × $12 price election = $18,000; and</P>
              <P>(4) $18,000 × 100 percent share = $18,000 Winter Coverage Option payment.</P>
              <P>(m) In lieu of section 11(d) of these Crop Provisions, the population of live mint plants to be counted from insurable acreage on the unit will be not less than the population of live mint plants in an adequate stand for acreage:</P>
              <P>(1) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(2) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(3) For which you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 13(h); or</P>
              <P>(4) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes.</P>
              <P>(n) Acreage for which a Winter Coverage Option payment has been made is no longer insurable under the Crop Provisions for the current crop year. Any mint production subsequently harvested from uninsured acreage for the crop year and not kept separate from production from insured acreage will be considered production to count.</P>
              <P>(o) Acreage for which a Winter Coverage Option payment has been made will receive an amount of production of zero when computing subsequent year's approved yield.</P>
              <P>(p) Sections 11(e), (f), and (g) of these Crop Provisions do not apply to this option.</P>

              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</P>

              <P>(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or<PRTPAGE P="406"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted, (see section 11(c) through (d)) by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of cultivated wild rice in the unit, with a guarantee of 400 pounds per acre and a price election of $1.00 per pound. You are only able to harvest 20,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 100 acres × 400 pounds = 40,000 pound guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 40,000 pounds × $1.00 per pound price election = $40,000 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(3) 20,000 pounds × $1.00 per pound price election = $20,000 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(4) $40,000 − $20,000 = $20,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>(5) $20,000 × 100 percent share = $20,000 indemnity payment.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count (finished weight) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>

              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>

              <P>(2) The determined recovery percentage will be used to calculate your loss only if:</P>
              <P>(i) All determined recovery percentages are established using samples of green weight production obtained by us or by the processor for sold or processed production; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The samples are analyzed by an approved laboratory.</P>
              <P>(3) If the conditions of section 11(d)(2) are not met, the standard recovery percentage will be used.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Causes of Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</P>
              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire;</P>
              <P>(3) Wildlife;</P>
              <P>(4) Insects or plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of control measures;</P>
              <P>(5) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(6) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
              <P>(7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a cause of loss specified in sections 10(a)(1) through (6) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to market the cabbage for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period (For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production, etc.); or</P>
              <P>(2) Damage that occurs or becomes evident after the end of the insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that occurs or becomes evident after the cabbage has been placed in storage.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Replanting Payments</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.</P>
              <P>(b) No replanting payment will be made on acreage planted prior to the initial planting date or after the end of the final planting period as designated by the Special Provisions.</P>
              <P>(c) In accordance with the provisions of section 13(c) of the Basic Provisions, the maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre is the number of hundredweight specified in the Special Provisions multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your insured share. The fresh market cabbage price election will be used to determine processing cabbage replanting payments in counties where both fresh market and processing cabbage are insurable.</P>
              <P>(d) When the insured crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment attributable to your share. The premium will not be reduced.</P>
              <P>(e) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit a replanting payment to one each crop year, only one replanting payment will be made for acreage replanted during each planting period within the crop year, if separate planting periods are allowed by the Special Provisions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">12. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
              <P>(a) Failure to meet the requirements of this section will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</P>
              <P>(b) In lieu of the provisions of section 14(b)(1) of the Basic Provisions, so that we may inspect the insured crop, you must give us notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage if such discovery occurs more than 15 days prior to harvest of the acreage.</P>

              <P>(c) In addition to the provisions of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, so that we may inspect the insured crop, you must give us notice:<PRTPAGE P="410"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Immediately if damage is discovered 15 days or less prior to the beginning of harvest or during harvest.</P>
              <P>(2) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, if direct marketing of the insured crop is allowed by the Special Provisions, and you intend to direct market any of the crop.</P>
              <P>(3) At least 15 days before the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(i) The date harvest would normally start if any acreage on the unit will not be harvested; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The beginning of harvest, if any production will be harvested for a use other than as indicated on the acreage report.</P>
              <P>(d) After you have provided the applicable notice required by sections 12(b) and (c), we will conduct an appraisal to determine your production to count for the purposes of section 13(d).</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in section 12(e), you must not dispose of or sell the damaged crop, or store the insured crop, until after we have appraised it and given you written consent to do so.</P>
              <P>(2) If additional damage occurs after this appraisal, except for stored cabbage, we will conduct another appraisal.</P>
              <P>(3) These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count in accordance with section 13(d).</P>
              <P>(e) In accordance with the requirements of section 14(c) of the Basic Provisions, if you initially discover damage to any insured cabbage within 15 days of or during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 3 rows wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit and must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after completion of harvest on the unit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">13. Settlement of Claim</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis.</P>
              <P>(1) In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</P>
              <P>(i) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; and</P>
              <P>(ii) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.</P>
              <P>(2) For any processor contract that stipulates only the amount of production to be delivered, and notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, no indemnity will be paid for any loss of production on any unit if you produced a crop sufficient to fulfill the processor contract(s) forming the basis of the insurance guarantee;</P>
              <P>(b) The extent of any damaged cabbage production must be determined not later than the date the cabbage is placed in storage if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date the cabbage is delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, processor, or other handler if production is not stored.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insurable acreage by its respective production guarantee (per acre), by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 13(c)(1) by the respective price election, by type if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 13(c)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to count of each type, if applicable (see section 13)(d)), by its respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 13(c)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results in section 13(c)(5) from the results of section 13(c)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 13(c)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>For a basic unit you have 100 percent share in 100 acres of cabbage, 50 acres for fresh market and 50 acres for processing as sauerkraut, with a production guarantee (per acre) of 400 hundredweight per acre for fresh market and 400 hundredweight per acre for processing as sauerkraut and a price election of $5.00 per hundredweight for fresh market and $1.90 per hundredweight for processing as sauerkraut. You are only able to harvest 9,000 hundredweight of fresh market cabbage and 9,000 hundredweight of cabbage for sauerkraut because an insured cause of loss has reduced production. Your total indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × 400 hundredweight = 20,000 hundredweight guarantee for the fresh market acreage.</P>
              <P> 50 acres × 400 hundredweight = 20,000 hundredweight guarantee for the processing as sauerkraut acreage.</P>
              <P>(2) 20,000 hundredweight guarantee × $5.00 price election = $100,000 value of guarantee for the fresh market cabbage.</P>
              <P> 20,000 hundredweight guarantee × $1.90 price election = $38,000 value of guarantee for processing as sauerkraut.</P>
              <P>(3) $100,000 + $38,000 = $138,000 total value of guarantee.</P>
              <P>(4) 9,000 hundredweight × $5.00 price election = $45,000 value of production to count for the fresh market acreage.</P>
              <P> 9,000 hundredweight × $1.90 price election = $17,100 value of production to count for the acreage for processing as sauerkraut.</P>
              <P>(5) $45,000 + $17,100 = $62,100 total value of production to count.</P>
              <P>(6) $138,000 −$62,100 = $75,900 loss.</P>

              <P>(7) $75,900 × 100 percent share = $75,900 indemnity payment.<PRTPAGE P="411"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) The total production to count (in hundredweight) of marketable cabbage from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee (per acre) for acreage:</P>

              <P>(C) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(D) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(E) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) All production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) All unharvested marketable production;</P>
              <P>(iv) All potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</P>
              <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</P>
              <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>
              <P>(e) Mature production that is considered damaged cabbage production but is sold will be adjusted for quality as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Dividing the amount received per hundredweight of such damaged cabbage production by the applicable price election; and</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying the result by the number of hundredweight of damaged cabbage production.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">CEO coverage level.</E> The coverage level percentage contained in the actuarial documents where the Coverage Enhancement Option (CEO) is available and selected by you. This percentage is applicable under the combined MPCI/CEO policy when losses under the MPCI policy exceed the deductible and an indemnity is owed.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">CEO dollar amount of insurance.</E> The value of the additional insurance coverage for each unit provided by the CEO, which is determined by multiplying the CEO coverage level by the total value of the insured crop by unit and subtracting the MPCI dollar amount of insurance.</P>
              <P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">MPCI dollar amount of insurance.</E> The value of the insurance coverage for each unit provided under the MPCI policy (the amount of insurance selected by you for dollar or similar plans of insurance, multiplied by the number of acres in the unit if such amount of insurance is on a per acre basis, or the amount determined by multiplying your production guarantee (per acre), times the price election, times the number of acres in the unit).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">MPCI indemnity.</E> The indemnity determined for each unit under the MPCI policy to which CEO is attached, not including replant and prevented planting payments or any indemnity payable under CEO.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">MPCI indemnity factor.</E> A factor determined by dividing the MPCI indemnity by the <PRTPAGE P="412"/>MPCI dollar amount of insurance for each unit. This factor is used to ensure that the indemnity paid under the CEO is proportional to the amount of loss and indemnity paid under the MPCI policy.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Total value of the insured crop by unit.</E> The value of the crop that is determined by dividing the MPCI dollar amount of insurance for each unit by the MPCI coverage level.</P>
              <P>2. CEO is only available for insured crops where the actuarial documents contain a CEO coverage level. If there is a conflict between the terms of CEO and any other provision of your policy, the terms of the CEO will control.</P>
              <P>3. To be eligible for CEO coverage on the insured crop, you must:</P>
              <P>(a) Have an MPCI policy in force for the insured crop (or for citrus fruit, citrus trees, and stone fruit or other crops, as applicable, the insured type) and comply with all terms and conditions of such policy.</P>
              <P>(b) Elect CEO in writing and choose a CEO coverage level (at least 5 percent higher than the MPCI coverage level), by the sales closing date for the insured crop.</P>
              <P>(c) Elect a level of coverage greater than the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) coverage level and a 100 percent price election. CEO is not available for the CAT level of coverage.</P>
              <P>4. CEO is continuous and will remain in effect for as long as you continue to have a MPCI policy in effect for the insured crop, the actuarial documents contain a CEO coverage level, or until it is canceled by you or terminated by us on or before the cancellation or termination date, as applicable.</P>
              <P>5. The premium for your policy will be determined by:</P>
              <P>(a) Totaling the MPCI dollar amount of insurance and the CEO dollar amount of insurance; and</P>
              <P>(b) Multiplying the result of section 5(a) by the premium rate for the insured crop applicable to your MPCI coverage level</P>
              <P>6. With respect to the coverage provided under CEO:</P>
              <P>(a) All acreage of the insured crop insured under your MPCI policy will be covered under the CEO;</P>
              <P>(b) The amount of any replant or prevented planting payment that is payable under the MPCI policy will not be affected by the CEO;</P>
              <P>(c) An indemnity will be payable under the CEO only after the underlying MPCI deductible is met and an MPCI indemnity is paid; and</P>
              <P>(d) The total indemnity for each unit (MPCI coverage plus CEO) cannot exceed the combination of both the MPCI and CEO dollar amounts of insurance.</P>
              <P>7. If you elect CEO and a MPCI indemnity is paid on any unit, CEO will pay a portion of the loss not paid under the deductible of the MPCI policy depending on the CEO coverage level you select (For example, if you selected a 50 percent MPCI coverage level, selected an 85 percent CEO coverage level, and had 60 percent loss of the insured crop, the total amount of indemnity paid under both the MPCI policy and the CEO would be equal to approximately 51 percent of the total value of the insured crop by unit). See the example in section 8.</P>
              <P>8. In addition to the settlement of claim section for the applicable Crop Provisions, your indemnity will be computed for each unit as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Determine the MPCI indemnity factor;</P>
              <P>(b) Determine the total value of the insured crop by unit;</P>
              <P>(c) Determine the CEO dollar amount of insurance; and</P>

              <P>(d) Multiply the MPCI indemnity factor times the CEO dollar amount of insurance to determine the indemnity under the CEO.
              </P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>Assume a policy with one unit; an MPCI coverage level of 50 percent and a CEO coverage level of 85 percent; 100% share; a $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance; and a $72,000 payable indemnity under the MPCI portion of the policy.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) $72,000 MPCI loss ÷ by $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance = .60 MPCI indemnity factor;</P>
              <P>(b) $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance, divided by the MPCI coverage level of .50 results in $240,000 total value of the insured crop by unit;</P>
              <P>(c) $240,000 total value of the insured crop by unit multiplied by the CEO coverage level .85, equals $204,000, and subtracting $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance equals $84,000 CEO dollar amount of insurance;</P>

              <P>(d) .60 MPCI indemnity factor × $84,000 CEO dollar amount of insurance = $50,400 unit indemnity under the CEO.

              <P>(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, is:</P>
              <P>(i) The first November 30th after insurance attaches for early varieties of avocados.</P>
              <P>(ii) The second March 31st after insurance attaches for late varieties of avocados.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage of avocados after coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, and if after inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, then insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any acreage of avocados on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, no premium will be due and no indemnity paid for, such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity or a similar form approved by us is completed by all affected parties;</P>
              <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>

              <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;</P>
              <P>(3) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken;</P>
              <P>(4) Earthquake;</P>
              <P>(5) Volcanic eruption;</P>
              <P>(6) Failure of the irrigation water supply caused by an insured peril specified in section 9(a)(1) through (5) that occurs during the insurance period.</P>
              <P>(7) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures; and</P>
              <P>(8) Plant disease, but not due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
              <P>(1) Theft; or</P>
              <P>(2) Inability to market the avocados for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production, etc.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss.</HD>
              <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:</P>
              <P>(a) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing.</P>
              <P>(1) We will conduct a preharvest appraisal that will be used to determine your production. If damage occurs after the preharvest appraisal, and you can provide acceptable records to us that account for all production removed from the unit after our appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal that will be used to determine your production.</P>

              <P>(2) Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised production to count of not less than the production guarantee per <PRTPAGE P="415"/>acre if such failure results in an inability to make an accurate appraisal.</P>
              <P>(b) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest so that we may inspect the damaged production.</P>
              <P>(1) You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so.</P>
              <P>(2) If you fail to meet the requirements of this subsection, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we may consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as production to count.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim.</HD>
              <P>(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide production records:</P>
              <P>(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; or</P>
              <P>(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
              <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for each type, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);</P>
              <P>(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted (see section 11(c)) by type, if applicable, by the respective price election;</P>
              <P>(5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);</P>
              <P>(6) Subtracting the results in section 11(b)(5) from the results in section 11(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>For example:</P>
              <P>You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of early variety A in the unit, with a guarantee of 140 bushels per acre and a price election of $16.00 per bushel. You are only able to harvest 6,000 bushels due to an insured cause of loss. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 50 acres × 140 bushels = 7,000 bushel guarantee;</P>
              <P>(2) 7,000 bushels × $16.00 price election = $112,000.00 value of guarantee;</P>
              <P>(4) 6,000 bushels × $16.00 price election = $96,000.00 value of production to count;</P>
              <P>(6) $112,000.00 − $96,000.00 = $16,000 loss; and</P>
              <P>(7) $16,000 × 100 percent = $16,000 indemnity.</P>
              <P>(c) The total production to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10 of these Crop Provisions;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production;</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to adequately care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</P>

              <P>(6) Subtracting the result in section 10(b)(5) from the result in section 10(b)(3); and</P>
              <P>(7) Multiplying the result in section 10(b)(6) by your share.</P>
              <P>(c) The total forage seed production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</P>
              <P>(1) All appraised production as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
              <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
              <P>(B) That is put to another use without our consent;</P>
              <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</P>
              <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us.</P>
              <P>(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Unharvested production; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached and if:</P>
              <P>(A) You do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisals made prior to giving consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count);</P>
              <P>(B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
              <P>(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage in accordance with section 10 (e).</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the provisions of section 15 of the Basic Provisions, we may determine the amount of production of any unharvested forage seed on the basis of our field appraisals conducted after the normal time of harvest for the area. If the acreage is later harvested, production records must be provided and if the harvested production exceeds the appraised production, the claim will be adjusted.</P>
              <P>(e) Production not meeting the minimum quality requirements contained in the forage seed contract or certifying agency's standards based on tests conducted by a qualified seed testing laboratory due to insurable causes will be reduced as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Divide the actual value by the base price for the insured type; and</P>

              <P>(2) Multiply the result (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of pounds of such production.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>You have a 100 percent share and 100 acres of forage seed in the unit, with a guarantee of 600 pounds per acre on 75 acres of an established stand of forage seed and a guarantee of 300 pounds per acre on 25 acres of a spring planted seed-to-seed year stand. All acreage is contracted with a base price of $1.20 per pound and you have selected 100 percent of the base price. Losses due to insured causes of loss have reduced production and quality and you only harvested 37,000 pounds of seed. A portion of the total production was of poor quality; 10,000 pounds of seed failed to achieve the contract minimum germination requirement; and the salvaged production was valued at $0.80 per pound. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) 75 acres × 600 pounds = 45,000-pound guarantee</P>
                <P>25 acres × 300 pounds = 7,500-pound guarantee;</P>

                <P>(2) 45,000 pounds × $1.20 per pound price election = $54,000 value guarantee<PRTPAGE P="419"/>
                </P>
                <P>7,500 pounds × $1.20 per pound price election = $9,000 value guarantee;</P>
                <P>(3) $54,000 + $9,000 = $63,000 total value of the guarantee;</P>
                <P>(4) 27,000 pounds met the contract quality requirements = 27,000 pounds production to count</P>
                <P>27,000 pounds × $1.20 per pound = $32,400 10,000 pounds × ($0.80 per pound/$1.20 per pound) = 6,667 pounds production to count</P>
                <P>6,667 pounds × $1.20 per pound = $8,000;</P>
                <P>(5) $32,400 + $8,000 = $40,400 total value of production to count;</P>
                <P>(6) $63,000 − $40,400 = $22,600 loss; and</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Unit Division</HD>
            <P>(a) Unless limited by the Special Provisions, a basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit, you meet the following:</P>

            <P>(1) All optional units you select for the crop year are identified on the acreage report for that crop year (Units will be determined when the <PRTPAGE P="420"/>acreage is reported but may be adjusted or combined to reflect the actual unit structure when adjusting a loss. No further unit division may be made after the acreage reporting date for any reason);</P>
            <P>(2) You have records that are acceptable to us for at least the most recently completed crop year for all optional units that you will report in the current crop year (You may be required to produce the records for all optional units for the most recently completed crop year);</P>
            <P>(3) You have records of marketed or stored production from each optional unit maintained in such a manner that permits us to verify the production from each optional unit, or the production from each optional unit is kept separate until loss adjustment is completed by us.</P>
            <P>(b) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following conditions, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) Be of a different type; or</P>
            <P>(2) Consist of acreage located on non-contiguous land.</P>
            <P>(c) Subsections (a) and (c) of section 34 of the Basic Provisions do not apply to these Crop Provisions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</HD>
            <P>In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
            <P>(a) You may select only one coverage level for all the avocados in the county insured under this policy.</P>
            <P>(b) You must report, on or before the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by unit:</P>
            <P>(1) Any damage, stumping (including the year or years that the stumping was performed), or removal of trees; change in orchard practices; or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield per acre to less than the approved yield and the number of affected acres and trees;</P>
            <P>(2) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</P>
            <P>(3) The age of the trees;</P>
            <P>(4) Any acreage excluded under section 6 of these Crop Provisions; and</P>
            <P>(5) For acreage interplanted with another crop:</P>
            <P>(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</P>
            <P>(ii) The planting pattern; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Any other information we request to establish your approved yield per acre.</P>
            <P>(c) We will reduce the approved yield whenever we determine any one or more of the factors specified in this section are likely to have a negative impact upon that average yield. If you fail to provide complete and accurate information required by this section, and pursuant to the definition of approved yield, we will reduce that yield as necessary at any time we become aware of any such omission.</P>
            <P>(d) In the event the avocado trees are damaged to the extent that we determine the APH history you certified no longer is representative of the potential production of the unit, we will reduce your approved yield to a level consistent with that reduced potential. Such reduction will not occur for a crop year for which insurance already has attached if the damage is due to a cause of loss that is insurable for the avocado fruit.</P>
            <P>(e) In lieu of that specific provision in section 3(f) of the Basic Provisions, you are required to report the production for the crop year that ended on the October 31 immediately preceding the cancellation date. For example, you must report your production for the 2008 crop year by the production reporting date for the 2010 crop year. All other provisions of section 3(f) apply.</P>
            <P>(f) When you initially apply for insurance:</P>
            <P>(1) You must certify your production records for at least the most recently completed crop year;</P>

            <P>(2) If you do not certify your production records for any one or more of the three crop years immediately prior to the most recently completed crop year, you will be assigned a percentage of the transitional yield included in the actuarial documents for that crop year. The percentages will be those described in 7 CFR part 400 subpart G. All other provisions of 7 CFR part 400 subpart G apply.<PRTPAGE P="421"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
            <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is the August 31 that precedes the cancellation date.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</HD>
            <P>In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are the November 30 immediately prior to the first day of the crop year.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Insured Crop</HD>
            <P>(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the avocados in the county grown on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided:</P>
            <P>(1) In which you have a share;</P>
            <P>(2) That is grown for harvest as avocado fruit for commercial sale;</P>
            <P>(3) That is a type identified in the actuarial documents;</P>
            <P>(4) That is irrigated; and</P>
            <P>(5) That is grown on trees that, if inspected, are considered acceptable to us.</P>
            <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 8 of the Basic Provisions that identify an uninsurable crop, we do not insure any avocados produced on trees that have not reached the sixth growing season after set out unless the unit has produced an average of at least 2,000 pounds of avocados per acre in one of the most recent three crop years or as otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
            <P>(c) Avocado trees that have been stumped are not insurable for three calendar years after the year stumping was performed. The calendar year stumping occurred will be considered to be the actual calendar year if performed between January 1 and June 30 of that year. It will be considered to be the following calendar year if performed between July 1 and December 31.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Insurable Acreage</HD>
            <P>(a) In lieu of that part of section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibits insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, avocados interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements of insurability contained in these Crop Provisions.</P>
            <P>(b) In addition to the acreage designated as not insurable in section 9 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure avocados produced on any acreage infected with Phytophthora root rot unless you follow good orchard management practices as recommended by agricultural experts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insurance Period</HD>
            <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) Coverage begins on December 1st of the crop year.</P>
            <P>(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the second October 31st of the crop year.</P>
            <P>(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, and if we inspect and consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.</P>
            <P>(2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any acreage of avocados on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to such acreage for that crop year unless:</P>
            <P>(i) A transfer of right to an indemnity or a similar form approved by us is completed by all affected parties;</P>
            <P>(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</P>
            <P>No premium will be due or indemnity paid unless a properly executed transfer of right to an indemnity has been filed with us.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Causes of Loss</HD>
            <P>(a) In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided against unavoidable loss of production due to the following causes of loss occurring within the insurance period:</P>
            <P>(1) Adverse weather conditions;<PRTPAGE P="422"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</P>
            <P>(3) Insects and disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of control measures;</P>
            <P>(4) Wildlife;</P>
            <P>(5) Earthquake;</P>
            <P>(6) Volcanic eruption; or</P>
            <P>(7) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to an insured cause of loss specified in sections 9(a)(1) through (6).</P>
            <P>(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:</P>
            <P>(1) Theft;</P>
            <P>(2) Phytophthora root rot, if you do not maintain cultural practices to minimize the potential for damage due to this pathogen; or</P>
            <P>(3) Inability to market the avocados for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market any avocado fruit due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept such fruit.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</HD>
            <P>In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
            <P>(a) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an inspection and appraisal, if needed, that will be used to determine your production to count for such production. If damage occurs after this inspection, we will conduct one or more additional inspections as needed. These inspections, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice as required will result in production to count determined as described in section 11(c) if we are not able to determine the amount of such production;</P>
            <P>(b) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us immediately so we may inspect the unit. You must not sell or otherwise dispose of any damaged production until we have given you written consent to do so, or 15 days, whichever is earlier. If you fail to meet the requirements of this subsection all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count;</P>
            <P>(c) We will not perform any appraisals of potential production earlier than the July that follows the bloom for the crop year; and</P>
            <P>(d) You must notify us immediately if you intend to stump 10 percent or more of the trees on a unit after insurance has attached for the crop year.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">11. Settlement of Claim</HD>
            <P>(a) We will determine your loss separately for each unit you defined on your acreage report or that we find to exist in accordance with section 2 of these Crop Provisions. If you do not or cannot provide acceptable records of production for the crop year for:</P>
            <P>(1) Any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such records were not provided; or</P>
            <P>(2) Any basic unit, we will allocate commingled production to each basic unit in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</P>
            <P>(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</P>
            <P>(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;</P>
            <P>(2) Subtracting from the result of section 11(b)(1) the total production to count (see section 11(c);</P>
            <P>(3) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(2) by the price election, by the price election factor, and by your share.</P>
            <P>(c) The total production to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include the value of all appraised and harvested production, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Appraised production to be counted will include:</P>
            <P>(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</P>
            <P>(A) That is abandoned;</P>
            <P>(B) That is sold or otherwise disposed by direct marketing if you failed to provide the notice required by section 10 and we were not able to determine the amount of such production;</P>

            <P>(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or<PRTPAGE P="423"/>
            </P>
            <P>(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;</P>
            <P>(ii) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes;</P>
            <P>(iii) Unharvested marketable production (the quantity of such production may be reduced as described in section 11(d));</P>
            <P>(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you agree to our appraisal of such production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised production is not reached:</P>
            <P>(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. The production to count for such acreage will be based on the greater of the harvested production or our appraisal in accordance with Section 15(b) of the Basic Provisions from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the production to count; or</P>
            <P>(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the production to count for the acreage will be based on the greater of harvested production or our reappraisal in accordance with section 15(b) of the Basic Provisions if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</P>
            <P>(2) All marketable harvested production (the quantity of such production may be reduced as described in section 11(d)). Any production that is not marketable due to an insured cause of loss will not be included in the production to count.</P>
            <P>(d) The quantity of appraised and harvested marketable production may be reduced if the production is considered to be a No. 2 avocado and the price of such marketable production is less than 75 percent of the maximum price election. The quantity of such production will be multiplied by an adjustment factor equal to the lesser of 1.00 or the price of the damaged avocados divided by the maximum price election.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Amount of insurance.</E> For each basic unit, your inventory value multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elect, and multiplied by your share. However, for catastrophic risk protection policies, amount of insurance is your inventory value multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elect (for CAT coverage the level is limited to 50 percent), multiplied by your share, and multiplied by 55 percent. Your accumulated paid indemnities during the crop year for each basic or optional unit may not exceed your amount of insurance.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Basic unit value before loss.</E> The stage value of all undamaged insurable clams, in the basic unit or, if elected, all optional units combined, immediately prior to the occurrence of any loss as determined by our appraisal. This allows the amount of insurance under the policy to be prorated among the individual units based on the actual value of the clams in the unit at the time of loss. It is also the basis for determining whether or not an indemnity is due. This value is used to ensure that you have not under-reported your clam inventory value.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Clam.</E> A cultivated <E T="03">Mercenaria mercenaria</E> (quahog).</P>

Pollution will also include any increase or decrease in the content of any normal soluble or insoluble constituent of water including mud and silt, feed residues, solid or liquid fish wastes, dissolved gases and any other substance normally present in the water of the lease parcel.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Practical to replant.</E> In lieu of the definition of “Practical to replant” contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, unless limited by the Special Provisions, practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to the causes of loss listed in section 10 of these provisions, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop to develop normally during the remainder of the crop year. Unavailability of seed clams will not be considered a valid reason for failure to replant.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Practice.</E> The cultural methods of producing clams such as trays, mesh bags, round pens, lantern nets or bottom planting.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Replant.</E> Unless limited by the Special Provisions, performing the cultural practices necessary to prepare for replacement of insurable clams that were destroyed by an insurable cause of loss and then placing living insurable clams into mesh bags or pens, or seeding them into prepared growout beds, bottom culture, bottom trays, or floating trays on insurable acreage.</P>

              <E T="03">Stage.</E> Clams that have attained the size or age specified for stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 as defined in the Special Provisions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Stage value.</E> The dollar value of the inventory of all insurable clams at each stage based on the survival factors and the prices shown in the actuarial documents for such stages, in <PRTPAGE P="426"/>each unit on your inventory value report, including any revision that increases the value of your insurable inventory.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Storm surge.</E> A significant increase or decrease in water depth relative to normal tides that is caused by a strong, continuous and prolonged strong flow of onshore or offshore winds.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Survival factor.</E> A factor shown on the actuarial documents that represents the expected percentage of clams that will normally survive. If you provide production records for three consecutive years, your records will be used in lieu of the factor contained in the actuarial document to determine the survival factor. The survival factor is applied at the time of inventory and is not applied a second time to the same inventory when a loss occurs. Clams that are seeded subsequent to the annual inventory value report must be adjusted by the survival factor.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Tidal wave.</E> A large water wave, wave train, or a series of waves, generated in a body of water by an impulsive disturbance that vertically displaces the water column or a destructive type of wave motion in seas and oceans, associated with either strong winds or underwater earthquakes.</P>

This is used to determine the loss of value for each individual unit so that losses can be paid on an individual unit basis, optional or basic, as applicable.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Unit value before loss.</E> The stage value of undamaged insurable clams in the basic or optional unit, as applicable, immediately prior to the loss occurrence. The determined value will include the number of seeded and harvested clams and stages that existed on the date of the inventory value report, adjusted for changes in accordance with subparagraph 22A(2) of the Insurance Standards Handbook, including but not limited to; the reference maximum dollar amount contained in the actuarial documents; and the applicable survival factors. This allows the amount of insurance under the policy to be divided among the individual units in accordance with the value of the clams in the unit at the time of loss for determining whether you are entitled to an indemnity for insured losses in the unit, optional or basic, as applicable. Clams that are seeded subsequent to the annual inventory value report being submitted must be adjusted by the survival factor before they are added to the beginning inventory during the process of establishing the “Unit value before loss.”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Unit Division</HD>
            <P>(a) In addition to the definition of basic unit contained in section 1 of the Basic</P>
            <P>Provisions, a basic unit may be divided into optional units in accordance with section 2(b). Note that even if you elect optional unit coverage, amount of insurance, crop year deductible, under-report factor, premium, and the total amount of indemnity payable under this policy will be controlled by the basic unit value before loss.</P>
            <P>(b) If you elect the additional level of coverage, for an additional premium, inventory that would otherwise be a basic unit may, unless limited by the Special Provisions, be divided into optional units by non-contiguous lease parcels. Additional optional units may also be authorized in the Special Provisions. If you elect optional units, you must provide separate inventory reports for each unit and keep all records of seeding, harvest, and uninsured losses separately by unit.</P>

            <P>(c) Failure to keep or report separate records will result in all optional unit inventories under a basic unit being combined in a basic unit at loss time.<PRTPAGE P="427"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) If you elect optional units, your amount of insurance will be divided among optional units in relation to unit value before loss of clams in each optional unit. If, at the time of loss, the aggregate value of the clams in your optional units exceeds your basic unit inventory value, you will be subject to the under-report factor provisions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Amount of Insurance</HD>
            <P>(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may only select one coverage level percentage for all clams, regardless of their stage, insured under this policy.</P>
            <P>(b) Your amount of insurance will be reduced by the amount of any indemnity paid under this policy.</P>
            <P>(c) For an additional premium, you may increase your amount of insurance in accordance with section 6(d).</P>
            <P>(d) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.</P>
            <P>(e) For seeded clams, the amount of insurance is the product of the reference maximum dollar amount of insurance and the fraction of the maximum value associated with the applicable stage multiplied by the coverage level selected multiplied by your share.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Contract Changes</HD>
            <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is August 31 of each year, or as specified in the actuarial documents.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</HD>
            <P>In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are November 30, or as specified in the actuarial documents.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Clam Inventory Value Report</HD>
            <P>In lieu of section 6 of the Basic Provisions:</P>
            <P>(a) For insurance to attach for the crop year, you must submit an inventory value report to us with your application and for each subsequent crop year, not later than November 30 preceding the crop year, or by the date specified in the Special Provisions.</P>
            <P>(b) The inventory value report must be submitted yearly and include, for each basic or optional unit all growing locations, the stages of the clams and the stage values, and your share by growing location.</P>
            <P>(1) The inventory value must also reflect the stages as shown in the Special Provisions.</P>
            <P>(2) At our option and at any time, you may be required to provide documentation in support of any of your reports, including, but not limited to, a detailed listing of growing locations, unit values, the numbers and the sizes of clams seeded or placed for grow-out; your share, sales of clams and purchases of seed clams for the 3 previous crop years, and of your ability to properly obtain and maintain clams.</P>
            <P>(3) For catastrophic level policies only, you must report your clam sales for the previous crop year on the clam inventory value report. You may be required to provide documentation to support such sales.</P>
            <P>(c) Your inventory value report, including any revised report, will be used to determine your premium and amount of insurance.</P>
            <P>(d) If allowed for in the Special Provisions you may revise your inventory value report to increase the reported inventory value. We may inspect the inventory. Your revised inventory value report, if allowed by the Special Provisions, will be considered accepted by us and coverage will begin on any proposed increase in inventory value at the later of December 1, the date shown in the Special Provisions, or 30 days after your written request is received by us, unless we reject the proposed increase in your inventory value in writing. We will reject any requested increase if a loss occurs before the later of December 1, the date shown in the Special Provisions, or within 30 days of the date the request is made.</P>
            <P>(e) Failure to report the full value of your stage value will result in the reduction of any claim in accordance with section 14(d).</P>

            <P>(f) For catastrophic insurance coverage only: Your inventory value report for all clams cannot exceed the lesser of the value from section 6(b) or the percent shown on the actuarial documents of your previous year's <PRTPAGE P="428"/>sales of clams unless you provide acceptable records to prove your actual inventory value.</P>
            <P>(g) Your inventory value report must reflect your insurable clam inventory according to the prices contained in the actuarial documents. In no instance will we be liable for values greater than those contained in the actuarial documents.</P>
            <P>(h) You must report all clams on the unit including any clams owned or subleased by other individuals or entities.</P>
            <P>(i) No application or inventory value reports, except revisions, will be accepted after November 30, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Premium</HD>
            <P>(a) In lieu of section 7(c) of the Basic Provisions, we will determine your premium by multiplying the amount of insurance by the appropriate premium rate and by the premium adjustment factors listed on the actuarial documents.</P>
            <P>(b) Additional premium from an increase in the inventory value report is due and payable when we accept the revised inventory value report.</P>
            <P>(c) In addition to the provisions in section 7 of the Basic Provisions, the premium will be adjusted for partial crop years for the year of seeding and for clam leases you acquire. Premium will be charged for the entire month, as shown in the actuarial documents, for any month during which any amount of coverage is provided.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Insured Crop</HD>
            <P>In lieu of the provisions of section 8 and section 9 of the Basic Provisions, the insured crop is all the clams in the county that:</P>

            <P>Assume you have a 100 percent share, the inventory value reported by you is $100,000, and your coverage level is 75 percent. Your amount of insurance is $75,000 ($100,000 × .75). At the time of loss, unit value before loss is $95,000, unit value after loss is $30,000 and basic unit value before loss is $100,000. The deductible percentage is 25 percent (100−75), the crop year deductible is $25,000 (.25 × $100,000). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
            <P>Step (1) Determine the under-report factor; $100,000 ÷ $95,000 = 1.000;</P>
            <P>Step (2) Determine the occurrence deductible; .25 × $95,000 × 1.000 = $23,750;</P>
            <P>Step (3) Calculate the difference between unit value before loss and unit value after loss; $95,000−$30,000 = $65,000;</P>
            <P>Step (4) Result of step 3 multiplied by the underreport factor (step 1); $65,000 × 1.000 = $65,000;</P>
            <P>Step (5) Result of step 4 minus the occurrence deductible; $65,000−$23,750 = $41,250;</P>
            <P>Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share; $41,250 × 1.000 = $41,250 indemnity payment.</P>

            <P>Assume you have a 100 percent share, the inventory value reported by you is $100,000, and your coverage level is 75 percent. You have two optional units, unit 1 and unit 2. Your amount of insurance is $75,000 ($100,000 × .75). You have a loss on unit 1 and no loss on unit 2. At the time of loss, unit value before loss on unit 1 is $60,000, unit value after loss on unit 1 is $18,000 and basic unit value before loss is $125,000. The deductible percentage is 25 percent (100−75), the crop year deductible is $25,000 (.25 × $100,000). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</P>
            <P>Step (1) Determine the under-report factor; $100,000 ÷ $125,000 = .80;</P>
            <P>Step (2) Determine the occurrence deductible; .25 × $60,000 × .80 = $12,000;</P>

            <P>Your crop year deductible is reduced to $13,000 ($25,000−$12,000). Your amount of insurance is reduced to $53,400 ($75,000−$21,600). You do not restock unit 1 after the first loss. Values on unit 2 do not change from those measured at the time of the loss on unit 1. Assume you have a loss later in the crop year on unit 2. Unit value before loss on unit 2 is $65,000, unit value after loss on unit 2 is $0.00 and basic unit value before loss on the basic unit is $83,000.

              <P>(2) Non-profit scientific or educational organizations whose purposes and interests are complementary to <PRTPAGE P="440"/>the mission of the USNA and which substantially support the mission and purpose of the USNA (e.g., Friends of the National Arboretum, National Bonsai Foundation, National Capital Area Federation of Garden Clubs, Herb Society of America) may be exempted from the fee for use of USNA facility or grounds requirement of this subpart by the Director, but still must reimburse the USNA for its costs, including setup, clean-up, security, and other costs as applicable.</P>
              <P>(3) A Half Day usage is defined as 4 hours or less; a Whole Day usage is defined as more than 4 hours in a day. In all cases, usage includes all time during which a venue is committed, including time used to set up before and clean up after an event.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reservations.</E> (1) Facilities and grounds are available by reservation at the discretion of the Director of the USNA and may be available to individuals or groups for uses that are consistent with the mission of the USNA. Agency initiatives may be granted first priority. Offices and hallways inside secured doors will not be available for use.</P>
              <P>(2) Reservations to use USNA facilities and grounds may be made directly with the USNA. To ensure consideration, reservation requests should be made as far in advance as possible with a minimum of 15 calendar days prior to the date of use required for all reservations. This advanced notice will provide the USNA adequate time to prepare sites and assign staff and supervision as necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) The USNA will make every effort to respond to requests in a quick and timely fashion. The USNA will respond to reservation requests within 5 working days with information as to whether the requested site is available for use. The USNA will also give notice to the prospective user of any planned activities (construction, maintenance, pesticide applications, and any similar activities) that might affect the planned use or event.</P>
              <P>(4) A 50 percent non-refundable deposit will be due at the time of a booking in order to reserve a specific date and location. The remaining 50 percent is due five working days prior to the event.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Terms and conditions of use.</E> (1) The USNA provides space, water, and electrical hookup when available, and restrooms where available. Users must provide all tents, tables, chairs, trash receptacles, or other property required for the scheduled event. Users must remove all trash from the property at the conclusion of the event. Users must remove all tents, tables and chairs, and other property no later than 5:00 p.m. of the day following the event. The USNA will charge a facility use and break down fee of $500.00 per day for each day following the deadline to remove temporary facilities and equipment. The USNA will not store temporary facilities or equipment for users.</P>
              <P>(2) Users must abide by USNA vehicle regulations in § 500.11 including the requirement to obtain USNA approval whenever off road access is required for setup.</P>
              <P>(3) The USNA will not assume any responsibility for last minute changes due to failure of current mechanical systems, severe storms and other weather events, emergencies relating to security and safety.</P>
              <P>(4) Some events that involve bringing animals and certain plants onto the USNA property may not be compatible with the plant research, display, and education mission of the USNA. Such events will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and exceptions may be made by the Director of the USNA.</P>
              <P>(5) Music and bands will be permitted but the decibel level of music should not be loud enough to be heard outside the boundaries of the USNA.</P>

              <P>(6) (i) A refundable deposit as specified in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section for use of the facility or grounds, excluding the classroom, will be collected in advance. In the event of building, property, or grounds damage or excessive cleaning requirements, the deposit will be used for repair and remediation and the balance will be refunded within 30 days of the event date. <PRTPAGE P="441"/>In the event that cleaning requirements or damage to the building, property or grounds exceeds the amount of the refundable deposit, the deposit will be used in full, with additional charges billed and due within 30 days of billing. Damages to plants, grounds, facilities, or equipment will be assessed on a value based on replacement costs, including labor.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Multitrack processing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When ARS has a significant number of requests, the nature of which precludes a determination within 20 working days, the requests may be processed in a multitrack processing system, based on the date of receipt, the amount of work and time involved in processing the request, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(b) ARS may establish as many processing tracks as appropriate; processing within each track shall be based on a first-in, first-out concept, and rank-ordered by the date of receipt of the request.</P>

            <P>These procedures assure that research and other activities of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) comply with the intent of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and appropriate regulations implementing this Act. These procedures incorporate and supplement, and are not a substitute for, CEQ regulations under 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and Department <PRTPAGE P="452"/>of Agriculture NEPA Policies and Procedures under 7 CFR part 1b. ARS conducts and supports research as authorized by legislation to support one of the USDA goals of assuring adequate supplies of high quality food and fiber. Information generated through such research often forms the basic data needed to assess the impact of a new technology upon the environment. Large scale projects simulating commercial practices are normally implemented in cooperation with other agencies of the Federal or State Governments.</P>

            <P>(c) Environmental documents may be substituted or combined with other reports which serve to facilitate decisionmaking.</P>
            <P>(d) Costs of analyses and environmental documents are to be planned for during the budgetary process for the plan, program, or project. Special provisions for financing NEPA process activities which are unanticipated and extraordinary may be made in the Office of the Administrator of ARS.</P>
            <P>(e) ARS personnel will cooperate with other agencies, States, contractors, or other entities proposing to undertake activities involving the ARS to assure that NEPA considerations are addressed early in the planning process to avoid delays and conflicts as required by 40 CFR 1501.2.</P>
            <P>(f) For some activities, project participants outside ARS may be required to provide data and documentation. When an applicant or contractor prepares an environmental assessment (EA) or a contractor prepares an environmental impact statement (EIS), the activities shall be carried out according to 40 CFR 1506.5.</P>
            <P>(g) Environmental documents, decision notices, and records of decision must be made available for review by the public. There shall be an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the environmental analysis process (40 CFR 1501.7).</P>
            <P>(h) The concepts of tiering to eliminate repetitive discussions applicable to EIS's (40 CFR part 1502) are also applicable to EA's.</P>
            <P>(i) ARS personnel may adopt an existing EA or EIS when a proposed action is substantially the same as the action for which the existing EA or EIS was prepared (40 CFR 1506.3 (b)).</P>
            <P>(j) ARS personnel may incorporate by reference any existing documents in order to reduce the bulk of an EA or EIS (40 CFR 1502.21).</P>
            <P>(k) After prior consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, ARS personnel may forego preparation of an EA or EIS in emergency situations (40 CFR 1506.11).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For the following categories of actions, the preparation of an EA or EIS is not required:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Department of Agriculture categorical exclusions (7 CFR 1b.3).</E> (1) Policy <PRTPAGE P="453"/>development, planning and implementation which are related to routine activities such as personnel, organizational changes or similar administrative functions;</P>
            <P>(2) Activities which deal solely with the functions of programs, such as program budget proposals, disbursement, transfer or reprogramming of funds;</P>
            <P>(3) Inventories, research activities and studies, such as resource inventories and routine data collection when such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity;</P>
            <P>(4) Educational and information programs and activities;</P>
            <P>(5) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other agencies, public and private entities, and</P>
            <P>(6) Activities related to trade representation and market development activities overseas.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">ARS categorical exclusions.</E> ARS actions which, based on previous experience, have been found to have limited scope and intensity and produce little or no individual or cumulative impacts to the human environment. Some examples are:</P>
            <P>(1) Repair, replacement of structural components or equipment, or other routine maintenance of facilities controlled in whole or in part by ARS;</P>
            <P>(2) Research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term effects on the environment. Examples are:</P>
            <P>(i) Research operations conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse or other contained facility where research practices and safeguards prevent environment impacts such as the release of hazardous materials into the environment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Inventories, studies or other such activities that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes in the environment;</P>
            <P>(iii) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which does not involve the use of control agents requiring containment or a special license or a permit from a regulatory agency.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions to categorical exclusions.</E> An environmental assessment shall be prepared for an activity which is normally within the purview of categorical exclusion if there are extraordinary circumstances which may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA).</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Actions requiring EA.</E> The following actions would normally require an EA:</P>
            <P>(1) Programs, supported in the majority by ARS, which may assist in the transition of a particular technology from field evaluation stage to large-scale demonstration or simulated commercial phase;</P>
            <P>(2) Field work having an impact on the local environment such as earth excavation, explosives, weather modifications, or other such techniques; and</P>
            <P>(3) The testing outside the laboratory, such as small isolated field plots, of control agents which require containment precautions or either a special license or a permit from a regulatory agency.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple agencies actions.</E> If more than one Federal agency participates in a program activity, the EA shall be prepared by the lead agency as provided in 40 CFR 1501.5.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Format and conclusion.</E> An EA can be in any format provided it covers in a logical and succinct fashion the information necessary for determining whether a proposed Federal action may have a significant environmental impact and thus warrant preparation of an EIS. The EA will contain the information required by 40 CFR 1508.9. This information will include brief discussions of the need for the project or other proposal, alternatives, environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Decision notice.</E> Upon completion of an EA, the responsible official will consider the information it contains, decide whether an EIS is required or that no significant environmental impact will occur, and will document the decision and the reasons for it. The decision and the EA shall be available to the public in a manner appropriate to the situation. If there is a finding of no significant impact, the EA may be combined with the decision notice.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Actions requiring EIS.</E> An EIS will normally be prepared for:</P>
            <P>(1) Proposals for legislation which are determined to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment; or,</P>
            <P>(2) Other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In the experience of ARS, an environmental impact statement shall normally be required in situations when a research project has advanced beyond the laboratory and small plot testing to full scale field testing over a very large area and involving the introduction of control agents.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of intent.</E> If the responsible official recommends the preparation of an EIS, then the public shall be apprised of the decision. This notice shall be prepared according to 40 CFR 1508.22.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Draft and final EIS.</E> The process of preparing the draft and final EIS, as well as the format, shall be according to 40 CFR parts 1502-1506.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Decisionmaking and implementation.</E> The responsible official may make a decision no sooner than thirty days after the notice of availability of the final EIS has been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by the Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 1506.10). The decision will be documented in a Record of Decision required by 40 CFR 1502.2, and monitoring and mitigation activities will be implemented as required by 40 CFR 1505.3.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Formation of non-assistance cooperative agreements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In lieu of 2 CFR 200.201 through 200.204, 200.206, and 200.306, this section establishes project development, resource contributions, indirect cost reimbursement, and tuition remission provisions for non-assistance cooperative agreements.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Project development.</E> REE Agencies provide partial funding to cooperators to support research projects that contribute to REE program objectives and help carry out the REE mission. The project must consist of a project plan and/or statement of work, and a budget as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Project plan.</E> A <E T="03">project plan</E> must be jointly developed by the Agency PI and the cooperator, and be compliant with a REE program requirement. The REE Agency may include program-specific requirements, as applicable. These requirements should be aligned with Agency strategic goals, strategic objectives, or performance goals that are relevant to the program.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Statement of work.</E> A detailed <E T="03">statement of work</E> must be jointly planned, developed, and prepared by the cooperator's PI and the Agency PI to address the objective(s), approach, statement of mutual interest, performance responsibilities (which may include specific performance goals, indicators, milestones, or expected outcomes, such as outputs, or services performed or <PRTPAGE P="457"/>public impacts of any of these, with an expected timeline for accomplishment), and any mutual agreements.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Budget.</E> The <E T="03">budget</E> is a funding plan that must be jointly developed by the Agency PI and the Cooperator PI. The approved budget must identify the cooperator resource contributions, both direct and indirect, by budget line item. The cooperator must provide a budget justification/narrative.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Resource contributions.</E> Each party must contribute resources towards the successful completion of the non-assistance cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Agency resource contributions.</E> The <E T="03">Agency's contribution</E> is the Federal share as reflected in the award.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cooperator resource contributions.</E> The <E T="03">Cooperator's contribution</E> may consist of funds, services, or in-kind contributions, must be no less than 20 percent of the total funding provided by the REE Agency, and cannot fall below 20 percent of the total Federal funding throughout the period of performance. All cooperator contributions must consist of a sufficient amount of itemized direct costs to demonstrate a true stake in the project, as determined by the ADO. All contributions must be documented in the budget and be consistent with the cooperator's institution classification of costs.</P>
            <P>(i) Cooperator resource contributions must meet all of the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(A) Are verifiable from the Cooperator's records;</P>
            <P>(B) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;</P>
            <P>(C) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project or program objectives;</P>
            <P>(D) Are allowable under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E;</P>
            <P>(E) Are not paid by the Federal government under another Federal award, except where the Federal statute authorizing a program specifically provides that Federal funds made available for such program can be applied to cooperator resource contributions of other Federal programs;</P>
            <P>(F) Conform to other provisions of this Part, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(ii) Cooperator's share of contributions to the project may include:</P>
            <P>(A) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs of the cooperator's resource contributions. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the award and the amount which could have been charged to the award under the cooperator's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.</P>

            <P>(B) Values for cooperator's contributions of services and property, established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.434. If the REE Agency authorizes the cooperator to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long term use, the value of the donated property for cooperator contributions must be the lesser of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section (refer to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H) of this section for more on the value of donated property):</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the cooperator's accounting records at the time of donation.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the REE Agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section at the time of donation.</P>
            <P>(C) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor, if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the cooperator. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the cooperator, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the cooperator competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable may be included in the valuation. (Refer to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H) of this section for more on third-party in-kind contributions.)</P>

            <P>(D) Donated employee services furnished by third-party organization. These services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an <PRTPAGE P="458"/>amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally negotiated indirect cost rate, or, a rate in accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(d), provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made. (Refer to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H) of this section for more on third-party in-kind contributions.)</P>
            <P>(E) Donated property from third parties, which may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated property included in the cooperator contributions must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. (Refer to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H) in this section for more on third-party in-kind contributions.)</P>

            <P>(F) Third-party-donated equipment, buildings and land. The method used for determining cooperator contributions for which title passes to the cooperator may differ according to the purpose of the Award, if paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section apply:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the non-Federal entity in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cooperator resource contributions.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the purpose of the Award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the REE Agency has approved the charges. See also 2 CFR 200.420.</P>
            <P>(G) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the cooperator, with the following qualifications:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the Cooperator as established by an independent appraiser (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the cooperator as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) (Uniform Act) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.</P>
            <P>(H) For third-party in-kind contributions, the fair market value of these goods and services must be documented and to the extent feasible supported by the same methods used internally by the cooperator.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Indirect costs and tuition remission</E>—(1) <E T="03">Reimbursement of indirect costs.</E> Reimbursement of indirect costs is either prohibited or limited as further described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, and the limit is identified on the approved budget, when applicable.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">State cooperative institutions.</E> Payment of indirect costs to State cooperative institutions in connection with a non-assistance cooperative agreement is prohibited, as described in 7 U.S.C. 3319. This prohibition does not apply to funds for international agricultural programs conducted by a State cooperative institution and administered by the Secretary, or to funds provided by a Federal agency for such cooperative program or project through a fund transfer, advance, or reimbursement.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-profit organizations.</E> Payment of indirect costs to non-profit organizations in connection with a non-assistance cooperative agreement is limited to 10 percent of the total direct cost of <PRTPAGE P="459"/>the Award. (Annual Appropriations Bill for Agriculture and Related agencies, General Provisions.)</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">All other cooperating entities.</E> With the exception of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, payment of indirect costs is allowable in connection with a non-assistance cooperative agreement. Reimbursement of indirect costs is limited to the percentage(s) established in the cooperator's approved negotiated indirect cost rate or, if applicable, the de minimis indirect cost rate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Tuition remission.</E> Reimbursement of tuition expenses to State cooperative institutions in connection with non-assistance cooperative agreements is prohibited. (7 U.S.C. 3319)</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> The Agency may impose award-specific terms and conditions or require additional assurances when appropriate.</P>

              <P>(a) The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354, 7 U.S.C. 6901 note) and established by Secretary's Memorandum 1010-1 (2.b.6), <E T="03">Reorganization of the Department of Agriculture,</E> to provide national leadership in the conservation, development, and productive use of the Nation's natural resources. Such leadership encompasses the conservation of soil, water, air, plant, and animal resources with consideration of the many human (economic and sociological) interactions. NRCS is the Federal agency that works with landowners on private lands to help them conserve their natural resources. NRCS employees are highly skilled in many scientific and technical specialties, including soil science, soil conservation, agronomy, biology, agroecology, range conservation, forestry, engineering, geology, hydrology, wetlands science, cultural resources, and economics. NRCS was formerly the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) which was established by the Soil Conservation Act of 1935 (Pub. L. 74-46, 49 Stat. 163 (16 U.S.C. 590 (a-f))). NRCS has responsibility for three major areas:</P>
              <P>(1) Soil and water conservation;</P>
              <P>(2) Natural resource surveys including soil surveys, resources inventory, snow surveys, and water supply forecasting; and</P>
              <P>(3) Community resource protection and management including watershed projects, river basin studies and investigations, resource conservation and development areas, land evaluation and site assessment, and emergency watershed protection. In addition, NRCS has leadership for the Wetlands Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative, Farmland Protection Program, Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, Forestry Incentives Program, and Conservation Farm Option. NRCS provides technical support for the Conservation Reserve Program.</P>
              <P>(b) The NRCS organization consists of a National Headquarters located in Washington, DC; six regional offices; 50 state offices and two equivalent offices in the Caribbean Area and the U.S. Trust Territories of the Pacific Basin Area; approximately 2,500 field offices and 300 specialized offices; 26 plant materials centers; 17 major land resource area soil survey offices; nine national centers; and seven national institutes. A Chief who reports to the USDA Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment heads NRCS.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Functions assigned.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the Federal agency that works with private landowners to conserve their natural resources. NRCS employees help land users and communities approach conservation planning and implementation with an understanding of how natural resources relate to each other and to people—and how human activities affect those resources. The agency emphasizes voluntary, science-based assistance, partnerships, and cooperative problem solving at the community level. The mission of NRCS is to work on the Nation's non-Federal lands to conserve, improve, and sustain natural resources. The following functions support the mission.</P>
              <P>(a) NRCS facilitates and provides conservation technical assistance at the local level that helps people assess their natural resource conditions and needs, set goals, identify programs and other resources to address those needs, develop proposals and recommendations, implement solutions, and measure their success. The agency's role is to assist with:</P>
              <P>(1) Resource inventories,</P>
              <P>(2) Resource assessments,</P>
              <P>(3) Planning assistance, and/or</P>
              <P>(4) Technical assistance.</P>
              <P>(b) NRCS provides technical assistance through local conservation districts to land users, communities, watershed groups, Federal and State agencies, other partners, and customers.</P>
              <P>(c) NRCS provides assistance on a voluntary basis.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency's work focuses on soil, water, air, plant, and animal conservation including erosion reduction, water quality improvement, wetland restoration and protection, fish and wildlife habitat improvement, range management, stream restoration, water management, and other natural resource issues.</P>
              <P>(e) Through the conservation operations program, NRCS maintains a cadre of conservationists and interdisciplinary technical experts who provide landowners with advice and recommendations. Science based procedures and techniques are based on new knowledge and research provided by the Agricultural Research Service and others. NRCS developed and maintains a system of directives—including manuals, handbooks, and technical references—to institutionalize new methods, procedures, and standards used to deliver technical assistance at the field level.</P>
              <P>(f) NRCS has general responsibility for administration of the following programs:</P>
              <P>(1) Conservation operations, authorized by the Soil Conservation Act of 1935 and the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977. Activities include:</P>

              <P>(i) Conservation technical assistance to land users, communities, units of State and local government, and other Federal agencies in planning and implementing natural resource solutions to reduce erosion, improve soil and water quantity and quality, improve and conserve wetlands, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, improve air quality, improve pasture and range conditions, reduce upstream flooding, and improve woodlands. Assistance is also provided to implement the highly erodible land (HEL) and wetland conservation (Swampbuster) provisions and—on a reimbursable basis—the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the 1985 Food Security Act, as amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 and Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. NRCS technical field staff make HEL and wetland determinations and assist land users to develop and implement conservation plans needed <PRTPAGE P="469"/>to ensure compliance with the law. NRCS is also the lead Federal agency for delineating wetlands on agricultural lands for purposes of implementing both the provisions of the Food Security Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) Soil surveys that provide the public with local information on the uses and capabilities of their soil resource. Soil surveys are based on scientific analysis and classification of the soils and are used to determine land capabilities and conservation treatment needs. Surveys are conducted cooperatively with other Federal agencies, land grant universities, State agencies, and local units of government. NRCS is the world leader in soil classification and soil mapping, and is expanding into soil quality.</P>
              <P>(iii) Snow survey and water supply forecasts that provide western States and Alaska with vital information and forecasts of seasonable variable water supplies. NRCS field staff in cooperation with partnering organizations manually collect data from 850 remote high mountain sites. Data is electronically collected from an additional 600 SNOTEL (automated snowpack telemetry network) sites. In cooperation with the National Weather Service, the data is assembled and analyzed. Then, NRCS staff develop seasonal water supply forecasts.</P>
              <P>(iv) Plant Material Centers that assemble, test, and encourage increased plant propagation and usefulness of plant species for biomass production, carbon sequestration, erosion reduction, wetland restoration, water quality improvement, streambank and riparian area protection, coastal dune stabilization, and to meet other special conservation treatment needs. The work is carried out cooperatively with State and Federal agencies, private organizations, commercial businesses, and seed and nursery associations. After species are proven, they are released to the private sector for commercial production.</P>
              <P>(v) National Resources Inventory (NRI) that is a statistically-based survey designed and implemented using scientific principles to assess conditions and trends of soil, water, and related resources on nonfederal lands in the United States. The NRI captures data on land cover and use, soil erosion, prime farmland, wetlands, habitat diversity, selected conservation practices, and related attributes at thousands of scientifically selected sample sites in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and some Pacific Basin locations.</P>
              <P>(2) Conservation programs in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, most of which are funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). NRCS provides leadership and technical assistance for the following programs:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).</E> EQIP provides a single, voluntary conservation program for farmers and ranchers who face serious threats to soil, water, and related natural resources. Nationally, it provides technical, financial, and educational assistance, half of it targeted to livestock-related natural resource problems and half to more general conservation priorities.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP).</E> WRP is a voluntary program to restore and protect wetlands on private property. It provides an opportunity for landowners to receive financial incentives to restore wetlands in exchange for retiring marginal agricultural land.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP).</E> WHIP is a voluntary program for people who want to develop and improve wildlife habitat on private lands. It provides both technical assistance and cost sharing to help establish and improve fish and wildlife habitat.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Farmland Protection Program (FPP).</E> This program provides funds to help purchase development rights to keep productive farmland in agricultural use. Working through existing programs, USDA joins with State, tribal, or local governments to acquire voluntary conservation easements or other interests from landowners.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Forestry Incentives Program (FIP).</E> FIP supports good forest management practices on privately owned, non-industrial forest lands nationwide. FIP is designed to benefit the environment while meeting future demands for wood products. Although not funded by CCC, Section 373 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 <PRTPAGE P="470"/>extended the program under discretionary appropriations.</P>
              <P>(3) Resource Conservation and Development (RC&amp;D) Program, authorized by Section 102 of the Flood and Agriculture Act of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-702) and Sections 1528-1538 of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-98). This program is initiated and directed at the local level by volunteers who involve multiple communities, various units of government, municipalities, and grassroots organizations. RC&amp;D is a catalyst for civic-oriented groups to share knowledge and resources in a collective attempt to solve common problems. The program offers aid in balancing the environmental, economic, and social needs of an area.</P>
              <P>(4) Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) and other responsibilities assigned under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-87). Under RAMP, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to landowners to reclaim certain abandoned coal-mined lands. This assistance can be used to reclaim these lands for approved uses, which include pasture, range, woodland, cropland, noncommercial recreation, and wildlife habitat. The program's first priority is to protect public health, welfare, safety, and property from hazards caused by past surface coal mining or by surface effects of deep mining.</P>
              <P>(5) Watershed surveys and planning, authorized by the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Pub. L. 83-566, Section 6 (16 U.S.C. 1001-1008)). The 1996 appropriations act combined the Small Watershed Planning and the River Basin Surveys and Investigations programs into a new program called the Watershed Surveys and Planning Program. The program involves cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies to conduct watershed planning, river basin surveys and investigations, flood hazard analysis, and floodplain management assistance, which aid in the development of coordinated water resource programs, including the development of guiding principles and procedures.</P>
              <P>(6) Watershed and flood prevention operations include several activities. Watershed operations are authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944 (Public Law 78-534) and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (Public Law 87-566) and amendments; both of which are addressed by 7 CFR 622. Since 1998, the appropriations act for the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Public Law 83-566) has included funds, not to exceed a specified amount, that may be used for Public Law 78-534 projects.</P>
              <P>(i) Publc Law 83-566 and Public Law 78-534, jointly called the Small Watershed Program, authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate with State and local agencies to plan and carry out works of improvement for flood prevention; for the conservation, development, utilization, and disposal of water; and for the conservation and proper use of land in watershed or sub-watershed areas. Under Public Law 83-566, these areas shall not exceed 250,000 acres. There is no acreage limitation under Public Law 78-534.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Small Watershed Program provides for cooperation with State and other public agencies (called project sponsors) in the installation of planned works of improvement and land treatment measures in authorized watershed projects. Eligible measures include flood prevention, water conservation, recreation, agricultural water management, floodplain easements, municipal and industrial water, and rural water supply.</P>

              <P>(7) Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program, authorized by Section 216 of Public Law 81-516, 33 U.S.C. 701b-1, and Section 403 of the Agriculture Credit Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-334, 16 U.S.C. 2203), as amended by Section 382 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127, 110 Stat. 888, 1016). EWP provides assistance to reduce an imminent threat to life and property caused by a sudden impairment of a watershed from a natural disaster. Emergency work includes such measures as removing debris from streams, stabilizing streambanks, repairing levees, critical area stabilization, and purchasing floodplain easements. Technical and financial assistance is available to sponsoring local organizations (units of government, Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and organizations formed by State law) for this disaster <PRTPAGE P="471"/>recovery work. Sponsors are required to provide the local share of the costs; obtain real property rights, water rights, and permits; and do any needed operation and maintenance.</P>

                <P>(a) The equation for predicting soil loss due to wind in the Wind Erosion Equation (WEQ) is E = f(IKCLV). (For further information on WEQ see the paper by N.P. Woodruff and F.H. Siddaway, 1965. “A Wind Erosion Equation,” Soil Science Society of America Proceedings, Vol. 29, No. 5, pages 602-608, which is available from the American Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wisconsin. In addition, the use of the WEQ in NRCS is explained in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Agronomy Manual, 190-V-NAM, second ed., Part 502, March, 1988, which is available from the NRCS, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013.)</P>

                <P>(c) The factors in the WEQ equation are defined as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">E</E> is the estimation of the average annual soil loss in tons per acre.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">f</E> indicates the equation includes functional relationships that are not straight-line mathematical calculations.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">I</E> is the soil erodibility index. It is the potential for soil loss from a wide, level, unsheltered, isolated field with a bare, smooth, loose and uncrusted surface. Soil erodibility is based on soil surface texture, calcium carbonate content, and percent day.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">K</E> is the ridge roughness factor. It is a measure of the effect of ridges formed by tillage and planting implements on wind erosion. The ridge roughness is based on ridge spacing, height, and erosive wind directions in relation to the ridge direction</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">C</E> is the climatic factor. It is a measure of the erosive potential of the wind speed and surface moisture at a given location compared with the same factors at Garden City, Kansas. The annual climatic factor at Garden City is arbitrarily set at 100. All climatic factor values are expressed as a percentage of that at Garden City.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">L</E> is the unsheltered distance. It is the unsheltered distance across an erodible field, measured along the prevailing wind erosion direction. This distance is measured beginning at a stable border on the upwind side and continuing downward to the nonerodible or stable area, or to the downwind edge of the area being evaluated.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">V</E> is the vegetative cover factor. It accounts for the kind, amount, and orientation of growing plants or plant residue on the soil surface.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of USLE, RUSLE, and WEQ.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) All Highly Erodible Land (HEL) determinations are based on the formulas set forth in 7 CFR § 12.21 using some of the factors from the USLE and WEQ and the factor values that were contained in the local Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) as of January 1, 1990. In addition, this includes the soil loss tolerance values used in those formulas for determining HEL. The soil loss tolerance value is used as one of the criteria for planning soil conservation systems. These values are available in the FOTG in the local field office of the Natural Resources Conservation Service.</P>
                <P>(b) RUSLE will be used to:</P>
                <P>(1)(i) Evaluate the soil loss estimates of conservation systems contained in the FOTG.</P>

                <P>(ii) Evaluate the soil loss estimates of systems actually applied, where those systems were applied differently than specified in the conservation plan adopted by the producer or where a conservation plan was not developed, in determining whether a producer has complied with the HEL conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3801 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> set forth in 7 CFR part 12; and</P>

                <SUBJECT>Technical assistance furnished.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Provide technical assistance to grazing-land owners and managers to plan and implement resource conservation on grazing land. The objective of planning on grazing land is to assist landowners and managers in understanding the basic ecological principles associated with managing their land. This objective can be met by implementing a plan that meets the needs of the resources (soil, water, air, plants, and animals) and management objectives of the owner or manager. NRCS may provide assistance, at the request of the private grazing-land owner or manager to:</P>
                <P>(1) Maintain and improve private grazing land resources that provide multiple benefits;</P>
                <P>(2) Ensure the long-term sustainability of private grazing land resources;</P>

                <P>(3) Implement new grazing land management technologies;<PRTPAGE P="479"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) Manage resources on private grazing land through conservation planning, including, but not limited to; grazing management, nutrient management, and weed and invasive species control;</P>
                <P>(5) Maintain and improve water quality and quantity, aquatic and wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and aesthetics on private grazing land;</P>
                <P>(6) Harvest, process, and market private grazing land resources; and</P>
                <P>(7) Identify opportunities to diversify private grazing land enterprises.</P>
                <P>(b) Refer to 7 CFR 610.4 on other items relating to technical assistance.</P>
                <P>(c) To receive technical assistance, a landowner or manager may contact NRCS or the local conservation district to seek assistance to solve identified natural resource problems or opportunities. Participation in this program is voluntary.</P>

              <P>This part sets forth Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) policy and procedure for the administration of a cooperative snow survey and water supply forecast program. The program provides agricultural water users and other water management groups in the western states area with water supply forecasts to enable them to plan for efficient water management. The program also provides the public and the scientific community with a data base that can be used to accurately determine the extent of the now resource. The western states area comprises Alaska, Arizona, California (east side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range only), Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.</P>

              <P>To carry out the cooperative snow survey and water supply forecast program, NRCS:</P>
              <P>(a) Establishes, maintains, and operates manual and automated snow course and related hydro meteorological networks. Planning for such networks is carried out in accordance with OMB Circular A-62.</P>
              <P>(b) Determines and provides information on the expected water supply, including seasonal streamflow data. If pertinent and appropriate to the needs of cooperators and not otherwise available to them, may provide necessary interpretative analyses and forecasts required for operation of water-control structures and/or agricultural operations.</P>
              <P>(c) On request and to the extent NRCS resources and any required cooperator contributions are available, establishes hydrometeorological stations to cllect and provide data and necessary interpretive analyses to the requesting party. By written agreement NRCS may accept cooperators' funds, materials, equipment, and services for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(d) Develops and encourages use of new techniques and improving data collection and processing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy and objectives.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is NRCS policy to assemble, comparatively evaluate, release, and distribute for commercial increase new or improved plant materials and plant materials technology needed for broad programs of resource conservation and development for agriculture, wildlife, urban, recreation, and other land uses and environmental needs. It is the policy of NRCS to conduct plant materials work in cooperation with other agencies of the Department of Agriculture, such as the Agricultural Research Service, and with other Federal and State research agencies, including State agricultural experiment stations. The emphasis of the NRCS plant materials work is to find suitable plants to address conservation needs. In contrast, the emphasis of research agencies and organizations in plant development is to improve economically important crops. The NRCS program of testing and releasing new seed-propagated plant materials follows the guidelines in “Statement of Responsibilities and Policies Relating to the Development, Release, and Multiplication of Publicly Developed Varieties of Seed-Propagated Crops,” which was adopted in June 1972, by Land Grant Colleges and interested Federal agencies. NRCS releases improved conservation plant materials requiring vegetative multiplication in ways appropriate for particular States and particular species by working with experiment stations, crop improvement associations, and other State and Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(b) The objective of the plant materials activity is to select or develop special and improved plants and techniques for their successful establishment and maintenance to solve conservation problems and needs related to:</P>
              <P>(1) Controlling soil erosion on all lands;</P>
              <P>(2) Conserving water;</P>
              <P>(3) Protecting upstream watersheds;</P>
              <P>(4) Reducing sediment movement into waterways and reservoirs through the stabilization of critical sediment sources, such as surface mined lands, highway slopes, recreation sites, and urban and industrial development areas;</P>
              <P>(5) Stabilizing disposal areas for liquid and solid wastes;</P>
              <P>(6) Improving plant diversity and lengthening the grazing season on dryland pastures and rangelands;</P>

              <P>(7) Managing brush on mountain slopes with fire-retarding plant cover to reduce the possibility of fires that threaten life and property, or result in serious sediment sources;<PRTPAGE P="483"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) Improving the effectiveness of windbreaks and shelterbelts for reducing airborne sediment, controlling snow drifting, and preventing crop damage from wind erosion;</P>
              <P>(9) Protecting streambank, pond, and lake waterlines from erosion by scouring and wave action;</P>
              <P>(10) Improving wildlife food and cover, including threatened and endangered and pollinator species;</P>

              <SUBJECT>NRCS responsibilities in plant materials.</SUBJECT>
              <P>NRCS operates or enters into agreements with State universities or other State organizations to operate PMCs. NRCS also cooperates, both formally and informally, with other Federal, State, county, and nonprofit agencies or organizations on the selection of plants and evaluation of plant technology to increase the capabilities of PMCs. NRCS employs specialists for testing and selecting plant materials for conservation uses and the development of plant materials technology. NRCS' responsibilities are to:</P>
              <P>(a) Identify the resource conservation needs and cultural management methods for environmental protection and enhancement.</P>
              <P>(b) Assemble and comparatively evaluate plant materials at PMCs and on sites where soil, climate, or other conditions differ significantly from those at the Centers.</P>
              <P>(c) Make comparative field plantings for final testing of promising plants and techniques in cooperation with conservation districts and other interested cooperators.</P>
              <P>(d) Release cooperatively improved conservation plants and maintain the breeder or foundation stocks in ways appropriate for particular State and plant species by working with experiment stations, crop improvement associations, and other State and Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(e) Produce limited amounts of foundation or foundation-quality seed and plants available for allocation to conservation districts, experiment stations, other Federal and State research agencies, State seed certifying organizations and directly to commercial growers (if other options do not exist) that will use the material to establish seed fields, seed orchards, or vegetative plantings for large-scale increase.</P>
              <P>(f) Encourage and assist conservation districts, commercial seed producers, and commercial and State nurseries to produce needed plant materials for conservation uses.</P>
              <P>(g) Encourage the use of improved plant materials and plant materials technology in resource conservation and environmental improvement programs.</P>

              <P>This part sets forth the informal appeal procedures under which a participant may appeal adverse technical determinations or program decisions made by officials of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency under the Department of Agriculture (USDA). These regulations reflect NRCS policy to resolve at the agency level, to the greatest extent possible, disputes arising from adverse technical determinations and program decisions made by NRCS. Once a decision is rendered final by NRCS, participants may appeal to the National Appeals Division (NAD) as provided for under 7 CFR part 11, or to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) county committee pursuant to 7 CFR part 780 for decisions rendered under Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3801 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (Title XII).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preliminary technical determinations.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A preliminary technical determination is limited to those determinations made pursuant to the HELC/WC provisions (16 U.S.C. 3801, <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and becomes final 30 days after the participant receives the decision, unless the participant files an appeal with the appropriate NRCS official as indicated in the decision notice requesting:<PRTPAGE P="488"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Reconsideration with a field visit, office visit, or other designated location meeting site in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) Mediation as set forth in § 614.11.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If the participant requests reconsideration with a field visit, office visit, or other location visit, the designated conservationist, participant, and at the option of the conservation district, a district representative will make a field or office visit for the purpose of gathering additional information and discussing the facts relating to the preliminary technical determination. The participant may also provide any additional documentation to the designated conservationist.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 15 days of the field or office visit, the designated conservationist, based upon the agency record as supplemented by the field visit and any participant submissions, will reconsider his or her preliminary technical determination.</P>
              <P>(3) If the reconsidered determination is no longer adverse to the participant, the designated conservationist will issue the reconsidered determination as a final technical determination.</P>
              <P>(4) If the preliminary technical determination remains adverse, then the designated conservationist will forward the revised decision and agency record to the State Conservationist for a final determination pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, unless further appeal is waived in writing by the participant in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The State Conservationist will issue a final technical determination to the participant as soon as is practicable after receiving the reconsideration and agency record from the designated conservationist. The technical determination issued by the State Conservationist becomes a final NRCS technical determination upon receipt by the participant. Receipt triggers the running of the 30-day timeframe to appeal to NAD, or if applicable, to the FSA county committee.</P>
              <P>(d) In order to address application needs or resource issues on the ground immediately (expedited finality), a participant may waive, in writing to the State Conservationist, the reconsideration rights stated in paragraph (a) of this section so that a preliminary technical decision becomes final before the expiration of the 30-day appeal period.</P>

                <P>Cooperative river basin studies provide USDA planning assistance to Federal, State, and local governments. The purpose of these studies is to assist in appraising water and related land resources; defining and determining the extent of the problems; and formulating alternative plans, including land treatment, nonstructural or structural measures, or combinations thereof, that would solve existing problems or meet existing and projected needs. These studies concentrate on specific objectives identified by the requesting agencies and citizen groups that are consistent with USDA authorities and responsibilities and current NRCS priorities. The objectives ordinarily include the formulation of a plan but may require only inventories of available resources and associated problems to be used by other agencies in plan <PRTPAGE P="492"/>formulation. USDA assistance is provided through field advisory committees composed of representatives of the Economic Research Service, Forest Service, and NRCS. The NRCS representative chairs the field advisory committee.</P>

                <P>(a) To assist sponsors in preparing and carrying out watershed plans, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) shall conduct investigations and surveys, with the cooperation and assistance of other Federal agencies, to:</P>
                <P>(1) Determine the extent of watershed problems and needs, and</P>
                <P>(2) Set forth viable alternative solutions consistent with local, regional, and national objectives, including an alternative solution which makes the greatest net contribution to national economic development.</P>
                <P>(b) Alternatives will consist of either land treatment, nonstructural or structural measures, or combinations thereof that will help accomplish one or more of the authorized project purposes.</P>
                <P>(c) Authorized project purposes are watershed protection, conservation and proper utilization of land, flood prevention, agricultural water management including irrigation and drainage, public recreation, public fish and wildlife, municipal and industrial water supply, hydropower, water quality management, ground water supply, agricultural pollution control, and other water management.</P>
                <P>(d) After a final plan for works of improvement is agreed upon between NRCS and the sponsors and the approval processes are completed, NRCS will provide technical and financial assistance to install the project, subject to the availability of funds and the budgeting and fiscal policies of the President.</P>

Planning criteria, economic justification, local sponsorship, agency participation, financial assistance, eligible measures, operation and maintenance arrangements for the Pub. L. 78-534 program are consistent with those of the Pub. L. 83-566 program. The differences with the Pub. L. 78-534 program are outlined below.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Initiation.</E> Flood prevention projects are individually authorized by Federal legislation. The state conservationist and the sponsors agree on a plan of action and notify interested parties to solicit their participation. The sponsors keep the public informed and solicit their views and comments.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Subwatershed plans.</E> These plans are administratively approved by the state conservationist. If the plan involves purposes other than flood prevention, clearance must be obtained from the Office of Management and Budget before approval. Financial assistance available differs only in that program funds may be used for the purchase of land rights for single-purpose flood prevention structures and installing land treatment on Federal lands.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Installation.</E> NRCS shall award and administer contracts for the installation of project measures unless the sponsors agree to perform the work. Project agreements between the sponsors and NRCS are not required if the work consists of flood prevention structures built and funded by NRCS.</P>

                <P>(a) Watershed projects are to be planned and carried out in a way that will (1) minimize all adverse impacts, and (2) mitigate unavoidable losses to <PRTPAGE P="498"/>the maximum practicable degree. Projects must comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
                <P>(b) Fish and Wildlife enhancement measures proposed by Federal or State fish and wildlife agencies will be included if they are technically and economically feasible and are acceptable to the sponsors and the NRCS. If additional sponsors are needed to carry out the recommended fish and wildlife measures, NRCS will assist fish and wildlife agencies in attempting to obtain such sponsors.</P>
                <P>(c) All planning efforts by NRCS and the sponsors must include well publicized public meetings to obtain public input and views on the project.</P>
                <P>(d) Sponsors who receive financial assistance awarded after October 1, 2010, must comply with applicable registration and reporting requirements of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended), and 2 CFR parts 25 and 170.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The regulations in this part set forth the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program (EWRP). Under the EWRP, NRCS will make offers to purchase wetland conservation easements from persons owning croplands that were damaged by the 1993 Midwest floods if those lands have the potential for restoration to wetland conditions and if the owner voluntarily agrees to <PRTPAGE P="499"/>restore and maintain those conditions. The easements are to be purchased to promote the restoration and maintenance of wetland characteristics, such as hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil and hydrophytic vegetation. The functions and values of the wetlands for wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, flood water retention, floodway enhancement, ground water recharge, open space, aesthetic values, and environmental education will thus be promoted. The wetland conservation easements will permanently prohibit use of the affected land as cropland. Additionally, the easement shall require permanent maintenance of the wetland conditions, except in the case of natural disaster.</P>
              <P>(b) The EWRP is available only in the following States: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Certain cropland areas within these States have been determined to have been inundated by the Midwest floods of 1993. As more fully defined and described in this part, eligible land may include farmed wetlands or prior converted wetlands (wetlands converted prior to December 23, 1985), together with adjacent lands on which the wetlands are functionally dependent so long as the likelihood of successful restoration of such land and the potential wetland values merit inclusion in the program with reasonable costs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>EWP Program technical and financial assistance may be made available to a qualified sponsor, or landowners when a floodplain easement is the selected alternative by the Secretary of Agriculture, upon a qualified sponsor or landowner's request when a Federal emergency is declared by the President or when a local emergency is declared by the NRCS State Conservationist. The EWP Program is designed for emergency recovery work, including the purchase of floodplain easements. Emergency watershed protection is authorized in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.</P>

              <P>(iii) NRCS may authorize EWP assistance for modifying damaged practices when technology advances or construction techniques warrant modifications, including when modifications are the result of federal permitting or other requirements necessary to implement the recovery measure, and will be cost-shared as described in § 624.7.</P>
              <P>(iv) EWP assistance is only available when public or private landowners, land managers, land users, or others document they have exhausted or have insufficient funding or other resources available to provide adequate relief from applicable hazards.</P>
              <P>(4) Increased level of protection. In cases other than those described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, if the sponsor desires to increase the level of protection that would be provided by the EWP practice, the sponsor will be responsible for paying 100 percent of the costs of the upgrade or additional work.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible practices.</E> NRCS will only provide assistance for measures that:</P>
              <P>(1) Provide protection from additional flooding or soil erosion; and,</P>
              <P>(2) Reduce threats to life or property from a watershed impairment, including sediment and debris removal in floodplains and uplands; and</P>
              <P>(3) Restore the hydraulic capacity to the natural environment to the maximum extent practical; and</P>
              <P>(4) Are economically and environmentally defensible and technically sound.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> NRCS will document the economic rationale of proposed practices in appropriate detail before the allocation of emergency funding, including projects under consideration for floodplain easements in § 624.10. Generally, the expected value of the property restored should exceed the cost of emergency measures, including taking into consideration environmental benefits. Documentation will include, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Number of locations and extent of damage, including environmental and cultural resources at risk, because of the watershed impairment;</P>
              <P>(2) Estimated damages to the values at risk if the threat is imminent but not yet realized;</P>
              <P>(3) Events that must occur for any imminent threat to be realized and the estimated probability of their occurrence both individually and collectively;</P>
              <P>(4) Estimates of the nature, extent, and costs of the emergency practices to be constructed to recover from an actual threat or relieve an imminent threat;</P>
              <P>(5) Thorough description of the beneficial and adverse effects on environmental resources, including fish and wildlife habitat;</P>
              <P>(6) Description of water quality and water conservation impacts, as appropriate;</P>

              <P>(7) Analysis of effects on downstream water rights; and<PRTPAGE P="510"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) Other information deemed appropriate by NRCS to describe adequately the environmental impacts to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and related requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Implementation.</E> When planning emergency recovery practices, NRCS will emphasize measures that are the most economical and are to be accomplished by using the least damaging practical construction techniques and equipment that retain as much of the existing characteristics of the landscape and habitat as possible. Construction of emergency practices may include, but are not limited to, timing of the construction to avoid impacting fish spawning, clearing of right-of-ways, reshaping spoil, debris removal, use of bioengineering techniques, and revegetation of disturbed areas. Mitigation actions needed to offset potential adverse impacts of the EWP Program practices should be planned for installation before, or concurrent with, the installation of the EWP Program practices. In rare occurrences where mitigation cannot be installed concurrently, plans will require mitigation be accomplished as soon as practical.</P>
              <P>(f) NRCS may determine that a measure is not eligible for assistance for any reason, including economic and environmental factors or technical feasibility.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under HFRP:</P>
              <P>(1) NRCS will purchase conservation easements from, or enter into 30-year contracts or 10-year cost-share agreements with, eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate in the restoration and protection of forestlands and associated lands.</P>
              <P>(2) A landowner will participate in HFRP by agreeing to the implementation of an HFRP restoration plan, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, and manage the habitat conditions necessary to increase the likelihood of recovery of listed species under the ESA, or measurably improve the well-being of species that are candidates for such listing, that is a candidate for listing under section 4 of ESA, State-listed species or species deemed of greatest conservation need by a State wildlife action plan, or species identified by the Chief for special consideration for funding.</P>
              <P>(3) NRCS may provide cost-share assistance for the activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of forest ecosystem functions and values. Specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management activities may be undertaken by the landowner or other NRCS designee.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Landowner eligibility.</E> To be eligible to enroll an easement in the HFRP, an individual or entity must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is sought; and</P>
              <P>(2) Agree to provide such information to NRCS, as the agency deems necessary or desirable, to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible land.</E> (1) NRCS, in coordination with FWS or NMFS, will determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration, enhancement, and protection of forest ecosystem functions and values when considering the cost of acquiring the easement, 30-year contract, or 10-year cost share agreement, and the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management costs.</P>
              <P>(2) Land will be considered eligible for enrollment in HFRP only if NRCS determines that such private forest land or private land being restored to forest land will contribute to the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of the habitat or measurably:</P>
              <P>(i) Increase the likelihood of recovery for a selected species listed under section 4 of ESA; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Improve the well-being of a selected species that is a candidate for listing under section 4 of ESA, or the selected species is a State-listed species, or deemed a species of greatest conservation need by a State wildlife action plan, or is a species identified by the Chief for special consideration for funding.<PRTPAGE P="517"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) NRCS may also enroll land adjacent to eligible land if the enrollment of such adjacent land would contribute significantly to the practical administration of the easement area, but not more than it determines is necessary for such contribution.</P>
              <P>(4) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of the area for easement purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program objectives.</P>
              <P>(5) In the case of acreage owned by an Indian tribe, NRCS may enroll acreage into the HFRP which is privately owned by either the tribe or an individual.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Ineligible land.</E> The following land is not eligible for enrollment in the HFRP:</P>
              <P>(1) Land owned by the United States, States, or units of local government;</P>
              <P>(2) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction that already provides for the protection of fish and wildlife habitat or that would interfere with HFRP purposes, as determined by NRCS;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Sign-up process.</E> As funds are available, the Chief will solicit project proposals from the State Conservationist. The State Conservationist may consult with other agencies at the State, Federal, and local levels to develop proposals. The State Conservationist will submit the proposal(s) to the Chief for funding selection. Upon selection for funding, the State Conservationist will issue a public sign-up notice which will announce and explain the rationale for decisions based on the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The geographic scope of the sign-up;</P>
              <P>(2) Any additional program eligibility criteria that are not specifically listed in this part;</P>
              <P>(3) Any additional requirements that participants must include in their HFRP applications that are not specifically identified in this part;</P>
              <P>(4) Information on the priority order of enrollment for funding;</P>
              <P>(5) An estimate of the total funds NRCS expects to obligate during a given sign-up; and</P>
              <P>(6) The schedule for the sign-up process, including the deadline(s) for applying.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for participation.</E> To apply for enrollment through an easement, 30-year contract, or 10-year cost-share agreement, a landowner must submit an application for participation in the HFRP during an announced period for such sign-up.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Preliminary agency actions.</E> By filing an application for participation, the applicant consents to an NRCS representative entering upon the land for purposes of determining land eligibility, and for other activities that are necessary or desirable for NRCS to make offers of enrollment. The applicant is entitled to accompany an NRCS representative on any site visits.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Voluntary reduction in compensation.</E> In order to enhance the probability of enrollment in HFRP, an applicant may voluntarily offer to accept a lesser payment than is being offered by NRCS. Such offer and subsequent payments may not be less than those rates set forth in § 625.8 and § 625.10 of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishing priority for enrollment in HFRP.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Ranking considerations.</E> Based on the specific criteria set forth in a sign-up announcement and the applications for participation, NRCS, in coordination FWS and NMFS, may consider the following factors to rank properties:</P>
              <P>(1) Estimated conservation benefit to habitat required by threatened or endangered species listed under section 4 of the ESA;</P>

              <P>(2) Estimated conservation benefit to habitat required by species not listed <PRTPAGE P="518"/>as endangered or threatened under section 4 of the ESA but that are candidates for such listing, State-listed species, or deemed of greatest conservation need under a State wildlife action plan, or species identified by the Chief for special consideration for funding;</P>
              <P>(3) Estimated improvement of biological diversity, if enrolled;</P>
              <P>(4) Potential for increased capability of carbon sequestration, if enrolled;</P>
              <P>(5) Availability of contribution of non-Federal funds;</P>
              <P>(6) Significance of forest ecosystem functions and values;</P>
              <P>(7) Estimated cost-effectiveness of the particular restoration cost-share agreement, contract, or easement, and associated HFRP restoration plan; and</P>
              <P>(8) Other factors identified in a HFRP sign-up notice.</P>
              <P>(b) NRCS may place higher priority on certain forest ecosystems based regions of the State or multi-State area where restoration of forestland may better achieve NRCS programmatic and sign-up goals and objectives.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, NRCS may enroll eligible lands at any time in order to encompass project areas subject to multiple land ownership or otherwise to achieve program objectives. Similarly, NRCS may, at any time, exclude otherwise eligible lands if the participation of the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of the forest ecosystem and those adjacent landowners are unwilling to participate.</P>
              <P>(d) If available funds are insufficient to accept the highest ranked application, and the applicant is not interested in reducing the acres offered to match available funding, NRCS may select a lower ranked application that can be fully funded. In cases where HFRP funds are not sufficient to cover the costs of an application selected for funding, the applicant may lower the cost of the application by changing the duration of the easement or agreement or reducing the acreage offered, unless these changes result in a reduction of the application ranking score below that of the score of the next available application on the ranking list.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Offers of enrollment.</E> Based on the priority ranking, NRCS will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance into the program. This notice of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind NRCS or the United States to enroll the proposed project in HFRP, nor does it bind the landowner to convey an easement, or to contract or agree to HFRP activities. The letter notifies the landowner that NRCS intends to continue the enrollment process on their land unless otherwise notified by the landowner.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptance of offer of enrollment.</E> An agreement to purchase or a restoration cost-share agreement or contract will be presented by NRCS to the landowner which will describe the easement, agreement, or contract area; the easement, agreement, or contract terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of the acceptance of the offer.</E> After the agreement to purchase or restoration cost-share agreement or contract is executed by NRCS and the landowner, the land will be considered enrolled in the HFRP. For easements, NRCS will proceed with various easement acquisition activities, which may include conducting a survey of the easement area, securing necessary subordination agreements, procuring title insurance, and conducting other activities necessary to record the easement or implement the HFRP, as appropriate for the enrollment option being considered. For restoration cost-share agreements and contracts, the landowner will proceed to implement the restoration plan with technical assistance and cost-share from NRCS.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Withdrawal of offers.</E> Prior to execution of an agreement to purchase, a restoration cost-share agreement, or contract between the United States and the landowner, NRCS may withdraw the land from enrollment at any time due to lack of availability of funds, inability to clear title, or other reasons. An agreement to purchase will be void, and the offer withdrawn, if not executed by the landowner within the time specified.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination of easement payment rates.</E> (1) NRCS will offer to pay not less than 75 percent, nor more than 100 percent of the fair market value of the enrolled land during the period the land is subject to the easement, less the fair market value of the land encumbered by the easement for permanent easements or easements for the maximum duration allowed under State law.</P>
              <P>(2) NRCS will offer to pay not more than 75 percent of the fair market value of the enrolled land, less the fair market value of the land encumbered by the easement for 30-year easements or 30-year contracts.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptance and use of contributions.</E> NRCS may accept and use contributions of non-Federal funds to make payments under this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Acceptance of offered easement or 30-year contract compensation.</E> (1) NRCS will not acquire any easement or 30-year contract unless the landowner accepts the amount of the payment that is offered by NRCS. The payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement or 30-year contract. By voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim to additional compensation based on fair market value.</P>
              <P>(2) Payments may be made in a single payment or through annual payment, as agreed to between NRCS and the landowner.</P>
              <P>(d) If a landowner believes they may be eligible for a bargain sale tax deduction that is the difference between the fair market value of the easement conveyed to the United States and the easement payment made to the landowner, it is the landowner's responsibility to discuss those matters with the Internal Revenue Service. NRCS disclaims any representations concerning the tax implications of any easement or cost-share transaction.</P>

              <P>(1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement or an easement for the maximum duration allowed under State law, NRCS will offer to pay not less than 75 percent nor more than 100 percent of the actual or<E T="03"/> average cost, and;</P>
              <P>(2) On enrolled land subject to a 30-year easement or 30-year contract, NRCS will offer to pay not more than 75 percent of the actual or average cost.</P>

              <P>(b) Landowner Protections may be made available to landowners enrolled in the HFRP who agree, for a specified period, to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, and manage the habitat conditions on their land in a manner that is reasonably expected to result in a net conservation benefit that contributes to the recovery of listed species under the ESA, candidate, or other species covered by this regulation. These protections operate with lands enrolled in the HFRP and are valid for as long as the landowner is in compliance with the terms and conditions of such assurances, any associated permit, the easement, contract, or the restoration agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Landowner Protections, or any associated permit, require the adoption of a conservation practice or measure in addition to the conservation practices and measures identified in the applicable HFRP restoration plan, NRCS and the landowner will incorporate the conservation practice or measure into the HFRP restoration plan as an item eligible for cost-share assistance.</P>
              <P>(d) Failure to perform planned management activities can result in violation of the easement, 30-year contract, 10-year cost-share agreement, or the agreement under which Landowner Protections have been provided. NRCS will work with landowners to plan appropriate management activities.</P>
              <P>(e) The amount and terms and conditions of the cost-share assistance will be subject to the following restrictions on the costs of establishing or installing NRCS approved conservation practices or implementing measures specified in the HFRP restoration plan:</P>
              <P>(1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement or an easement for the maximum duration allowed under State law, NRCS will offer to pay not less than 75 percent nor more than 100 percent of the average cost, and;</P>
              <P>(2) On enrolled land subject to a 30-year easement or 30-year contract, NRCS will offer to pay not more than 75 percent of the average cost.</P>

              <P>(g) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by NRCS that an eligible conservation practice or measure has been established in compliance with appropriate standards and specifications. Identified conservation practices and measures may be implemented by the landowner or other designee.</P>

              <P>(h) Cost-share payments may be made for the establishment and installation of additional eligible conservation practices and measures, or the maintenance or replacement of an eligible conservation practice or measure, but only if NRCS determines the practice or measure is needed to meet the objectives of HFRP, and the failure of the original conservation practices or <PRTPAGE P="521"/>measures was due to reasons beyond the control of the landowner.</P>

              <P>(b) The HFRP restoration plan will specify the manner in which the enrolled land under easement, 30-year contract, or 10-year cost-share agreement will be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to accomplish the goals of the program.</P>
              <P>(c) Eligible restoration practices and measures may include land management, vegetative, and structural practices and measures that will restore and enhance habitat conditions for listed species, candidate, State-listed, and other species identified by the Chief for special funding consideration. To the extent practicable, eligible practices and measures will improve biodiversity and optimize the sequestration of carbon through management that maintains diverse and high quality native forests to accomplish the goals of the restoration plan. NRCS, in coordination with FWS and NMFS, will determine the conservation practices and measures.

              <P>(iii) The program participant will be covered by the authorization to NRCS for incidental take associated with restoration actions or management activities. The incidental take may include a return to baseline conditions at the end of the applicable period, if the landowner so desires.<PRTPAGE P="523"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Provided the landowner has acted in good faith and without intent to violate the terms of the HFRP restoration plan, NRCS will pursue all appropriate options with the participant to avoid termination in the event of the need to terminate an HFRP restoration plan that is being properly implemented; and</P>
              <P>(v) If the 30-year contract or 10-year restoration cost-share agreement is terminated, any requested assurances, including an incidental take authorization under this section, provided by NRCS will be voided. As such, the landowner will be responsible to FWS or NMFS for any violations of the ESA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">SHA or CCAA.</E>(i) NRCS will provide technical assistance to help participants design and use their HFRP restoration plan for the dual purposes of qualifying for HFRP financial assistance and as a basis for entering into a SHA or CCAA with FWS or NMFS and receiving an associated permit under section 10(a)(1)(a) of the ESA.</P>
              <P>(ii) In exchange for a commitment to undertake conservation measures, the landowner may receive a permit under section 10 of the ESA from FWS or NMFS authorizing incidental take of species covered by the SHA or CCAA that may occur as a result of restoration actions, management activities, and for a listed species covered by a SHA, a return to baseline conditions at the end of the applicable period.</P>
              <P>(iii) All SHAs and associated permits issued by FWS or NMFS are subject to the Safe Harbor Policy jointly adopted by FWS and NMFS according to the regulations at 64 FR 32717 or applicable subsequently adopted policy, and SHAs with FWS also are subject to regulations at 50 CFR 17.22(c) for endangered species or 50 CFR 17.32(c) for threatened species, or applicable subsequent regulations.</P>
              <P>(iv) All CCAAs and associated permits issued by FWS or NMFS are subject to the CCAAs policy jointly adopted by FWS and NMFS according to the regulations at 64 FR 32706 or applicable subsequently adopted policy, and CCAAs with FWS also are subject to regulations at 50 CFR 17.22(d) for endangered species or 50 CFR 17.32(d) for threatened species, or applicable subsequent regulations.</P>
              <P>(v) If the 30-year contract or 10-year restoration cost-share agreement is terminated, the landowner will be responsible to notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS or any other relevant party to the specific SHA or CCAA, as appropriate, for any modifications related to the SHA or CCAA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Modification of the HFRP restoration plan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The State Conservationist may approve modifications to the HFRP restoration plan that do not modify or void provisions of the easement, contract, restoration agreement, or Landowner Protections, and are consistent with applicable law. NRCS may obtain and receive input from the landowner and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to determine whether a modification to the restoration plan is justified. Any HFRP restoration plan modification must meet HFRP program objectives, and must result in equal or greater wildlife benefits and ecological and economic values to the United States. Modifications to the HFRP restoration plan which are substantial and affect provisions of the contract, restoration cost-share agreement, or Landowner Protections will require agreement from the landowner, any relevant party to a specific SHA or CCAA, FWS, or NMFS, as appropriate, and may require execution of an amended contract or 10-year restoration cost-share agreement and modification to the Landowner Protection provisions.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Offers voided prior to enrollment.</E> Any transfer of the property prior to the applicant's acceptance into the program will void the offer of enrollment. At the option of the State Conservationist, an offer can be extended to the new landowner if the new landowner agrees to the same or more restrictive easement, agreement, and contract terms and conditions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Actions following transfer of land.</E> (1) For easements or 30-year contracts with multiple annual payments, any remaining payments will be made to the original landowner unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.</P>

              <P>(2) Eligible cost-share payments will be made to the new landowner upon <PRTPAGE P="524"/>presentation of an assignment of rights or other evidence that title has passed.</P>
              <P>(3) Landowner protections will be available to the new landowner, and the new landowner will be held responsible for assuring completion of all measures and conservation practices required by the contract, deed, and incidental take permit.</P>
              <P>(4) If a SHA or CCAA is involved, the previous and new landowner may coordinate with FWS or NMFS, as appropriate, to transfer the agreement and associated permits and assurances.</P>
              <P>(5) The landowner and NRCS may agree to transfer a 30-year contract. The transferee must be determined by NRCS to be eligible to participate in HFRP and must assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation and maintenance of all conservation practices and measures required by the contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims to payments.</E> With respect to any and all payments owed to a person, the United States will bear no responsibility for any full payments or partial distributions of funds between the original landowner and the landowner's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, NRCS may withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement or adjudication on the rights to the funds.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Easement Violations.</E> (1) In the event of a violation of the easement or any associated agreement involving a landowner, the landowner will be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as the State Conservationist determines is necessary to correct the violation.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, NRCS reserves the right to enter upon the easement area at any time to remedy deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when such actions are deemed necessary to protect important listed species, candidate species, and forest ecosystem functions and values or other rights of the United States under the easement. The landowner will be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a result of the landowner's negligence or failure to comply with easement or contractual obligations.</P>
              <P>(3) In addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies as may be available to the United States under applicable law, NRCS may withhold any easement and cost-share payments owed to landowners at any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants, associated restoration agreement, or any associated contract. Such withheld funds may be used to offset costs incurred by the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages pursuant to court order or settlement agreement.</P>
              <P>(4) The United States will be entitled to recover any and all administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, associated with any enforcement or remedial action.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">30-year Contract and 10-year Cost-Share Agreement Violations.</E> (1) If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the terms of a 30-year contract, or 10-year cost-share agreement, or documents incorporated by reference into the 30-year contract or 10-year cost-share agreement, the landowner will be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as the State Conservationist determines is necessary to correct the violation. If the violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the 30-year contract or 10-year cost-share agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 10-year cost-share agreement or 30-year contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has: submitted false information; filed a false claim; engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part; or taken actions NRCS deems to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.</P>

              <P>(3) If NRCS terminates a 10-year cost-share agreement or 30-year contract, the participant will forfeit all rights for future payments under the 10-year <PRTPAGE P="525"/>cost-share agreement or 30-year contract, and must refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest, and liquidated damages.</P>
              <P>(4) When making any 30-year contract or 10-year cost-share agreement termination decisions, the State Conservationist may provide equitable relief in accordance with 7 CFR part 635.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Great Plains Conservation Program (GPCP) is a special program targeted to the total conservation treatment of farm or ranch units with the most severe soil and water resources problems. The purpose of the program is to assist farm, ranch and other land users to make changes in their cropping systems and land uses which are needed to conserve, develop, protect, and utilize the soil and water resources of their lands. This purpose is achieved by controlling erosion, conserving water, and adjusting land use to mitigate climatic, soil, topographic, flood, saline and other natural hazards.</P>
                <P>(b) Program participation is voluntary and is carried out by applying a conservation plan encompassing an entire operating unit. A conservation plan is developed with the land user in consultation with the local conservation district and is used to establish a GPCP contract. This contract provides for cost sharing between the land user and the Secretary of Agriculture for applying needed land use adjustments and conservation treatment within a specified time schedule. The program is supplemental to, not a substitution for, other programs in the Great Plains area.</P>

                <P>(d) NRCS is to coordinate Rural Abandoned Mine Program activities with NRCS programs and the other reclamation programs authorized by Pub. L. 95-87 that are carried out by the Office of Surface Mining of the U.S. Department of the Interior, State reclamation agencies, and Indian tribes. Coordination includes program development, development of reclamation standards, preparation of special reports, requests for funding, and related actions required to achieve coordination between programs.</P>
                <P>(e) NRCS is to consult with State and local reclamation committees to obtain recommendations on program operation, evaluation of applications for reclamation assistance, and public participation. The NRCS State Conservationist is to use existing reclamation committees or encourage the organization of a new State committee for this purpose. The State Conservationist is to serve as a member when the committee is functioning for the purposes of this program. Representatives of the Office of Surface Mining, State reclamation agency, State water quality agency, State conservation agency, and other agencies or groups are to be invited to participate as members. Individual citizens may participate through the State committee. Local committees, if needed, are to be organized on a multicounty, county, conservation district, or other appropriate area with a local membership structure similar to the State committee. The district conservationist is to be a member of a local reclamation committee organized to provide program guidance.</P>

                <P>(a) All eligible applications within a State are to be assigned a funding priority and subpriority. Assignment of a priority and subpriority establishes the order in which the proposed reclamation work will be selected and evaluated for funding. (See § 632.20(b) for additional selection criteria.) Applications for individual, joint, or special projects (See § 632.18) for areas of different priorities or subpriorities are to be assigned the highest applicable priority or subpriority. The funding priorities are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Priority 1.</E> Protection of public health, safety, general welfare, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal-mining practices. Extreme danger means a condition that could be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons, property, or the environment and to which persons or improvements on real property are exposed.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Priority 2.</E> Protection of public health, safety, and general welfare from the adverse effects of coal-mining practices that do not constitute an extreme danger.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Priority 3.</E> Restoration of the land and water resources and the environment where previously degraded by the adverse effects of coal-mining practices, including measures for the conservation and development of soil, water (excluding channelization), woodland, fish and wildlife, recreation resources, and agricultural productivity. First consideration in this priority is to be the reduction of offsite damage affecting the public. Second consideration is to be given to restoring to beneficial uses for the main benefit of the land user.</P>
                <P>(b) Eligible and feasible applications for program assistance within each priority category (§ 632.12(a)) are to be funded in the following order:</P>

                <P>(1) Individual persons or public entities who owned the eligible area before May 2, 1977, and who neither consented to nor exercised control over the mining operation.<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Individual persons who would actively use the area, if reclaimed, for agricultural or silvicultural purposes.</P>
                <P>(3) All other participants.</P>

                <P>Lands and water eligible for reclamation are those that were mined for coal or were affected by coal-mining processes and were abandoned or inadequately reclaimed before August 3, 1977. These lands and water are not eligible if:</P>
                <P>(a) There is continuing reclamation responsibility on the part of a mine operator, permittee, or agent under State or Federal law or on the part of the State as a result of bond forfeiture. However, if the amount of the bond forfeiture was insufficient to reclaim the area covered by the bond, the area will be considered eligible.</P>
                <P>(b) They are under Federal ownership and control.</P>
                <P>(c) The surface rights are under easement or lease to be remined for coal or other minerals.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Eligible uses and treatment of reclaimed lands.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Reclaimed lands and water may be used for cropland, hayland, pasture land, rangeland, woodland, wildlife land, natural areas, noncommercial recreation land, and the supporting uses associated with these land uses. Other land uses proposed by public entities for public use and benefit such as open space, conservation uses, natural areas, and recreation sites may be approved by the NRCS State conservationist in accordance with the priorities stated in § 632.12. However, development of public sites, such as the installation of recreation facilities, is not eligible for cost sharing.</P>
                <P>(b) Reclaimed land use is determined by the objectives of the land user, compatibility of the land use with surrounding land use, and the practicability and feasibility of restoring the soil and water resources to support the use selected.</P>
                <P>(c) The maximum acreage of eligible lands and water that may be offered for contract under one ownership is 320 acres for the life of the program.</P>
                <P>(d) Conservation treatment eligible for Federal cost sharing includes the combination of practices needed and feasible to achieve:</P>
                <P>(1) Protection of life, property, and elimination of public health and safety hazards, including land stabilization.</P>
                <P>(2) Restoration of the environment where degraded by past mining, including water quality, visual quality, recreation resources, fish and wildlife habitat, and erosion and sediment control.</P>
                <P>(3) A site that can be developed for a beneficial use as specified in § 632.15(a). Examples of eligible treatment that may be cost shared include but are not limited to: Land shaping and grading, critical area planting or other plantings for stabilization, improving visual quality, wildlife food and cover, diversions or terraces, waterways or lined ditches, grade stabilization structures, sediment basins, and special practices for sealing shafts and tunnels, correcting subsidence problems, or other unusual situations. Practices not eligible for cost sharing are those that are solely applied to develop a reclamation site (including sites developed by public entities for public use), increase the production of crops, or for the recurring maintenance of applied reclamation.</P>

                <P>(e) Applied conservation treatment is to meet the applicable Federal and State standards for the reclamation <PRTPAGE P="535"/>and conservation treatment of abandoned or inadequately reclaimed coal-mined lands and water. Where needed, these standards are incorporated in local NRCS technical guides as the NRCS standards and specifications applicable to the program. Special practices as specified in § 632.15(d) are to be developed in cooperation with appropriate State or Federal agencies having the expertise or responsibility for the practices.</P>
                <P>(f) NRCS State conservationists, in consultation with the State reclamation committee, are to:</P>
                <P>(1) Develop a list of practices that are eligible for cost sharing, and</P>
                <P>(2) Maintain, as applicable, lists of average costs of applying conservation treatment to eligible lands and waters.</P>

                <P>(a) Land users may arrange to apply the planned land uses and conservation treatment specified in the contract by one or more of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(1) By performing the required treatment with his own labor and equipment.</P>
                <P>(2) By hiring a qualified contractor to install the required treatment.</P>
                <P>(3) By requesting NRCS to award and administer a contract to perform the required treatment in accordance with 41 CFR chapters I and IV.</P>
                <P>(b) State conservationists are to develop criteria specifying the conditions for which NRCS will award and administer a contract. Criteria will consider: Type of equipment required, type and amount of conservation treatment required, costs of the required reclamation, needs of the land user, and the applicable cost-share rate. If the Federal share is less than 100 percent, a land user must put up his estimated share of the cost before NRCS awards the contract.</P>

                <P>(a) Cost-share rates paid by the Federal Government are to be established and issued as instructions by the NRCS Administrator in accordance with the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) For 120 acres or less, the cost-share rate is to provide up to 80 percent of the costs of land use and conservation treatment depending on the income-producing potential of the land after reclamation. However, this rate may be increased to a level required to obtain participation if the main benefits of reclamation are offsite (in the public interest) and there is a declaration of financial burden by the participant.</P>
                <P>(2) The rate on acreage in excess of 120 acres up to 320 acres maximum is to be reduced by up to 0.5 percent per acre. This reduced rate applies to the entire acreage offered for contract.</P>

Exceptions to the 3-year provision may be granted by the state conservationist for unusual circumstances.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfer of contract.</E> (1) If during the contract period all or part of the right and interest in the land is transferred by sale or other action, the contract is terminated on the land unit that was transferred and the land user:</P>
                <P>(i) Forfeits all right to any future cost-share payments on the transferred land unit, and</P>
                <P>(ii) Must refund cost-share payments that have been made on the transferred land unit not to exceed the difference between the estimated value of the land at the time of entering into the contract and at the time of transfer, unless the new land user becomes a party to the contract as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) If the new land user becomes a party to the contract:</P>
                <P>(i) He is to assume all obligations of the previous land user on the transferred land unit.</P>
                <P>(ii) The contract with the new land user is to remain in effect with the original terms and conditions.</P>
                <P>(iii) The contract is to be modified in writing to show the changes caused by the transfer. If the modification is not acceptable to the contracting officer, the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section apply.</P>
                <P>(3) The transfer of all or part of a land unit by a land user does not affect the rights and obligations of other land users who have signed the contract.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Modification of contract.</E> (1) A contract previously entered into with a land user may be modified only with the approval of the State conservationist or as authorized under established policies. No contract may be modified unless it is determined that the modification is desirable to carry out the program.</P>
                <P>(2) Contracts may be modified to add, delete, substitute, or reapply conservation treatment if:</P>
                <P>(i) Applied conservation treatment failed to achieve the desired results through no fault of the land user,</P>
                <P>(ii) Applied treatment deteriorated because of conditions beyond the control of the land user, or</P>
                <P>(iii) Other treatment is substituted that will achieve the desired results.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Joint contract.</E> A land user may enter a contract jointly with other land users subject to the 320 acres maximum limitation per landowner. However, joint participation is permitted only if it will result in better land use and treatment than individual participation or if it is required by §§ 632.14 and 632.18(a)(2).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Termination of contract.</E> Contracts may be terminated by mutual consent of the signatories only if the State conservationist determines that the termination is authorized under established policies and is in the public interest. In this case, the State conservationist is to determine the amount of refund.</P>

                <P>This subpart contains procedures for making cost-share payments to a land user when land use and conservation treatment is applied as specified in § 632.16(a)(1) or (2).</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 632.31</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Cost-share payment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount of cost-share payment.</E> Cost-share payments are to be made at rates specified in the contract. The cost-share payment is to be determined by one of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(1) Average cost.</P>
                <P>(2) Actual cost but not more than the average cost.</P>

                <P>(3) Specified maximum cost. If the average cost or the specified maximum cost at the time of starting the installation of a conservation practice or <PRTPAGE P="538"/>identifiable unit is less than the cost specified in the contract, payment is to be made at the lower rate. If the cost at the start of installation is higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A contract modification is necessary if NRCS determines that the higher cost is a significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. If costs are significant, cost-share payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase is approved. If the higher costs are not significant, cost-share payments may be made if funds are available.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Time of payment.</E> Cost-share payments are to be made to the land user after a practice or an identifiable unit has been satisfactorily applied. The land user is to submit claims for payment to the district conservationist no later than September 30 of the year after application. Late claims require approval of the State conservationist before payment can be made. A claim is to show the proportion of each land user's contribution to the applied practice or identifiable unit.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval.</E> The district conservationist must certify that a practice or identifiable unit has been satisfactorily applied before NRCS can make cost-share payments.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Ineligible claim.</E> A land user is not eligible to receive cost-share payments for a practice or an identifiable unit that was not carried out under program requirements.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Authorization for payment.</E> (1) Materials or services needed to carry out contracts are to be obtained by land users. Contracts may provide for part or all of the cost-share payment for a practice or identifiable unit to be made directly to suppliers of materials or services. The materials or services must be delivered or performed before payment is made.</P>
                <P>(2) The contracting officer is to authorize payment for materials or services not exceeding:</P>
                <P>(i) The cost share of the material or service used, or</P>
                <P>(ii) The total cost share of the practices or identifiable unit if requested by the land user.</P>
                <P>(3) The land user who purchases materials or services to carry out a contract is responsible for them until the district conservationist determines that the material or service was used for the intended purpose. If a material or service cost-shared by NRCS is used for a purpose other than to carry out the contract, the land user is indebted to the United States for the cost of the misused material or service. This indebtedness is to be repaid to NRCS as a refund or withheld from cost-share payments otherwise due the land user under the contract.</P>
                <P>(4) NRCS has the right to inspect materials or services and to take samples for testing. Inspections by NRCS will not be necessary if NRCS considers State inspection regulations adequate.</P>
                <P>(5) Materials or services must meet the quality standards as specified. NRCS may make exceptions for materials or services that do not meet the standards only if they will satisfactorily serve the intended purpose. NRCS is to deduct from the cost-share payment the difference between the price of the materials or services specified and the actual value of the different materials or services.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Division of cost-share payments.</E> Federal cost-share payments made directly to suppliers of materials or services are credited to the land user who was issued the authorization. The remainder of the cost share is credited to the land user who carried out the remainder of the practice or identifiable unit. If more than one land user contributed to carrying out a practice or identifiable unit, the cost-share payment is to be divided proportionately according to the contribution made by each of the land users. Furnishing a landright or water right is not a contribution for cost-share payment purposes.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Other aid.</E> Non-Federal public entities may furnish all or part of the land user's portion of the cost of applying a practice or identifiable unit with no reduction in the Federal cost share.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Assignments and claims.</E> Land users may not assign cost-share payments except as provided under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 203, as amended by 41 U.S.C. 15. Federal cost-share payments due any land user are not subject to claims for advances except as provided in this section.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Actions causing violation.</E> The following actions constitute violation of a contract by a land user:</P>
                <P>(1) Knowingly or negligently damaging or causing conservation treatment to be impaired.</P>
                <P>(2) Adopting land use or treatment that tends to defeat the program purposes during the period of the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) Failing to comply with the terms of the contract.</P>
                <P>(4) Filing a false claim.</P>
                <P>(5) Misusing an authorization.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of violation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Contract to be terminated.</E> (i) By signing a contract, the land user agrees to forfeit all rights to further cost-share payments under a contract and to refund cost-share payments received not to exceed the difference between the estimated value of the land at time of entering into the contract and the value at time of termination, if the contracting officer, with approval of the State conservationist, determines that:</P>
                <P>(A) There was a violation of the contract during the time the land user had control of the land, and</P>
                <P>(B) The violation was of a nature as to warrant termination of the contract.</P>
                <P>(ii) The land user is to be obligated to refund cost-share payments and cost shares paid under authorizations not to exceed the difference between the estimated value of the land at time of entering into the contract and the value at time of termination.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Contract not terminated.</E> (i) By signing a contract, the land user agrees to refund cost-share payments received under the contract or to accept payment adjustment if the contracting officer, with the approval of the State conservationist, determines that:</P>
                <P>(A) There was a violation of the contract during the time the land user had control of the land, and</P>
                <P>(B) The nature of the violation does not warrant termination of the contract.</P>
                <P>(ii) Payment adjustments may include decreasing the rate of a cost share, deleting a cost-share commitment from the contract, or withholding cost-share payments earned but not paid. The land user who signs the contract may be obligated to refund cost-share payments and cost shares paid under authorizations.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Violation procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section prescribes the regulations dealing with contract violations. The Chief reserves the right to revise or supplement any of the provisions of this section at any time if the action does not adversely affect the land user, or if the land user has been officially notified before this action is taken. No cost-share payment shall be made pending the decision on whether a contract violation has occurred.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination by contracting officer.</E> On notification that a contract violation may have occurred, the contracting officer is to:</P>
                <P>(1) Determine, with the approval of the State conservationist, that a violation did not occur or that the violation was of such a nature that no penalty of forfeiture, refund, or payment adjustment is necessary. No notice is issued to the land user, and no further action is to be taken; or</P>
                <P>(2) Determine that a violation did occur, but the land user agrees to accept the penalty. If the land user agrees in writing to accept a penalty of forfeiture, refund, payment adjustment or termination, no further action is to be taken. The land user's agreement to accept the penalty must be approved by the contracting officer and State conservationist.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of possible violation.</E> (1) When the State conservationist is notified that a contract violation may have occurred that may warrant a penalty of forfeiture, refund, payment adjustment, or termination, he is to notify, in writing, each land user who signed the agreement of the alleged violation. This notice may be personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail. A land user is considered to have <PRTPAGE P="540"/>received the notice at the time of personal receipt acknowledged in writing, at the time of the delivery of a certified or registered letter, or at the time of the return of a certified or registered letter where delivery was refused.</P>
                <P>(2) The notice setting forth the nature of the alleged violation is to give the land user an opportunity to appear at a hearing before a hearing officer designated by the State conservationist. The land user's request for a hearing is to be submitted in writing and must be received in the NRCS field office within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The land user is to be notified in writing by the hearing officer of the time, date, and place for the hearing. The land user is to have no right to a hearing if he does not file a written request for a hearing, or if he or his representative does not appear at the appointed time, unless the hearing officer, at his discretion, permits an appearance. A request for a hearing filed by a land user is considered to be a request by all land users who signed the contract.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> A public hearing is to be conducted to obtain the facts about the alleged violation. The hearing officer is to limit the hearing to relevant facts and evidence and is not to be bound by the strict rules of evidence as required in courts of law. Witnesses may be sworn in at the discretion of the hearing officer.</P>
                <P>(1) The land user or his representative is to be given full opportunity to present oral or documentary evidence about the alleged violation. Likewise, the United States may submit statements and evidence. Individuals not otherwise represented at the hearing may be permitted, at the discretion of the hearing officer, to give information of evidence. The hearing officer, at his discretion, may permit witnesses to be cross-examined.</P>
                <P>(2) The hearing officer is to make a record of the hearing so that the testimony can be summarized. A summary of the testimony may be made if both the land user and the State conservationist agree. A transcript of the hearing is to be made if requested by either the State conservationist or the land user within 10 days of the hearing. If a transcript is requested by the land user, the land user may be assessed the cost of a copy of the transcript.</P>
                <P>(3) The hearing officer is to close the hearing after a reasonable period of time if the land user or his representative is not present at the scheduled time. The hearing officer may, at his discretion, accept information and evidence submitted by others present for the hearing.</P>
                <P>(4) The hearing officer is to furnish the State conservationist with a written report setting forth his findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The report is to include the summary of testimony or transcript made of the hearing and any other information that would aid the State conservationist in reaching his decision.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Decision by State conservationist.</E> The State conservationist is to make a decision after considering the hearing officer's report, including recommendations of the conservation district board if any, and any other information available to him, including, if applicable, the amount of the forfeiture, refund, or payment adjustment. The decision is to state whether the violation is of such a nature as to warrant termination of the contract. The State conservationist is to notify, in writing, each land user who signed the contract of his decision. The State conservationist may authorize or require the reopening of any hearing before a hearing officer for any reason at any time before his decision.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeal to Chief.</E> Any land user affected by a decision of the State conservationist has the right of appeal to the Chief. The appeal and any briefs or statements must be received in the Office of the Chief within 30 days after the land user has received notice of the State conservationist's decision. The State conservationist is to file a brief or statement in the Office of the Chief within 20 days after the land user's brief or statement is received there. The appeal is to be limited to the records and the issues made before the State conservationist. The Chief's decision is final. The decision is to be determined by the record before him and the issues presented in the appeal, and the land user is to be notified in writing.<PRTPAGE P="541"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) If the decision provides for termination of the contract, it is to state that the contract is terminated, that all rights to further cost-share payments under the contract are forfeited, and that cost-share payments received under the contract are to be refunded, but the refund is not to exceed the difference between the estimated value of the land at time of entering into the contract and the value at time of termination. The decision is to state the amount of refund and method of payment.</P>
                <P>(2) If the decision does not provide for termination of the contract, the land user may be required to make a refund of cost-share payments or to accept payment adjustments. The decision is to state the amount of refunds of cost-share payments or payment adjustments. In determining amounts of refund or payment adjustments, the following are to be considered:</P>
                <P>(i) The extent of the violation.</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether the violation was deliberate or the result of negligence or was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the land user.</P>
                <P>(iii) The effect on the program if no refund or payment adjustment is required.</P>
                <P>(iv) The extent to which the land user benefited by the violation.</P>
                <P>(v) The effect of the violation on the contract as a whole.</P>
                <P>(vi) Other considerations including the appropriateness and reasonableness of the refund or payment adjustment.</P>

                <P>(a) Environmental evaluation is an integral part of planning used by NRCS in developing each reclamation plan under this program. Planning includes site inventory and analysis, evaluation of reasonable alternatives, and identification of significant environmental impacts. Major points in planning when NRCS or the land user can make decisions concerning further action are:</P>
                <P>(1) After an evaluation of the application for program assistance to verify eligibility, land user objectives, and priorities for funding.</P>
                <P>(2) After a site-specific inventory and analysis to evaluate feasible treatment alternatives, costs, and environmental impacts.</P>
                <P>(3) After development of an acceptable reclamation plan as a basis for contract.</P>
                <P>(4) Before the signing of a mutually acceptable contract for financial cost-share assistance.</P>

                <P>(a) The RFO will analyze the environmental assessment of the proposed action to determine which of the following classes of action applies. This determination will be recorded and will be available to the public on request.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Actions not requiring a site-specific EIS.</E> All proposed actions and their impacts that are determined to be adequately discussed in the program EIS or determined not to be major Federal actions will not require a site-specific EIS. However, if the assessment reveals that these proposed actions will have significant adverse effects on the quality of the human environment, the RFO will:</P>
                <P>(i) Modify the action to eliminate or mitigate the significant adverse impacts, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Withdraw further Federal assistance if significant adverse impacts cannot be eliminated or mitigated.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Actions requiring a site-specific EIS.</E> A site-specific EIS is required for proposed actions if their impacts are not adequately discussed in the program EIS, and the proposal is determined to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment in accordance with § 650.7(b) of this chapter. When a decision is made to prepare an EIS, a Notice of Intent will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The content and format of the EIS is to be consistent with the format of the program EIS and use scoping and tiering techniques to focus on the significant environmental issues.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Actions excluded from the EIS requirements.</E> Those actions taken to prevent loss of life or property under the extreme danger provisions of priority 1 as described in § 632.12. These actions are determined by a limited environmental assessment that reasonably identifies the possible loss of life or property.</P>

              <P>(5) Lands where implementation of agreement practices would be futile due to on-site or off-site conditions; and</P>
              <P>(6) Land on which the ownership has changed during the 2-year period preceding the first year of the agreement period unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The new ownership was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous owner,</P>
              <P>(ii) The land was acquired by the owner or operator to replace eligible land from which he was displaced because of its acquisition by any Federal, State, or other agency having the right of eminent domain, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The new owner operated the land to be designated for as long as 2 years preceding the first year of the agreement and has control of such land for the agreement period.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The purpose of this part is for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the concurrence of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to set forth regulations to carry out a Rural Clean Water Program (RCWP) under section 35, Pub. L. 95-217; 91 Stat. 1579; 33 U.S.C. 1288.</P>
                <P>(b) The Rural Clean Water Program provides financial and technical assistance to private landowners and operators (participants) having control of rural land. The assistance is provided through long-term contracts (5 to 10 years) to install best management practices (BMP's) in project areas which have critical water quality problems resulting from agricultural activities. The proposed project area must be within a high priority area in an approved agricultural portion of a 208 water quality management plan. Participation in RCWP is voluntary.</P>
                <P>(c) The program is a new USDA program and an extension of existing water-quality management programs of EPA.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 634.2</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The RCWP is designed to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollutants to improve water quality in rural areas to meet water quality standards or water quality goals. The objective is to be achieved in the most cost-effective manner possible in keeping with the provision of adequate supplies of food and fiber and a quality environment.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Administration.</SUBJECT>

                <P>At the national level, the Secretary of Agriculture, with the concurrence of <PRTPAGE P="549"/>the Administrator, EPA, administers RCWP. The Secretary of Agiculture has delegated responsibility for administration of the program (43 FR 8252) to the Administrator, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). NRCS will be assisted by other USDA agencies in accordance with existing authorities.</P>
                <P>(a) A National Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee (NRCWCC), chaired by the Administrator, NRCS, is to assist in carrying out the Rural Clean Water Program.</P>
                <P>(b) At the State level, a State Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee (SRCWCC) is to assist the State Conservationist, NRCS, in administering the program. The State Conservationist will chair the SRCWCC.</P>
                <P>(c) To assure coordination at the project level, a local Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee is to be established at the time the application is developed. An existing local committee may be used, where practicable, to perform the functions of this committee.</P>
                <P>(d) The Administrator, NRCS, through the State Conservationists, NRCS, is to enter into agreements, where practicable, with soil conservation districts, State soil and water conservation agencies, or State water quality agencies to administer all or part of the program for a project area. That portion of program administration to be conducted by these agencies will be defined in the project application and grant agreement. Where this is not practicable, USDA will administer the program in a project area. In those instances where USDA retains administration of the program in a project area, NRCS will enter into agreements for the transfer of funds to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) for the administration of part of the program.</P>

                <P>(1) The grant agreement will provide for payment of cost-sharing for BMP (§ 634.5(j)) and administrative costs (§ 634.5(c)).</P>
                <P>(2) The grant agreement may provide for payment of technical assistance costs when the administering agency has the capability, and the NRCS designates that agency to provide this assistance to RCWP participants.</P>
                <P>(3) The administering agency is to monitor the performance of activities supported by RCWP grant funds to assure that time schedules and participant RCWP contract requirements are being met. Performance goals are to be measured against the terms of the grant agreement and program directives. When NRCS determines that onsite technical inspections, certified completion data, and financial status reports do not provide adequate grant evaluation data, the following information may be requested:</P>
                <P>(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the objectives established for the plan,</P>
                <P>(ii) Reasons why established objectives were not met, and</P>
                <P>(iii) Objectives established for the next reporting period.</P>
                <P>(4) Grant agreements may be amended by mutural agreement of the parties to the agreement. NRCS may unilaterally amend agreements when the sole consideration is a change in the cost and the Administrator, NRCS, based on NRCWCC recommendations, determines that such an adjustment is necessary to carry out the program efficiently and effectively.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Fund transfer agreements.</E> When it is impractical for NRCS to enter into agreements with local soil conservation districts, State soil and water conservation agencies, or State water quality agencies to administer the program in a project area, USDA will retain program administration. In this case, the State Executive Director, ASCS, and the State Conservationist, NRCS, are to enter into an agreement for the transfer of funds to ASCS through county ASC committees for activities included in administrative cost (§ 634.5(c)) and BMP cost (§ 634.5(j)). The following general working arrangements are to apply:</P>
                <P>(1) Administering contracts, making cost-share payment, and program reporting are to be provided by ASCS as the administering agency.</P>
                <P>(2) NRCS, or its designee, with appropriate Federal or State agency support, will provide technical assistance to participants in preparing RCWP contracts and in carrying out their water-quality plans.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreements for services.</E> NRCS may enter into an agreement for services with a State or local agency. The designee must meet the requirements of OMB Circular No. A-102.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Contracts for services.</E> NRCS may enter into contracts for services with individuals or firms for providing technical assistance.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Suspension orders.</E> Work on a project or on a portion or phase of a project for which a grant has been awarded, may be suspended by order of the State Conservationist, NRCS. Suspension does not affect RCWP contracts existing at the time the suspension order is issued, or the administering agency's responsibility to <PRTPAGE P="558"/>make payments under such contracts unless specifically provided for in the suspend order. In no event will the participant's right to cost-share payment be diminished by action taken under this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of suspension orders.</E> Suspension may be required for good cause, such as default by the administering agency, failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the grant, realignment of programs, or advancements in the state of the art.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of suspension orders.</E> Prior to issuance, suspension orders will be discussed with the administering agency and may be appropriately modified, in the light of such discussions. Suspension orders are to include:</P>
                <P>(1) A clear description of the work to be suspended,</P>
                <P>(2) Instructions as to the issuance of further orders by the administering agency for materials or services,</P>

                <P>(4) Instructions as to the administering agency servicing existing RCWP contracts in the project area, and</P>
                <P>(5) Other instructions to the administering agency for minimizing Federal costs.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Issuance of suspension order.</E> Suspension orders are issued by the State Conservationist, NRCS, by letter to the administering agency (certified mail, return receipt requested). A suspension order may not exceed forty-five (45) calendar days.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of suspension order.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a suspension order, the administering agency shall promptly comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work suspension. During the suspension period, NRCS shall either:</P>
                <P>(i) Cancel the suspension order, in full or in part, and authorize resumption of work, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Take action to terminate the work covered by such order as provided by § 634.17.</P>
                <P>(2) If a suspension order is canceled, or the period of the order expires, the administering agency shall promptly resume the suspended work. An equitable adjustment shall be made in the grant period, the project period, or grant amount, or all of these, and the grant agreement may be amended:</P>
                <P>(i) The suspension order results in an increase in the time, or cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of the project; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The administering agency asserts a written claim for such adjustment within thirty (30) days after the end of the period of work suspension. If no written claim is made, NRCS may unilaterally make such adjustments.</P>
                <P>(iii) Reasonable costs resulting from the suspension order shall be allowed in arriving at any terminations settlement.</P>
                <P>(3) Costs incurred by the administering agency after a suspension order is delivered that are not authorized by this section or specifically authorized in writing by the State Conservationist, NRCS, shall not be allowable costs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Termination of grant agreement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Termination agreement or notice.</E> (1) The State Conservationist, NRCS, may, based on evidence of failure to comply with the terms of the grant agreement, issue a notice of intent to terminate the grant agreement. The notice of intent to terminate has the force and effect of extending or modifying the conditions of the suspend order. Any modification of the conditions of the suspend order shall be shown in the notice and discussed with the administering agency. The State Conservationist shall give not less than ten (10) days written notice to the administering agency (certified mail, return receipt requested) of intent to terminate the grant in whole or in part.</P>

                <P>(2) After the administering agency has been afforded an opportunity for consultation, the State Conservationist, NRCS, may request authorization from the Administrator, NRCS, to terminate the grant in whole or in part. If the Administrator, NRCS, concurs in the termination action, the proposed termination notice will be forwarded to the Administrator, EPA, for concurrence.<PRTPAGE P="559"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) After the Administrators, NRCS and EPA, have been informed of any expressed views of the administering agency and concurred in the proposed termination, the State Conservationist, NRCS, may, in writing (certified mail, return receipt requested), terminate the grant in whole or in part.</P>
                <P>(4) Termination of all or part of the grant agreement may be carried out by either execution of a termination agreement by the State Conservationist, NRCS, or issuance of a grant termination notice by the State Conservationist, NRCS. The agreement or notice shall establish the effective date of termination of the grant, the basis for settlement of grant termination costs, and the amount and date of payment of any sums due either party.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Basis for termination.</E> A grant may be terminated by NRCS for good cause subject to negotiation and payment of appropriate termination settlement costs. Cause for termination by NRCS includes:</P>
                <P>(1) Failure by the administering agency to make satisfactory progress toward achieving an adequate level of participation; or other evidence satisfactory to the NRCWCC, Administrator, EPA, and the Administrator, NRCS, that the administering agency has failed or is unable to perform in accordance with the provisions of the grant agreement; or</P>
                <P>(2) Failure through no fault of the administering agency to achieve an adequate level of participation; or other evidence satisfactory to the NRCWCC, Administrator, EPA, and the Administrator, NRCS, that the planned actions approved in the project application cannot be achieved.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of grant termination.</E> (1)(i) In those cases where cause for grant termination is based on the administering agency's failure or inability to perform (§ 634.17(b)(1)), upon termination, the administering agency must refund or credit to the United States that portion of the grant funds paid or owed to the administering agency and allocable to the terminated project work. Funds needed to meet unavoidable commitments may be retained. All other funds, including unexpended cost-sharing monies for existing RCWP contracts executed prior to the termination date, shall be refunded to the United States. The administering agency shall not make any new commitments or enter into any new RCWP contracts. The administering agency shall reduce the amount of other outstanding commitments insofar as possible and report to the State Conservationist, NRCS, the uncommitted balance of funds awarded under the grant. The allowability of termination costs will be determined in conformance with applicable Federal cost principles.</P>
                <P>(ii) Upon termination of a grant agreement, existing RCWP contracts and their related obligations will immediately, and in no case later than 5 calendar days be transferred to the ASCS county office to assure continuity in payments to participants. The State Conservationist, NRCS, will immediately initiate action under § 634.15 to establish a new administering agency for completion of the project.</P>
                <P>(2) In those cases where cause for grant termination is based on failure to achieve the planned actions through no fault of the administering agency, the termination agreement and amended grant agreement are to permit the administering agency to fulfill the obligations of its existing RCWP contracts. The administering agency shall not make any new commitments or enter into any new RCWP contracts without NRCS approval.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Water quality plan.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The participant's water quality plan, developed with technical assistance by the NRCS or its designee, is to include appropriate BMP's identified in the approved agricultural portion of the 208 water quality management plan. Such BMP's must reduce the amount of pollutants that enter a stream or lake by:</P>
                <P>(1) Methods, such as reducing the application rates or changing the application methods of potential pollutants, and</P>
                <P>(2) Methods, such as practices or combinations of practices which prevent potential pollutants from leaving source areas or reduce the amount of potential pollutants that reach a stream or lake after leaving a source area.</P>

                <P>(b) Participant's water quality plans shall as a minimum include BMP's for all critical areas or sources. The plans <PRTPAGE P="561"/>will include BMP's which are required but not cost-shared. Non-cost-shared BMP's, essential for the performance and maintenance of cost-shared BMP's shall be required as a condition of the RCWP contract.</P>
                <P>(c) The participant is responsible for compliance with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws that deal with the participant's nonpoint source water quality problems, such as the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. BMP's required for compliance may be cost shared.</P>
                <P>(d) It is recognized that the participants' water-quality plans upon which the RCWP contracts are to be based may include conservation measures other than those related to water quality improvement. These measures are not eligible for cost sharing under this program. The installation of such conservation measures will not be required as a condition of the RCWP contract and will not be shown in the time schedules for implementing BMP's.</P>
                <P>(e) Time schedules for implementing BMP's are to be provided in the participant's water quality plan. The time schedule is to establish the length of the contract within the 5 to 10 year period established by law.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Cost sharing.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The portion of BMP cost (including labor) to be cost shared shall be that part which the Secretary determines is necessary and appropriate. The value of land upon which BMP's are applied, or the participant's water rights, cannot be considered a part of the participant's share of the cost.</P>
                <P>(b) The administering agency, in consultation with the county ASC committee(s), soil conservation district(s), and designated management agency will annually set maximum individual BMP cost-share levels for the project area. However, the Federal share of the cost of the contract cannot exceed 50 percent unless a variance has been granted.</P>
                <P>(c) Recommended variances exceeding the 50 percent level must be in the public interest and based on the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) The main benefits to be derived from measures are related to improving offsite water quality, and</P>
                <P>(2) The matching share requirements would place a burden on the landowner or operator which would probably prevent him or her from participating in the program.</P>
                <P>(d) BMP's to be cost shared must have a positive effect on water quality by reducing the amount of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants that enter a stream or lake.</P>
                <P>(e) Cost sharing is not to be made available for:</P>
                <P>(1) Measures installed primarily for bringing additional land into crop production, including but not limited to land clearing and brush removal;</P>
                <P>(2) Measures installed primarily for increasing production on existing cropland, including but not limited to bedding, field ditches, open drains, and tile drains;</P>
                <P>(3) Measures having flood protection as the primary purpose, including but not limited to open channels, clearing and snagging, and obstruction removal;</P>
                <P>(4) Structural measures authorized for installation under Pub. L. 83-566.</P>
                <P>(f) The Federal cost-share level is not to be reduced by the contribution of a State or subdivision thereof. Total payments from Federal, State, and local sources for a BMP may not exceed the total cost of that BMP.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Cost-share payment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Participants are to obtain or contract for materials or services as needed to install BMPs. Federal Cost-share payments are to be made by the administering agency upon certification by the District Conservationist, NRCS, or its designee, that the BMPs, or an identifiable unit thereof, have been properly carried out and meet the appropriate standards and specifications.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment maximum.</E> The maximum total Federal cost-share payment to a participant shall be limited to $50,000. Exceptions to this limit may be made by the administering agency with concurrence of the Administrator, NRCS, upon recommedation of the NRCWCC, where it determines that the main benefits to be derived are essential for meeting the water quality objectives in the project area.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Basis for cost-share payment.</E> (1) Cost-share payments are to be made by the administering agency at the cost-share percentage and by one of the following methods designated by the administering agency and set out in the contract:</P>
                <P>(i) Average cost, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Actual cost not to exceed average cost.</P>
                <P>(2) If the average cost at the time of starting the installation of a BMP or identifiable unit is less than the costs specified in the contract, payment is to be at the lower rate. If the costs at the start of installation are higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A modification will be necessary if the higher cost results in a significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. Cost-share payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase is approved.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Average cost development.</E> Average costs are to be developed by the administering agency for each project using cost data from the local area. These costs should be reviewed by the SRCWCC for consistency with average costs in other USDA programs. The average cost list is to be updated annually by the administering agency.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Application for payment.</E> Cost-share payments can be made by the administering agency after a participant has carried out a BMP or an identifiable unit of a BMP. Application for payment must be submitted to the administering agency, be certified by the NRCS or its designee, and be supported by such cost receipts as are required by <PRTPAGE P="564"/>the administering agency. It is the participant's responsibility to apply for payments.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Authorizations for payments to suppliers.</E> (1) The contract may authorize that part or all of the Federal cost share for a BMP or an identifiable unit be made directly to suppliers of materials or services. The materials or services must be delivered or performed before payment is made.</P>
                <P>(2) Federal cost shares will not be in excess of the cost share attributable to the material or service used or not in excess of the cost share for all identifiable units as may be requested by the participant.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Material inspection and analysis.</E> When authorizations for payments to suppliers are specified, the administering agency, its representatives, or the Government reserve the right to inspect, sample, and analyze materials or services prior to their use.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Assignments, set-offs, and claims.</E> (1) A State or local administering agency may allow the assignment of payments to the extent provided by State law. When ASCS is designated as the administering agency, assignments by any participant who may be entitled to cost-share payment under the program are prohibited unless they are made in accordance with the provisions of section 203, Title 31, U.S.C., as amended, and section 15, Title 41, U.S.C., as amended.</P>
                <P>(2) If any participant to whom compensation is payable under RCWP is indebted to the United States and such indebtedness is listed on the county register of indebtedness maintained by the County ASC committee, the compensation due the participant must be used (set-off) to reduce that idebtedness. Indebtedness to USDA is to be given first consideration. Deductions for setoffs involving a nonresident alien shall be made as provided by 26 U.S.C. 871. Setoffs made pursuant to this section are not to deprive the participant of any right to contest the justness of the indebtedness involved, either by administrative appeal or by legal action.</P>
                <P>(3) Any cost-share payment due any participant shall be allowed without deduction of claims for advances except as provided for above and without regard to any claim or lien against any crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the participant or any other creditor.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Access to land unit and records.</E> Any authorized administering agency, or NRCS employees or agents, shall have the right of access at reasonable times to land under application or contract, and the right to examine any program records to ascertain the accuracy of any representations made in the application or contract. This is limited to the right to furnish technical assistance and to inspect work performed under the contract.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Suspension of payments.</E> No cost-share payments will be made pending a decision on whether or not a contract violation has occurred.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Ineligible payments.</E> The filing of requests for payment for BMP's not carried out, or for BMP's carried out in such a manner that they do not meet contract specifications, constitutes a violation of the contract.</P>

              <P>(a) The State Conservationist may, independently or by mutual agreement with the parties to the cost-share agreement, terminate the cost-share agreement where:</P>
              <P>(1) The parties to the cost-share agreement are unable to comply with the terms of the cost-share agreement as the result of conditions beyond their control;</P>
              <P>(2) Termination of the cost-share agreement would, as determined by the State Conservationist, be in the public interest; or</P>
              <P>(3) A participant fails to correct a violation of a cost-share agreement within the period provided by NRCS in accordance with § 636.13.</P>
              <P>(b) If NRCS terminates a cost-share agreement, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section the State Conservationist may allow the participant to retain a portion of any payments received appropriate to the effort the participant has made to comply with the contract.</P>

              <P>(1) NRCS may require a participant to provide only a partial refund of the <PRTPAGE P="579"/>payments received if a previously implemented conservation activity can function independently, and is not adversely affected by the violation or the absence of other conservation activities that would have been implemented under the cost-share agreement; and</P>
              <P>(2) The State Conservationist will have the option to waive all or part of the liquidated damages assessed, depending upon the circumstances of the case.</P>
              <P>(c) When making termination decisions, NRCS may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that reflects:</P>
              <P>(1) The good faith effort of the participant to comply with the cost-share agreement; or</P>
              <P>(2) The existence of hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance. If a participant claims hardship, that claim must be documented and cannot have existed when the applicant applied for participation in the program.</P>

              <P>(a) If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of a cost-share agreement, NRCS will give the parties to the cost-share agreement notice of the violation and a minimum of 60 days to correct the violation and comply with the terms of the cost-share agreement and attachments thereto.</P>
              <P>(b) If the participant fails to correct the violation of a cost-share agreement within the period provided by NRCS under paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS may terminate the agreement and require the participant to refund all or part of any of the funds issued under that cost-share agreement, plus interest, and may assess liquidated damages as indicated in the cost-share agreement appendix, as well as require the participant to forfeit all rights to any future payment under the agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) If NRCS terminates a cost-share agreement due to breach of contract, the participant will forfeit all rights to future payments under the agreement, may be required to pay liquidated damages in an amount determined by the State Conservationist in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and will refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest. Participants violating WHIP cost-share agreements may be determined ineligible for future NRCS-administered conservation program funding.</P>

              <P>(b) A participant will refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest, as determined by NRCS, with respect to all NRCS cost-share agreements to which they are a party if they are determined to have knowingly:</P>
              <P>(1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Environmental services credits for conservation improvements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>USDA recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing conservation activities funded through WHIP, and that environmental credits may be gained as a result of implementing activities compatible with the purposes of a WHIP cost-share agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest on any such credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that program purposes are met and the requirements for WHIP funded improvements are met and maintained consistent with §§ 636.8 and 636.9. Where activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect land covered under a WHIP cost-share agreement, participants are highly encouraged to request a compatibility assessment from NRCS prior to entering into such agreements. The WHIP cost-share agreement may be modified, in accordance with policies outlined in § 636.10, provided the modification meets WHIP purposes and is in compliance with this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This rule prescribes procedures by which NRCS is to implement the provisions of NEPA. The Natural Resources Conservation Service recognizes NEPA as the national charter for protection, restoration, and enhancement of the human environment. NEPA establishes policy, sets goals (Section 101), and provides means (Section 102) for carrying out this policy.</P>
                <P>(b) The procedures included in this rule supplement CEQ's NEPA regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508. CEQ regulations that need no additional elaboration to address NRCS-assisted actions are not repeated in this rule, although the regulations are cited as references. The procedures include some overlap with CEQ regulations. This is done to highlight items of importance for NRCS. This does not supersede the existing body of NEPA regulations.</P>
                <P>(c) These procedures provide that—</P>
                <P>(1) Environmental information is to be available to citizens before decisions are made about actions that significantly affect the human environment;</P>
                <P>(2) NRCS-assisted actions are to be supported to the extent possible by accurate scientific analyses that are technically acceptable to NRCS;</P>
                <P>(3) NRCS-prepared NEPA documents are to be available for public scrutiny; and</P>
                <P>(4) Documents are to concentrate on the issues that are timely and significant to the action in question rather than amassing needless detail.</P>
                <P>(d) Procedures for implementing NEPA are designed to ensure that environmental consequences are considered in decisionmaking. They allow NRCS to assist individuals and nonfederal public entities to take actions that protect, enhance, and restore environmental quality.</P>
                <P>(e) These procedures make possible the early identification of actions that have significant effects on the human environment to avoid delays in decisionmaking.</P>

                <P>This rule applies to all NRCS-assisted programs including the uninstalled parts of approved projects that are not covered by environmental documents prepared under previous rules for compliance with NEPA. It is effective on the date of publication of the final rule. NRCS is to consult with CEQ in the manner prescribed by 40 CFR 1506.11 if it is necessary to take emergency actions.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">NRCS mission.</E> The NRCS mission is to provide assistance that will allow <PRTPAGE P="583"/>use and management of ecological, cultural, natural, physical, social, and economic resources by striving for a balance between use, management, conservation, and preservation of the Nation's natural resource base. The NRCS mission is reemphasized and expanded to carry out the mandate of section 101(b) of NEPA, within other legislative constraints, in all its programs of Federal assistance. NRCS will continue to improve and coordinate its plans, functions, programs, and recommendations on resource use so that Americans, as stewards of the environment for succeeding generations—</P>
                <P>(1) Can maintain safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings that support diversity of individual choices; and</P>
                <P>(2) Are encouraged to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of soil, water, and related resources without degradation to the environment, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">NRCS environmental policy.</E> NRCS is to administer Federal assistance within the following overall environmental policies:</P>
                <P>(1) Provide assistance to Americans that will motivate them to maintain equilibrium among their ecological, cultural, natural, physical, social, and economic resources by striving for a balance between conserving and preserving the Nation's natural resource base.</P>
                <P>(2) Provide technical and financial assistance through a systematic interdisciplinary approach to planning and decisionmaking to insure a balance between the natural, physical, and social sciences.</P>
                <P>(3) Consider environmental quality equal to economic, social, and other factors in decisionmaking.</P>
                <P>(4) Insure that plans satisfy identified needs and at the same time minimize adverse effects of planned actions on the human environment through interdisciplinary planning before providing technical and financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(5) Counsel with highly qualified and experienced specialists from within and outside NRCS in many technical fields as needed.</P>
                <P>(6) Encourage broad public participation in defining environmental quality objectives and needs.</P>
                <P>(7) Identify and make provisions for detailed survey, recovery, protection, or preservation of unique cultural resources that otherwise may be irrevocably lost or destroyed by NRCS-assisted project actions, as required by Historic Preservation legislation and/or Executive Order.</P>
                <P>(8) Encourage local sponsors to review with interested publics the operation and maintenance programs of completed projects to insure that environmental quality is not degraded.</P>
                <P>(9) Advocate the retention of important farmlands and forestlands, prime rangeland, wetlands, or other lands designated by State or local governments. Whenever proposed conversions are caused or encouraged by actions or programs of a Federal agency, licensed by or require approval by a Federal agency, or are inconsistent with local or State government plans, provisions are to be sought to insure that such lands are not irreversibly converted to other uses unless other national interests override the importance of preservation or otherwise outweigh the environmental benefits derived from their protection. In addition, the preservation of farmland in general provides the benefits of open space, protection of scenery, wildlife habitat, and in some cases, recreation opportunities and controls on urban sprawl.</P>
                <P>(10) Advocate actions that reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize effects of floods on human safety, health, and welfare; and restore and preserve the natural and beneficial functions and values of flood plains.</P>
                <P>(11) Advocate and assist in the reclamation of abandoned surface-mined lands and in planning for the extraction of coal and other nonrenewable resources to facilitate restoration of the land to its prior productivity as mining is completed.</P>
                <P>(12) Advocate the protection of valuable wetlands, threatened and endangered animal and plant species and their habitats, and designated ecosystems.</P>

                <P>(13) Advocate the conservation of natural and manmade scenic resources to insure that NRCS-assisted programs <PRTPAGE P="584"/>or activities protect and enhance the visual quality of the landscape.</P>
                <P>(14) Advocate and assist in actions to preserve and enhance the quality of the Nation's waters.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Channel realignment.</E> Channel realignment includes the construction of a new channel or a new alignment and may include the clearing, snagging, widening, and/or deepening of the existing channel. (Channel Modification Guidelines, 43 FR 8276).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental assessment</E> (<E T="03">EA</E>). (40 CFR 1508.9)</P>
                <P>(1) An environmental assessment is a concise public document for which a Federal agency is responsible that—</P>
                <P>(i) Briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.</P>
                <P>(ii) Aids an agency's compliance with the Act when no environmental impact statement is necessary.</P>
                <P>(iii) Facilitates preparation of an environmental impact statement when one is necessary.</P>
                <P>(2) An environmental assessment includes brief discussions of the need for the proposal, alternatives as required by section of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a list of agencies and persons consulted.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Environmental evaluation.</E> The environmental evaluation (EE) (formerly referred to by NRCS as an environmental assessment) is the part of planning that inventories and estimates the potential effects on the human environment of alternative solutions to resource problems. A wide range of environmental data together with social and economic information is considered in determining whether a proposed action is a major Federal action significantly affecting the human environment. The environmental evaluation for a program, regulation, or individual action is used to determine the need for an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. It also aids in the consideration of alternatives and in the identification of available resources.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Federally-assisted actions.</E> These actions are planned and carried out by individuals, groups, or local units of government largely on nonfederal land with technical and/or financial assistance provided by NRCS.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Interdisciplinary planning.</E> NRCS uses an interdisciplinary environmental evaluation and planning approach in which specialists and groups having different technical expertise act as a team to jointly evaluate existing and future environmental quality. The interdisciplinary group considers structure and function of natural resource systems, complexity of problems, and the economic, social, and environmental effects of alternative actions. Public participation is an essential part of effective interdisciplinary planning. Even if an NRCS employee provides direct assistance to an individual land user, the basic data used is a result of interdisciplinary development of guide and planning criteria.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Nonproject actions.</E> Nonproject actions consist of technical and/or financial assistance provided to an individual, group, or local unit of government by NRCS primarily through a cooperative agreement with a local conservation district, such as land treatment recommended in the Conservation Operations, Great Plains Conservation, Rural Abandoned Mine, and Rural Clean Water Programs. These actions may include consultations, advice, engineering, and other technical <PRTPAGE P="585"/>assistance that land users usually cannot accomplish by themselves. Nonproject technical and/or financial assistance may result in the land user installing field terraces, waterways, field leveling, onfarm drainage systems, farm ponds, pasture management, conservation tillage, critical area stablization and other conservation practices.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent</E> (<E T="03">NOI</E>) (<E T="03">40 CFR 1508.22</E>). A notice of intent is a brief statement inviting public reaction to the decision by the responsible Federal official to prepare an EIS for a major Federal action. The notice of intent is to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> circulated to interested agencies, groups, individuals, and published in one or more newspapers serving the area of the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Project actions.</E> A project action is a formally planned undertaking that is carried out within a specified area by sponsors for the benefit of the general public. Project sponsors are units of government having the legal authority and resources to install, operate, and/or maintain works of improvement.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Record of Decision.</E> (ROD) (40 CFR 1505.2). A record of decision is a concise written rationale by the RFO regarding implementation of a proposed action requiring an environmental impact statement. This was previously defined by NRCS as a Statement of Findings (SOF).</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Responsible Federal official (RFO).</E> The NRCS Administrator is the responsible Federal official (RFO) for compliance with NEPA regarding proposed legislation, programs, legislative reports, regulations, and program EIS's. NRCS state conservationists (STC's) are the RFO's for compliance with the provisions of NEPA in other NRCS-assisted actions.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Significantly.</E> (40 CFR 1508.27) “Significantly” as used in NEPA requires considerations of both context and intensity:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Context.</E> This means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. For instance, for a site-specific action, significance usually depends on the effects in the locale rather than in the world as a whole. Both short- and long-term effects are relevant.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Intensity.</E> This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible officials must bear in mind that more than one agency may make decisions about partial aspects of a major action.</P>
                <FP>The following should be considered in evaluating intensity:</FP>
                <P>(i) Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant effect may exist even if the Federal agency believes that on balance the effect will be beneficial.</P>
                <P>(ii) The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety.</P>
                <P>(iii) Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas.</P>
                <P>(iv) The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial.</P>
                <P>(v) The degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.</P>
                <P>(vi) The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects or represents a decision in principle about a future consideration.</P>
                <P>(vii) Whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts. Significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment. Significance cannot be avoided by terming an action temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.</P>
                <P>(viii) The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.</P>

                <P>(ix) The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat that has been determined to be critical <PRTPAGE P="586"/>under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended.</P>
                <P>(x) Whether the action threatens a violation of Federal, State, or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Finding of no significant impact (FNSI).</E> (40 CFR 1508.13) “Finding of No Significant Impact” means a document by a Federal agency briefly presenting the reasons why an action not otherwise excluded (§ 1508.4) will not have a significant effect on the human environment, and an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared. It shall include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and shall note any other environmental documents related to it (§ 1501.7(a)(5)). If the assessment is included, the finding need not repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may incorporate it by reference.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Environmental evaluation (EE) integrates environmental concerns throughout the planning, installation, and operation of NRCS-assisted projects. The EE applies to all assistance provided by NRCS, but planning intensity, public involvement, and documentation of actions vary according to the scope of the action. NRCS begins consideration of environmental concerns when information gathered during the environmental evaluation is used:</P>
                <P>(1) To identify environmental concerns that may be affected, gather baseline data, and predict effects of alternative courses of actions;</P>
                <P>(2) To provide data to applicants for use in establishing objectives commensurate with the scope and complexity of the proposed action;</P>
                <P>(3) To assist in the development of alternative courses of action; (40 CFR 1502.14). In NRCS-assisted project actions, nonstructural, water conservation, and other alternatives that are in keeping with the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards are considered, if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(4) To perform other related investigations and analyses as needed, including economic evaluation, engineering investigations, etc.</P>

                <P>(a) Some NRCS programs or parts of programs do not normally create significant individual or cumulative impacts on the human environment. Therefore, an EA or EIS is not needed. These are data gathering and interpretation programs and include:</P>
                <P>(1) Soil Survey—7 CFR part 611;</P>
                <P>(2) Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasts—7 CFR part 612;</P>

                <P>(5) River Basin Studies under section 6 of Pub. L. 83-566 as amended—7 CFR part 621.</P>
                <P>(b) When any new action is planned under the programs identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the EE performed by the RFO is to identify extraordinary circumstances that might lead to significant individual or cumulative impacts. Actions that have potential for significant impacts on the human environment are not categorically excluded.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) The NRCS restoration and conservation actions and activities identified in paragraph (d) of this section are eligible for categorical exclusion and require the RFO to document a determination that a categorical exclusion applies. Agency personnel will use the EE review process detailed in § 650.5 to evaluate proposed activities for extraordinary circumstances and document the determination that the categorical exclusion applies. The extraordinary circumstances address the significance criteria provided in 40 CFR 1508.27.</P>
                <P>(2) The extraordinary circumstances identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section include:</P>
                <P>(i) The proposed action cannot cause significant effects on public health or safety.</P>
                <P>(ii) The proposed action cannot significantly affect unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic properties or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, floodplains, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas.</P>
                <P>(iii) The effects of the proposed action on the quality of the human environment cannot be highly controversial.</P>
                <P>(iv) The proposed action cannot have highly uncertain effects, including potential unique or unknown risks on the human environment.</P>
                <P>(v) The proposed action cannot include activities or conservation practices that establish a potential precedent for future actions with significant impacts.</P>
                <P>(vi) The proposed action is known to have or reasonably cannot be expected to have potentially significant environment impacts to the quality of the human environment either individually or cumulatively over time.</P>
                <P>(vii) The proposed action cannot cause or promote the introduction of invasive species or have a significant adverse effect on any of the following special environmental concerns not previously identified in paragraph (c)(2)(B) of this section, such as: endangered and threatened species, environmental justice communities as defined in Executive Order 12898, wetlands, other waters of the United States, wild and scenic rivers, air quality, migratory birds, and bald and golden eagles.</P>
                <P>(viii) The proposed action will not violate Federal or other applicable law and requirements for the protection of the environment.</P>
                <P>(3) In the absence of any extraordinary circumstances as determined through NRCS' EE review process, the activities will be able to proceed without preparation of an EA or EIS. Where extraordinary circumstances are determined to exist, the categorical exclusion will not apply, and the appropriate documentation for compliance with NEPA will be prepared. Prior to determining that a proposed action is categorically excluded under paragraph (d) of this section, the proposed action must:</P>
                <P>(i) Be designed to mitigate soil erosion, sedimentation, and downstream flooding;</P>
                <P>(ii) Require disturbed areas to be vegetated with adapted species that are neither invasive nor noxious;</P>
                <P>(iii) Be based on current Federal principals of natural stream dynamics and processes, such as those presented in the Federal Interagency Stream Corridor Restoration Working Group document, “Stream Corridor Restoration, Principles, Processes, and Practices;”</P>
                <P>(iv) Incorporate the applicable NRCS conservation practice standards as found in the Field Office Technical Guide;</P>
                <P>(v) Not require substantial dredging, excavation, or placement of fill; and</P>
                <P>(vi) Not involve a significant risk of exposure to toxic or hazardous substances.</P>

                <P>(d) The use of the following categorical exclusions for a proposed action <PRTPAGE P="589"/>does not waive NRCS compliance with any applicable legal requirement including, but not limited to, the National Historical Preservation Act or the Endangered Species Act. The following categorical exclusions are available for application to proposed actions provided the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section are met:</P>
                <P>(1) Planting appropriate herbaceous and woody vegetation, which does not include noxious weeds or invasive plants, on disturbed sites to restore and maintain the sites ecological functions and services;</P>
                <P>(2) Removing dikes and associated appurtenances (such as culverts, pipes, valves, gates, and fencing) to allow waters to access floodplains to the extent that existed prior to the installation of such dikes and associated appurtenances;</P>
                <P>(3) Plugging and filling excavated drainage ditches to allow hydrologic conditions to return to pre-drainage conditions to the extent practicable;</P>
                <P>(4) Replacing and repairing existing culverts, grade stabilization, and water control structures and other small structures that were damaged by natural disasters where there is no new depth required and only minimal dredging, excavation, or placement of fill is required;</P>
                <P>(5) Restoring the natural topographic features of agricultural fields that were altered by farming and ranching activities for the purpose of restoring ecological processes;</P>
                <P>(6) Removing or relocating residential, commercial, and other public and private buildings and associated structures constructed in the 100-year floodplain or within the breach inundation area of an existing dam or other flood control structure in order to restore natural hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation, vegetation, or reduce hazards posed to public safety;</P>
                <P>(7) Removing storm debris and sediment following a natural disaster where there is a continuing and eminent threat to public health or safety, property, and natural and cultural resources and removal is necessary to restore lands to pre-disaster conditions to the extent practicable. Excavation will not exceed the pre-disaster condition;</P>

                <P>(8) Stabilizing stream banks and associated structures to reduce erosion through bioengineering techniques following a natural disaster to restore pre-disaster conditions to the extent practicable, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> utilization of living and nonliving plant materials in combination with natural and synthetic support materials, such as rocks, rip-rap, geo-textiles, for slope stabilization, erosion reduction, and vegetative establishment and establishment of appropriate plant communities (bank shaping and planting, brush mattresses, log, root wad, and boulder stabilization methods);</P>
                <P>(9) Repairing or maintenance of existing small structures or improvements (including structures and improvements utilized to restore disturbed or altered wetland, riparian, in stream, or native habitat conditions). Examples of such activities include the repair or stabilization of existing stream crossings for livestock or human passage, levees, culverts, berms, dikes, and associated appurtenances;</P>
                <P>(10) Constructing small structures or improvements for the restoration of wetland, riparian, in stream, or native habitats. Examples of activities include installation of fences and construction of small berms, dikes, and associated water control structures;</P>
                <P>(11) Restoring an ecosystem, fish and wildlife habitat, biotic community, or population of living resources to a determinable pre-impact condition;</P>
                <P>(12) Repairing or maintenance of existing constructed fish passageways, such as fish ladders or spawning areas impacted by natural disasters or human alteration;</P>
                <P>(13) Repairing, maintaining, or installing fish screens to existing structures;</P>
                <P>(14) Repairing or maintaining principal spillways and appurtenances associated with existing serviceable dams, originally constructed to NRCS standards, in order to meet current safety standards. Work will be confined to the existing footprint of the dam, and no major change in reservoir or downstream operations will result;</P>

                <P>(15) Repairing or improving (deepening/widening/armoring) existing auxiliary/emergency spillways associated with dams, originally constructed to <PRTPAGE P="590"/>NRCS standards, in order to meet current safety standards. Work will be confined to the dam or abutment areas, and no major change in reservoir or downstream operation will result;</P>
                <P>(16) Repairing embankment slope failures on structures, originally built to NRCS standards, where the work is confined to the embankment or abutment areas;</P>
                <P>(17) Increasing the freeboard (which is the height from the auxiliary (emergency) spillway crest to the top of embankment) of an existing dam or dike, originally built to NRCS standards, by raising the top elevation in order to meet current safety and performance standards. The purpose of the safety standard and associated work is to ensure that during extreme rainfall events, flows are confined to the auxiliary/emergency spillway so that the existing structure is not overtopped which may result in a catastrophic failure. Elevating the top of the dam will not result in an increase to lake or stream levels. Work will be confined to the existing dam and abutment areas, and no major change in reservoir operations will result. Examples of work may include the addition of fill material such as earth or gravel or placement of parapet walls;</P>
                <P>(18) Modifying existing residential, commercial, and other public and private buildings to prevent flood damages, such as elevating structures or sealing basements to comply with current State safety standards and Federal performance standards;</P>
                <P>(19) Undertaking minor agricultural practices to maintain and restore ecological conditions in floodplains after a natural disaster or on lands impacted by human alteration. Examples of these practices include: mowing, haying, grazing, fencing, off-stream watering facilities, and invasive species control which are undertaken when fish and wildlife are not breeding, nesting, rearing young, or during other sensitive timeframes;</P>
                <P>(20) Implementing soil control measures on existing agricultural lands, such as grade stabilization structures (pipe drops), sediment basins, terraces, grassed waterways, filter strips, riparian forest buffer, and critical area planting; and</P>
                <P>(21) Implementing water conservation activities on existing agricultural lands, such as minor irrigation land leveling, irrigation water conveyance (pipelines), irrigation water control structures, and various management practices.</P>

                <P>The following are categories of NRCS action used to determine whether or not an EIS is to be prepared.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">An EIS is required for:</E>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Projects that include stream channel realignment or work to modify channel capacity by deepening or widening where significant aquatic or wildlife habitat exists. The EE will determine if the channel supports significant aquatic or wildlife habitat;</P>
                <P>(2) Projects requiring Congressional action;</P>
                <P>(3) Broad Federal assistance programs administered by NRCS when the environmental evaluation indicates there may be significant cumulative impacts on the human environment (§ 650.7(e)); and</P>
                <P>(4) Other major Federal actions that are determined after environmental evaluation to affect significantly the quality of the human environment (§ 650.7(b)). If it is difficult to determine whether there is a significant impact on the human environment, it may be necessary to complete the EE and prepare an EA in order to decide if an EIS is required.</P>
                <P>(b) The RFO is to determine the need for an EIS for each action, program, or regulation. An environmental evaluation, using a systematic interdisciplinary analysis and evaluation of data and information responding to the five provisions of Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, will assist the RFO in deciding if the action requires the preparation of an EIS. In analyzing and evaluating environmental concerns, the RFO will answer the following questions:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Environmental impact.</E> Will the proposed action significantly affect the quality of the human environment (40 CFR 1508.14)? For example, will it significantly alter or destroy valuable <PRTPAGE P="591"/>wetlands, important farmlands, cultural resources, or threatened and endangered species? Will it affect social values, water quality, fish and wildlife habitats, or wilderness and scenic areas?</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided.</E> What are the important environmental amenities that would be lost if the proposed action were implemented?</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternatives.</E> Are there alternatives that would achieve the planning objectives but avoid adverse environmental effects?</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Short-term uses versus long-term productivity.</E> Will the proposed actions, in combination with other actions, sacrifice the enhancement of significant long-term productivity as a tradeoff for short-term uses?</P>

                <P>(c) Criteria for determining the need for a program EIS:</P>
                <P>(1) A program EIS is required if the environmental evaluation reveals that actions carried out under the program have individually insignificant but cumulatively significant environmental impacts.</P>
                <P>(2) A project EIS, in lieu of a program EIS, is required if the environmental evaluation reveals that actions carried out under the program will have both individually and cumulatively significant environmental impacts. (7 CFR Parts 620 through 623 and 640 through 643).</P>
                <P>(d) The RFO, through the process of tiering, is to determine if a site-specific EA or EIS is required for an individually significant action that is included in a program EIS.</P>

                <P>An environmental assessment (EA) is to be prepared for:</P>
                <P>(a) Land and water resource projects that are not included in § 650.7(a) (1) through (4) for which State and local units of government receive Federal technical and financial assistance from NRCS (7 CFR parts 620 through 623; and 640 through 643); and</P>

                <SUBJECT>NEPA and interagency planning.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Lead agency.</E> (1) NRCS is to be the lead agency for actions under programs it administers. If the actions affect more than one State, the NRCS Administrator is to designate one NRCS state conservationist as the RFO.</P>
                <P>(2) NRCS normally takes the role of lead agency in actions that share program responsibilities among USDA agencies if NRCS provides the majority of funds for the actions. If the lead agency role is in question, the role of NRCS and other USDA agencies is to be determined by the USDA Environmental Coordinator, Office of Environmental Quality Activities.</P>
                <P>(3) If NRCS and Federal agencies outside USDA cannot agree on which will be the lead agency and which will be the cooperating agencies, the procedures in 40 CFR 1501.5(e) are to be followed.</P>
                <P>(4) NRCS, as lead agency, is to coordinate the participation of all concerned agencies in developing the EIS according to the provisions of 40 CFR 1501.6(a).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cooperating agencies.</E> (1) NRCS is to request, as appropriate, the assistance of cooperating agencies in preparing the environmental evaluation. This assistance will broaden the expertise in the planning and help to avoid <PRTPAGE P="592"/>future conflict. NRCS is to request assistance in determining the scope of issues to be addressed and identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action from Federal agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise.</P>
                <P>(2) NRCS is to act as a cooperating agency if requested. NRCS may request to be designated as a cooperating agency if proposed actions may affect areas of NRCS expertise, such as prime farmlands, soils, erosion control, and agricultural sources of nonpoint pollution. NRCS, as a cooperating agency, is to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.6(b) to the extent possible depending on funds, personnel, and priority. If insufficient funds or other resources prevent NRCS from participating fully as a cooperating agency, NRCS is to request the lead agency to provide funds or other resources which will allow full participation.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Scoping.</E> See 40 CFR 1501.7 for a definition of scoping.</P>
                <P>(1) NRCS is to use scoping to identify and categorize significant environmental issues in its environmental evaluation. Formalized scoping is used to insure that an analytical EIS can be prepared that will reduce paperwork and avoid delay. Scoping allows NRCS to obtain the assistance and consultation of affected agencies that have special expertise or legal jurisdiction in the proposed action. If early environmental evaluation identifies a need for an EIS, NRCS is to publish a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS. The NOI is to request the assistance of all interested agencies, groups, and persons in determining the scope of the evaluation of the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(2) Normally a scoping meeting is held and Federal, State, or local agencies that have special expertise or legal jurisdiction in resource values that may be significantly affected are requested to participate. The scoping meeting will identify agencies that may become cooperating agencies.</P>
                <P>(3) In the scoping meeting, the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to be evaluated and included in the EIS as defined in (40 CFR 1508.25) are to be determined. Tiering (40 CFR 1508.28) may be used to define the relation of the proposed statement to other statements.</P>
                <P>(4) Periodic meetings of the cooperating agencies are to be held at important decisionmaking points to provide timely interagency, interdisciplinary participation.</P>
                <P>(5) Scoping is to include the items listed in 40 CFR 1501.7(a) and may also include any of the activities in 40 CFR 1501.7(b). Appropriate, timely requests and notification are to be made to promote public participation in scoping in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) The RFO through the scoping process will set time and page limits as prescribed in 40 CFR 1501.8. Time and page limits are established by NRCS in consultation with sponsors and others according to the projected availability of resources. The RFO is to make the applicant aware of the possible need for revising time and page limits because of changes in resources.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Public participation</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Public participation activities begin early in the EE and are to be appropriate to the proposed action. For example, extensive public participation activities are required in the implementation of new programs and project actions, but limited public participation is appropriate for nonproject technical and financial assistance programs on nonfederal land.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Early public involvement.</E> The public is to be invited and encouraged to participate in the early stages of planning, including the consideration of the potential effects of NRCS-assisted actions on significant environmental resources such as wetlands, flood plains, cultural values, endangered species, important farmland.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Project activities.</E> The following are general considerations for providing opportunities for public participation:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Identification of interested public.</E> The interested public consisting of but not limited to individuals, groups, organizations, and government agencies are to be identified, sought out, and encouraged to participate in and contribute to interdisciplinary planning and environmental evaluation.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Public notices.</E> (40 CFR 1506.6) If the effects of an action are primarily of local concern, notice of each public <PRTPAGE P="593"/>meeting or hearing should be: Submitted to State and areawide clearinghouses pursuant to OMB Circular A-95 (revised); submitted to Indian tribes if they are interested; published in local newspapers; distributed through other local media; provided to potentially interested community organizations including small business associations; published in newsletters that may be expected to reach potentially interested persons; mailed directly to owners and occupants of nearby or affected property; and posted onsite and offsite in the area where the action is to be located.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">State statutes.</E> If official action by the local units of government cooperating in the proposal is governed by State statute, the public notice and mailing requirement of the statute is to be followed. If the effects of an action are of national concern, notice is to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and mailed to national organizations reasonably expected to be interested.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Public meetings.</E> The RFO, after consultation with the sponsors, is to determine when public meetings or hearings are to be held. Public meetings may be in the form of a workshop, tour, open house, etc. Public involvement will include early discussion of flood-plain management and protection of wetlands, where appropriate. Environmental information is to be presented and discussed along with other appropriate information. To the extent practical, pertinent information should be made available before the meetings.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The RFO is to maintain a reviewable record of public participation in the environmental evaluation process.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonproject activities.</E> Public participation in the planning and application of conservation practices with individual land users is accomplished primarily through conservation districts. These districts are governed by boards of supervisors directors, commissioners, etc., who are elected and/or appointed to insure that soil, water, related resources, and environmental qualities in the district are maintained and improved. The public is to be encouraged to participate in the development of long-range district programs and district annual plans. The district keeps the public informed through public meetings, district newsletters, news stories, radio and television programs, and annual reports.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Adoption of an EIS prepared by a cooperating agency.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If NRCS adopts an EIS prepared by another Federal or State agency, the RFO is to review the document to insure that it meets the requirements of the CEQ regulations and NRCS-NEPA procedures.</P>
                <P>(b) If the actions included in the EIS are substantially the same as those proposed by NRCS, the RFO is to recirculate the EIS as “final.” The final EIS is to include an appropriate explanation of the action. If these actions are not substantially the same, the EIS is to be supplemented and recirculated as a draft EIS. The RFO is to inform the preparing agency of the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(c) If the adopted EIS is not final, if it is the subject of a referral under 40 CFR part 1504, or if the statement's adequacy is in litigation, the RFO is to include an appropriate explanation in the EIS.</P>
                <P>(d) The RFO is to take appropriate action to inform the public and appropriate agencies of the proposed action.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Environmental documents.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) NRCS is to use the following documents in compliance with NEPA (see § 650.4):</P>
                <P>(1) Environmental assessments (EA)</P>
                <P>(2) Environmental impact statements (EIS)</P>
                <P>(3) Notice of intent (NOI)</P>
                <P>(4) Finding of no significant impact (FNSI)</P>
                <P>(5) Record of decision (ROD)</P>
                <P>(b) The format and content of each document is to be appropriate to the action being considered and consistent with the CEQ regulations.</P>

                <P>(1) To reduce duplication, NRCS may combine environmental documents with other planning documents of the same proposal, as appropriate. For example, NRCS, in consultation with CEQ and the office of the Secretary of Agriculture, has determined that each EIS is to satisfy the requirements for a regulatory impact analysis as required <PRTPAGE P="594"/>by Executive Order 12044. This may necessitate modifying the recommended CEQ format. If documents are combined, the RFO is to include the information and sections required by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10). The environmental impact statement should indicate those considerations, including factors not related to environmental quality, that are likely to be relevant to a decision.</P>
                <P>(2) The RFO is to establish the format and content of each document giving full consideration to the guidance and requirements of the CEQ regulations. The NRCS technical service center director is to provide guidance and concurrence on the format and content if the NRCS state conservationist is the RFO. The results of scoping are to determine the content of the EA or the EIS and the amount of detail needed to analyze the impacts.</P>
                <P>(3) In addition to the minimum requirements of the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10), environmental assessments and environmental impact statements are to include—</P>
                <P>(i) A brief description of public participation activities of agencies, groups, and individuals during the environmental evaluation;</P>
                <P>(ii) A description of the hazard potential of each alternative, including an explanation of the rationale for dam classification and the risk of dam failure from overtopping for other causes;</P>
                <P>(iii) Information identifying any approved regional plans for water resource management in the study area (40 CFR 1506.2(d)) and a statement on whether the proposed project is consistent with such plans;</P>
                <P>(iv) All Federal permits, licenses, and other entitlements that must be obtained (40 CFR 1502.25(b)); and</P>
                <P>(v) A brief description of major environmental problems, conflicts, and disagreements among groups and agencies and how they were resolved. Unresolved conflicts and the NRCS's proposal for resolving the disagreements before the project is implemented are to be summarized.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Letters of comment and responses.</E> (40 CFR 1503.4, 1502.9(b)) Letters of comment that were received and the responses to these comments are to appended to the final EIS. Opposing views and other substantive comments that were not adequately discussed in the draft EIS are to be incorporated in the final EIS.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Appendix.</E> The RFO may use an appendix to an EA or EIS. If an appendix is too voluminous to be circulated with the EIS, the RFO is to make it available on request. If an appendix is included it is to—</P>
                <P>(i) Meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1502.18;</P>
                <P>(ii) Identify any methodologies used (40 CFR 1502.24) and make explicit reference to other sources relied on for conclusions; and</P>

                <P>(iii) Briefly describe the relationship between the benefit-cost analysis and any analyses of unquantified environmental impacts, values, and amenities. “For purposes of complying with the Act, <E T="03">the weighing of the merits or drawbacks of the various alternatives need not be displayed</E> in a monetary cost benefit and should not be when these are important qualitative considerations.” (40 CFR 1502.23).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The purpose of these procedures is to insure that environmental information is provided to decision makers in a timely manner. The NEPA process is a part of NRCS decisionmaking. The RFO is to insure that the policies and purposes of NEPA and CEQ regulations are complied with in NRCS decisionmaking by:</P>
                <P>(1) Including in all decision documents and supporting environmental documents a discussion of all alternatives considered in the decision. Alternatives to be considered in reaching a decision will be available to the public.</P>
                <P>(2) Submitting relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses with other decision documents through the review process.</P>
                <P>(3) Including in the record of formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings relevent environmental documents, comments and responses.</P>

                <P>(4) Providing for pre- and post-project monitoring (40 CFR 1505.2(c), 1505.3) and evaluation in representative projects to insure that planning and evaluation procedures are performed according to sound criteria.<PRTPAGE P="595"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Decision points in NRCS-assisted projects.</E> NRCS administers programs that may have a significant effect on the human environment. Program procedures incorporate provisions for compliance with NEPA and for providing environmental information to the public, other agencies, and decision makers in a timely manner. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for projects under the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention and the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&amp;D) programs. These usually require the preparation of project EA's or EIS's. The major decisionmaking points and their relation to NEPA compliance are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention projects:</P>
                <P>(i) Application for assistance by the sponsoring local organization (SLO).</P>
                <P>(ii) A preauthorization report identifying goals, alternatives, and effects of alternatives (including environmental impacts) prepared by the RFO and submitted to the applicant for decision. It is circulated to local, State, and Federal agencies and public comment is solicited. A decision is made to stop planning assistance or to develop a watershed plan.</P>
                <P>(iii) Granting of planning authorization by the Administrator. The RFO must provide an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts to obtain the authorization.</P>
                <P>(iv) A watershed agreement between the SLO and NRCS. The agreement is based on a completed watershed plan and associated environmental documents, which have been adequately reviewed within NRCS.</P>
                <P>(v) A project agreement between the SLO and the RFO executed after the NEPA process is complete and the watershed plan has been approved and final plans and specifications have been developed.</P>
                <P>(2) For RC&amp;D measure plans:</P>
                <P>(i) A request for assistance (measure proposal) is reviewed by the RC&amp;D council to insure that the proposal is in accordance with the RC&amp;D area plan. The proposal is then referred to NRCS.</P>
                <P>(ii) A preliminary report is prepared by the RFO to identify goals, alternatives, and effects (including environmental impacts). The report is submitted to the sponsor for review. The sponsor may then apply to NRCS for planning assistance for measures considered in the preliminary report.</P>
                <P>(iii) An authorization for planning assistance is granted by the RFO.</P>
                <P>(iv) The RC&amp;D measure plan is signed by the applicant and the RFO after the preparation and review of the measure plan and environmental documents.</P>
                <P>(v) A project agreement is signed between the applicant and the RFO after the NEPA process is complete, the measure plan has been approved, and final plans and specifications have been prepared.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of decision</E> The RFO is to prepare a concise record of decision (ROD) for actions requiring an EIS. The record of decision is to be prepared and signed by the RFO following the 30-day administrative action period initiated by the EPA's publication of the notice of availability of the final EIS in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> It is to serve as the public record of decision as described in 40 CFR 1505.2 of the CEQ regulations. The ROD is to be distributed to all who provided substantive comments on the draft EIS and all others who request it. A notice of availability of the ROD will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and local newspaper(s) serving the project area. The RFO may choose to publish the entire ROD.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental Assessments and Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI)</E>—(1) <E T="03">EA's.</E> If the EA indicates that the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the RFO is to prepare a finding of no significant impact (FNSI).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Availability of the FNSI (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)).</E> In accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2), NRCS shall make the EA/FNSI available for public review for thirty days in the following instances: The proposed action is, or closely similar to, one which normally requires the preparation of an EIS as defined by NRCS NEPA implementing regulations at § 650.7, or the nature of the action is one without precedent. When availability for public review for thirty days <PRTPAGE P="596"/>is not required, NRCS will involve the public in the preparation of the EA/FONSI and make the EA/FONSI available for public review in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1501.4(b) and 1506.6.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Changes in actions.</E> When it appears that a project or other action needs to be changed, the RFO will perform an environmental evaluation of the authorized action to determine whether a supplemental NEPA analysis is necessary before making a change.</P>

                <P>In addition to the requirements of 40 CFR 1503, 1506.10 and 1506.11, NRCS will take the following steps in distributing EIS's for review and comment:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Draft EIS's.</E> Five copies of the draft EIS are to be filed by the RFO with the Office of Environmental Review, A-104, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. At the same time, the RFO is to send copies of the draft EIS to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Other Federal agencies.</E> The regional office of EPA and other agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental effect, other Federal agencies (including appropriate field and regional offices), and affected Indian tribes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">State and local agencies.</E> OMB Circular No. A-95 (Revised), through its system of State and areawide clearinghouses, provides a means for obtaining the views of State and local environmental agencies that can assist in the preparation and review of EIS's</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Organizations, groups, and individuals.</E> A copy of the draft EIS is to be sent to the appropriate official of each organization or group and each individual of the interested public (§ 650.9(d)(3)(i)) and to others as requested. A charge may be made for multiple copy requests.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Time period for comment.</E> The time period for review ends 45 days after the date EPA publishes the notice of public availability of the draft in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> A 15-day-extension of time for review and comment is to be considered by the RFO when such requests are submitted in writing. If neither comments nor a request for an extension is received at the end of the 45-day period, it is to be presumed that the agency or party from whom comments were requested has no comments to make.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">News releases.</E> In addition to the notice of availability published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by EPA, the RFO is to announce the availability of the draft EIS in one or more newspapers serving the area.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Revising a draft EIS.</E> If significant changes in the proposed action are made as a result of comments on the draft EIS, a revised draft EIS may be necessary. The revised draft EIS is to be recirculated for comment in the same manner as a draft EIS.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Final EIS's.</E> After the review period for the draft EIS, the RFO is to prepare a final EIS, making adjustments where necessary by taking into consideration and responding to significant comments and opposing viewpoints received on the draft EIS. The following steps are to be taken in filing and distributing the final EIS:</P>
                <P>(1) Letters of comment are to be appended to the final EIS. If numerous repetitive responses are received, summaries of the repetitive comments and a list of the groups or individuals who commented may be appended in lieu of the actual letter.</P>
                <P>(2) The RFO is to send five copies of the final EIS to EPA's Office of Environmental Review, and a copy of the final EIS to each State and Federal agency, organization, group, and individual who commented on the draft EIS. Single copy requests for copies of the final EIS will be provided without charge. A charge may be made for multiple copy requests.</P>
                <P>(3) During the 30-day administrative action period noted in § 650.12(c), NRCS will make its final EIS available to the public (40 CFR 1506.10).</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Supplements to EIS's.</E> (1) If NRCS determines that it is necessary to clarify or amplify a point of concern raised after the final EIS is filed, appropriate clarification or amplification is to be sent to EPA with information copies furnished to those who received copies of the final EIS.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">NRCS employees assigned to review and comment</E> on EIS's prepared by other agencies are to be familiar with NRCS policies and guidelines contained in this part, and NEPA.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">EIS's received for review by NRCS for which NRCS has expertise or interest</E> shall be responded to promptly. Comments are to be objective with the intent to offer suggestions to help minimize adverse impacts of the proposed action to ensure the health and welfare of the agricultural community. Comments are to be based on knowledge readily available. Field office technical guides, soil surveys, field investigation reports, and other resource data and reference materials developed by NRCS and other agencies should be used and cited. It is not intended that special surveys or investigations be conducted to acquire additional information for use in preparing comments.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">The NRCS reviewer should consider the following kinds of concerns</E>—(1) <E T="03">The suitability or limitations of the soils for the proposed action.</E> Would an alternative route, location, or layout minimize land use problems and adverse environmental impacts?</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Provisions for control of erosion and management of water during construction.</E> Are there resources downstream that would be affected by sediment from the construction area, and does the statement provide for adequate control measures? Will lack of erosion control cause air pollution? Is the stockpiling of topsoil for future use considered in the EIS?</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Provisions for soil and water conservation management measures on project lands, rights-of-way, access roads, and borrow areas.</E> Does the statement indicate that enduring soil and water practices are to be installed and maintained?</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">The effect of water discharges from project lands or rights-of-way onto other properties.</E> Will discharges cause erosion or flooding on other lands? Will discharges affect water quality?</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">The effects of disruption of the natural drainage patterns and severance of private land units.</E> Does the statement indicate that natural drainage patterns will be maintained? Will bridges, culverts, and other water control structures be located to ensure that adjacent lands are not flooded or otherwise restricted in use? Does the EIS describe the effects of severance on private land ownerships?</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">The impact on existing soil and water conservation management systems.</E> To what extent will conservation systems be altered, severed, or suffer blocked outlets? Will land use or cover be affected?</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Impacts on prime and unique farmland.</E> Would an alternative location or route require less prime farmland? Does the EIS consider secondary effects on prime farmland? What benefits are foregone if prime farmland is taken?</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Impacts on ecosystems.</E> Does the EIS describe impacts on major plant communities, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems?</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Impacts on NRCS-assisted projects.</E> Does the statement reflect the effect of the proposed action on present or planned NRCS assisted projects?</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">EIS's referred to NRCS for departmental comments.</E> EIS's referred by the USDA Coordinator for Environmental Quality Activities to the NRCS national office may designate NRCS as <PRTPAGE P="598"/>the lead agency for preparing comments for USDA. In this case, the NRCS national office determines whether inputs from STC's and other USDA agencies are needed. If so, STC's and other USDA agencies are requested to forward comments to the Environmental Services Division fo use in preparing the USDA response.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">EIS's referred to NRCS for agency comments.</E> EIS's received by the NRCS national office are screened by the Director, Environmental Services Division to determine which office within NRCS will prepare comments. If the proposed action is within one State, the draft EIS will be forwarded to the appropriate STC and he will reply directly to the agency requesting the comments. If the proposed action involves more than one State, one STC will be designated to forward NRCS comments directly to the agency requesting the comments. In some cases, the action may be national or regional in scope, and require inputs from several offices within NRCS. In this instance, comments will be assembled in the Environmental Services Division for preparation of a response to the agency requesting comments. A copy of each response prepared by a STC should be sent to the Director, Environmental Services Division.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">EIS's sent to NRCS offices other than the national office.</E> If a STC receives an EIS from another agency, he is to respond to the initiating agency. A copy of his comments should be sent to the Director, Environmental Services Division.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Working relations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related State environmental agencies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> The authorities and missions of NRCS, EPA, and state environmental agencies make it imperative that an effective cooperative and coordinative working relationship be developed and maintained in areas of mutual concern. These common areas include air quality, water quality, pesticides, waste recycling and disposal, environmental considerations in land use, Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) and environmental considerations in the conservation and development of natural resources.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> NRCS will work closely with EPA in accordance with the provisions of the EPA-USDA Memorandum of Understanding July 31, 1974, at all administrative levels and with related state agencies to meet statutory requirements and to achieve harmonious implementation of all actions of mutual concern directed to improving or maintaining the quality of the environment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">NRCS national office.</E> The Deputy Administrator for Field Services is responsible for overall coordination with EPA at the national office level.

                <SUBJECT>Rare, threatened, and endangered species of plants and animals.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> (1) A variety of plant and animal species of the United States are so reduced in numbers that they are threatened with extinction. The disappearance of any of these would be a biological, cultural, and in some instances an economic loss. Their existence contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding, and their presence adds interest and variety to life.</P>
                <P>(2) The principal hazard to threatened and endangered species is the destruction or deterioration of their habitats by human activities such as industrialization, urbanization, agriculture, lumbering, recreation, and transportation. These activities of man will continue but the necessity of recognizing their adverse impacts and selecting alternatives that minimize or eliminate such impacts on threatened and endangered species is imperative.</P>

                <P>(3) The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-205, 87 Stat. 884 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <E T="03">et seq.</E>)) provides a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend may be maintained and a program for the conservation of such species. The Act also provides that, in addition to the Department of the Interior, “All other federal departments and agencies shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary (of Interior), utilize their authorities for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species listed pursuant to section 4 of this Act and by taking such action necessary to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered species and threatened species or result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with the affected states, to be critical.” The Act also:</P>
                <P>(i) Defines endangered species as any species in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and threatened species as any species likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The Act uses the category “threatened.” The term “rare” is not used.</P>

                <P>(ii) Further defines species as including any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants and any other group of fish and <PRTPAGE P="600"/>wildlife of the same species or smaller taxa in common spatial arrangements that interbreed when mature.</P>
                <P>(iii) Provides for the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with states for the purpose of implementing state programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened fish and wildlife. This assistance may include financial grants.</P>

                <P>(iv) Provides national lists of endangered and threatened animal and plant species to be maintained by the Secretary of the Interior and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> When resident fish and wildlife are added to the list, the affected states are to be consulted by the Secretary. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is preparing a list of endangered or threatened plant species.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> The Act gives NRCS additional direction for participation in the conservation and protection of endangered and threatened species. As the principal federal agency concerned with land use planning of privately owned rural land and with professional conservation employees headquartered in almost every county, NRCS is uniquely capable of playing a vital role. Additional training will be provided as needed to meet NRCS responsibilities. NRCS will assist in the conservation of threatened and endangered species and consistent with legal requirements avoid or prevent activities detrimental to such species. NRCS concern for these species will not be limited to those listed by the Secretary of the Interior and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> but will include species designated by state agencies as rare, threatened, endangered, etc.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">NRCS national office.</E> The Administrator will arrange for consultation and coordination of NRCS national office activities with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other federal agencies, and national organizations.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Technical service center.</E> The TSC director will, within the group of states served by the TSC arrange for consultation and coordination with regional representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other Federal agencies, and national and regional organizations.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">NRCS state office.</E> The state conservationist will arrange for consultation and coordination with the state fish and game or conservation agency, other state agencies, state organizations and foundations, conservation districts, and state representatives of federal agencies and national organizations.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordination and implementation.</E> (1) The NRCS national office will:</P>
                <P>(i) Within the framework of national legislation, USDA agreements, and NRCS objectives, develop NRCS policies and directives for guiding agency efforts that will protect threatened and endangered species and for avoiding actions that jeopardize the continued existence of such species and their critical habitats.</P>
                <P>(ii) Maintain needed liaison and develop mutual understanding with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other concerned federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(iii) Establish procedures for periodic review of NRCS participation in the national effort to conserve these species.</P>
                <P>(2) The TSC director will: (i) Within the framework of NRCS policies and guidelines, arrange for needed liaison and understanding with regional counterparts of other federal agencies within the group of states served by the TSC and keep state conservationists informed of developments within such states.</P>
                <P>(ii) Provide guidance and assistance to state conservationists in carrying out NRCS policies and guidelines.</P>
                <P>(3) The state conservationist will develop procedures to establish working relationships with other concerned federal agencies, state fish and wildlife or conservation agencies, conservation districts, concerned scientists in state university systems and natural history museums, and other informed persons and organizations to offer assistance in:</P>
                <P>(i) Preparing or maintaining lists of the state's threatened and endangered species.</P>

                <P>(ii) Determining the geographic occurrence of endangered and threatened species, the nature of their habitat, and that portion of the habitat that is critical to the survival, maintenance, or increase of these species.<PRTPAGE P="601"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii) Discussing the kinds of measures important to preserve their habitat.</P>
                <P>(iv) A monitoring program that would obtain advanced warning of actions or conditions that could further endanger these species, thereby enabling NRCS and others to take appropriate protective action.</P>
                <P>(v) Assisting recovery teams, as appropriate, in preparing species recovery plans of those endangered and threatened species included in Federal lists.</P>
                <P>(4) The state conservationist will also:</P>
                <P>(i) Keep NRCS area and field offices informed of species listed as being threatened or endangered, geographic area in which they are found, and information such as their numbers, preferred habitat, and critical factors.</P>
                <P>(ii) Review the status of threatened and endangered species each December and send a report of the review to the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(5) NRCS district conservationists within the geographic range of threatened and endangered species will examine conservation district programs and NRCS operations to evaluate their effects on these species, and recommend to district officials and the state conservationist any action needed for their protection.</P>
                <P>(6) NRCS field employees within the geographic range of threatened and endangered species will be continually alert to conditions, actions, or trends that may adversely affect the welfare of these species and report adverse situations to the state conservationist.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Natural areas.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> (1) Natural areas are defined as land or water units where natural conditions are maintained insofar as possible. Natural conditions usually result from allowing ordinary physical and biological processes to operate with a minimum of human intervention. Manipulations may be required on natural areas to maintain or restore features that the areas were established to protect.</P>
                <P>(2) Natural areas may be designated areas of Federal, non-Federal government, or privately controlled land. Designation may be formal as provided for under federal regulations for areas of federal land to be administered as natural areas or by foundations or conservation organizations specifically created to acquire and maintain natural areas. Designation may be informal in the case of private landowners who designate a specific area as a natural area and manage it accordingly. Several professional societies concerned with renewable natural resources encourage establishment of natural areas withdrawn from economic uses and recognition of natural areas maintained and managed in economic enterprises.</P>
                <P>(3) Natural areas are established and maintained for a variety of purposes including:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Furthering science and education.</E> Natural areas provide sites for research and outdoor classrooms for study of plant and animal communities in environments with particular ecological conditions.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Monitoring the surrounding environment.</E> Natural areas serve as gauges against which to evaluate changes in land use, vegetation, animal life, air quality, or other environmental values.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Providing recreation attractions.</E> Natural areas are valued by many people for their scenic, wild, and undisturbed character but must be protected, as needed, to prevent disturbance or alteration of the resources.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Preserving unique values.</E> Natural areas may be established to protect scenic, biologic, geologic, or paleontologic features.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Serving as a genetic base for native plants and animals.</E> Natural areas may be established to preserve examples of land and water ecosystems with their full range of genetic diversity of native plants and animals including threatened and endangered species.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> NRCS will recognize natural areas, if so dedicated, as a land use, and will support the designation of appropriate natural areas.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">NRCS national office.</E> The Administrator will designate a member of the national office staff to act as NRCS representative on the Federal Committee for Ecological Preserves and to provide appropriate liaison with other federal agencies and non-Federal groups concerned with natural areas.<PRTPAGE P="602"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Technical service center.</E> The TSC director will designate a TSC plant sciences discipline leader to provide leadership, appropriate liaison, and assistance on natural areas to NRCS state offices.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">NRCS state office.</E> The state conservationist will designate an appropriate NRCS representative to work with other agencies and groups, and will coordinate assistance on natural areas needed by area and field offices.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordination and implementation.</E> (1) NRCS technical assistance will be furnished to representatives of administering agencies, foundations, groups, and individuals when requested through conservation districts. Conservation district officers will be encouraged to recognize appropriate natural areas concepts and programs and to participate in them.</P>
                <P>(2) NRCS employees will report to state conservationists abuses and potential or actual damages to natural areas that may be found in the course of ordinary business.</P>
                <P>(3) NRCS will cooperate with professional societies, groups, and individuals in locating areas suitable for and needed as natural areas.</P>
                <P>(4) NRCS employees providing technical assistance to land users must inform them about the impact their decisions may have on adjacent or nearby natural areas. Land users will be encouraged to consult with concerned agencies, societies, and individuals to arrive at mutually satisfactory land use and treatment.</P>

                <P>(5) Recommended classification systems for characterizing areas designated as ecological preserves or as natural areas are contained in the following publications:

                <SUBJECT>Scenic beauty (visual resource).</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> Contributions to scenic beauty are a normal product of NRCS work. Strip-cropping, field borders, field windbreaks, and ponds are examples. Emphasis is given to those soil and water conservation measures that contribute to a productive and efficient agriculture and increase the attractiveness of rural America and are in line with goals and objectives of conservation districts. This is best accomplished by considering the landscape visual resource when providing planning assistance to individual landowners, groups, units of government, and watershed and resource conservation development project sponsors. NRCS responsibilities in recreation also offer opportunities to develop the scenic beauty of the rural landscape. Department of Agriculture Secretary's Memorandum 1695, May 28, 1970, “Protecting and Improving The Quality of the Environment,” includes scenic beauty as an objective of the Department's programs.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> NRCS will:</P>
                <P>(1) Provide technical assistance with full consideration of alternative management and development systems that preserve scenic beauty or improve the visual resource;</P>

                <SUBJECT>Flood-plain management.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Through proper planning, flood plains can be managed to reduce the threat to human life, health, and property in ways that are environmentally sensitive. Most flood plains are valuable for maintaining agricultural and forest products for food and fiber, fish and wildlife habitat, temporary floodwater storage, park and recreation areas, and for maintaining and improving environmental values. NRCS technical and financial assistance is provided to land users primarily on non-Federal land through local conservation districts and other State and local agencies. Through its programs, NRCS encourages sound flood-plain management decisions by land users.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> NRCS provides leadership and takes action, where practicable, to conserve, preserve, and restore existing natural and beneficial values in base (100-year) flood plains as part of technical and financial assistance in the programs it administers. In addition, 500-year flood plains are taken into account where there are “critical actions” such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, utilities, and facilities producing or storing volatile, toxic, or water-reactive materials.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Technical assistance.</E> NRCS provides leadership, through consultation and advice to conservation districts and land users, in the wise use, conservation, and preservation of all land, including flood plains. Handbooks, manuals, and internal memoranda set forth specific planning criteria for addressing flood-plain management in NRCS-assisted programs. The general <PRTPAGE P="604"/>procedures and guidelines in this part comply with Executive Order (E.O.) 11988, Floodplain Management, dated May 24, 1977, and are consistent with the Water Resources Council's Unified National Program for Floodplain Management.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Compatible land uses.</E> The NRCS Administrator has determined that providing technical and financial assistance for the following land uses is compatible with E.O. 11988:</P>
                <P>(i) Agricultural flood plains that have been used for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, or oilseed for at least 3 of the 5 years before the request for assistance; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Agricultural production in accordance with official State or designated area water-quality plans.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonproject technical and financial assistance programs.</E> The NRCS Administrator has determined that NRCS may not provide technical and financial assistance to land users if the results of such assisted actions are likely to have significant adverse effects on existing natural and beneficial values in the base flood plain and if NRCS determines that there are practicable alternatives outside the base flood plain. NRCS will make a case-by-case decision on whether to limit assistance whenever a land user proposes converting existing agricultural land to a significantly more intensive agricultural use that could have significant adverse effects on the natural and beneficial values or increase flood risk in the base flood plain. NRCS will carefully evaluate the potential extent of the adverse effects and any increased flood risk.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Project technical and financial assistance programs.</E> In planning and installing land and water resource conservation projects, NRCS will avoid to the extent possible the long and short-term adverse effects of the occupancy and modification of base flood plains. In addition, NRCS also will avoid direct or indirect support of development in the base flood plain wherever there is a practicable alternative. As such, the environmental evaluation required for each project action (§ 650.5 of this part) will include alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in base flood plains. Public participation in planning is described in § 650.6 of this part and will comply with section 2(a)(4) of E.O. 11988. Flood-plain management requires the integration of these concerns into NRCS's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for project assistance programs as described in Section 650 of this part.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Real property and facilities under NRCS ownership or control.</E> NRCS owns or controls about 30 properties that are used primarily for the evaluation and development of plant materials for erosion control and fish and wildlife habitat plantings (7 CFR Part 613, Plant Materials Centers, 16 U.S.C. 590 a-e, f, and 7 U.S.C. 1010-1011). If NRCS real properties or facilities are located in the base flood plain, NRCS will require an environmental evaluation when new structures and facilities or major modifications are proposed. If it is determined that the only practicable alternative for siting the proposed action may adversely affect the base flood plain, NRCS will design or modify its action to minimize potential harm to or within the flood plain and will prepare and circulate a notice explaining why the action is proposed to be located in the base flood plain. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) flood insurance maps, other available maps, information, or an onsite analysis will be used to determine whether the proposed NRCS action is in the base flood plain. Public participation in the action will be the same as described in § 650.6 of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibility.</E> NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to land users primarily through conservation districts, special purpose districts, and other State or local subdivisions of State government. Acceptance of this assistance is voluntary on the part of the land user. NRCS does not have authority to make land use decisions on non-Federal land. NRCS provides the land user with technical flood hazard data and information on flood-plain natural values. NRCS informs the land user how alternative land use decisions may affect the aquatic and terrestial ecosystems, human safety, property, and public welfare. Alternatives to flood-plain occupancy, modification, <PRTPAGE P="605"/>and development are discussed onsite with the land user by NRCS.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">NRCS National Office.</E> (§ 600.2 of this part). The NRCS Administrator, state conservationist, and district conservationist are the responsible Federal officials in NRCS for implementing the policies expressed in these rules. Any deviation from these rules must be approved by the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator for Programs has authority to oversee the application of policy in NRCS programs. Oversight assistance to state conservationists for flood-plain management will be provided by the NRCS technical service centers (§ 600.3 of this part).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">NRCS state offices.</E> (§ 600.4 of this part). Each state conservationist is the responsible Federal official in all NRCS-assisted programs administered within the State. He or she is also responsible for administering the plant materials centers within the State. The state conservationist will assign a staff person who has basic knowledge of landforms, soils, water, and related plant and animal ecosystems to provide technical oversight to ensure that assistance to land users and project sponsors on the wise use, conservation, and preservation of flood plains is compatible with national policy. For NRCS-assisted project actions, the staff person assigned by the state conservationist will consult with the local jurisdictions, sponsoring local organizations, and land users, on the basis of an environmental evaluation, to determine what constitutes significant adverse effects or incompatible development in the base flood plain. The state conservationist is to prepare and circulate a written notice for NRCS-assisted actions for which the only practicable alternative requires siting in a base flood plain and may result in adverse effects or incompatible development. The NRCS NEPA process will be used to integrate flood-plain management into project planning and consultations on land use decisions by land users and project sponsors.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">NRCS field offices.</E> The district conservationist (§ 600.6 of this part) is delegated the responsibility for providing technical assistance and approving financial assistance to land users in nonproject actions, where applicable, and for deciding what constitutes an adverse effect or incompatible development of a base flood plain. This assistance will be based on official NRCS policy, rules, guidelines, and procedures in NRCS handbooks, manuals, memoranda, etc. For NRCS-assisted nonproject actions, the district conservationist, on the basis of the environmental evaluation, will advise recipients of technical and financial assistance about what constitutes a significant adverse effect or incompatible development in the base flood plain.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Coordination and implementation.</E> All planning by NRCS staffs is interdisciplinary and encompasses the six NEPA policy statements, the WRC Principles and Standards, and an equivalent of the eight-step decisionmaking process in the WRC's February 1978 Floodplain Management Guidelines. NRCS internal handbooks, manuals, and memoranda provide detailed information and guidance for NRCS planning and environmental evaluation.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Steps for nonproject technical and financial assistance programs.</E> (i) NRCS assistance programs are voluntary and are carried out through local conservation districts (State entities) primarily on non-Federal, privately owned lands.</P>
                <P>(ii) After the land user decides the type, extent, and location of the intended action for which assistance is sought, the district conservationist will determine if the intended action is in the base flood plain by using HUD flood insurance maps, and other available maps and information or by making an onsite determination of the approximate level of the 100-year flood if maps or other usable information are lacking.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the district conservationist determines that the land user's proposed location is outside the base flood plain, and would not cause potential harm within the base flood plain, NRCS will continue to provide assistance, as needed.</P>

                <P>(iv) If the district conservationist determines that the land user's proposed action is within the base flood plain and would likely result in adverse effects, incompatible development, or an <PRTPAGE P="606"/>increased flood hazard, it is the responsibility of the district conservationist to determine and point out to the land user alternative methods of achieving the objective, as well as alternative locations outside the base flood plain. If the alternative locations are determined to be impractical, the district conservationist will decide whether to continue providing assistance. If the decision is to terminate assistance for the proposed action, the land user and the local conservation district, if one exists, will be notified in writing about the decision.</P>
                <P>(v) If the district conservationist decides to continue providing technical and financial assistance for a proposed action in the base flood plain, which is the only practicable alternative, NRCS may require that the proposed action be designed or modified so as to minimize potential harm to or within the flood plain. The district conservationist will prepare and circulate locally a written notice explaining why the action is proposed to be located in the base flood plain.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Steps for project assistance programs.</E> (i) NRCS project assistance to local sponsoring organizations (conservation districts and other legal entities of State government) and land users is carried out primarily on non-Federal land in response to requests for assistance. NRCS helps the local sponsoring organizations prepare a plan for implementing the needed resource measures.</P>
                <P>(ii) NRCS uses an interdisciplinary environmental evaluation (§ 650.6 of this part) as a basis for providing recommendations and alternatives to project sponsors. Flood-plain management is an integral part of every NRCS environmental evaluation. NRCS delineates the base flood plain by using detailed HUD flood insurance maps and other available data, as appropriate, and provides recommendations to sponsors on alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in base flood plains. NRCS will develop, as needed, detailed 100-year and 500-year flood-plain maps where there are none.</P>
                <P>(iii) NRCS's NEPA process (part 650 of this chapter) is used to integrate the spirit and intent of E.O. 11988 Sections 2(a) and 2(c) into agency planning and recommendations for land and water use decisions by local sponsoring organizations and land users.</P>
                <P>(iv) NRCS will terminate assistance to a local sponsoring organization in project programs if it becomes apparent that decisions by land users and local jurisdictions concerning flood-plain management would likely result in adverse effects or incompatible development and the environmental evaluation reveals that there are practicable alternatives to the proposed project that would not cause adverse effects on the base flood plain.</P>
                <P>(v) In carrying out the planning and installation of land and water resource conservation projects, NRCS will avoid, to the extent possible, the long-term and short-term adverse effects associated with the occupancy and modification of base flood plains. In addition, NRCS will also avoid direct or indirect support of development in the base flood plain wherever there is a practicable alternative. Where appropriate, NRCS will require design modifications to minimize harm to or within the base flood plain. NRCS will provide appropriate public notice and public participation in the continuing planning process in accordance with NRCS NEPA process.</P>
                <P>(vi) NRCS may require the local government to adopt and enforce appropriate flood plain regulations as a condition to receiving project financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Actions on property and facilities under NRCS ownership or control.</E> For real property and facilities owned by or under the control of NRCS, the following actions will be taken:</P>
                <P>(i) Locate new structures, facilities, etc., outside the base flood plain if there is a practicable alternate site.</P>
                <P>(ii) Require public participation in decisions to construct structures, facilities, etc., in flood plains that might result in adverse effects and incompatible development in such areas if no practicable alternatives exist.</P>

                <P>(iii) New construction or rehabilitation will be in accordance with the standards and criteria of the National <PRTPAGE P="607"/>Flood Insurance Program and will include floodproofing and other flood protection measures as appropriate.</P>

                <P>(a) The regulations in this part set forth the policies, procedures, and requirements related to delivery of technical assistance by individuals and entities other than the Department, hereinafter referred to as technical service providers (TSPs). The Food Security Act of 1985, requires the Secretary to deliver technical assistance to eligible participants for implementation of its Title XII Programs and the conservation activities in the Agricultural Management Assistance Program, 7 U.S.C. 1524, directly, through an agreement with a third party provider, or at the option of the producer through payment to the producer for an approved third party provider. This regulation defines how a participant acquires technical service from a third party TSP, sets forth a certification and decertification process, and establishes a method to make payments for technical services.</P>
                <P>(b) TSPs may provide technical services to eligible participants in conservation planning, education and outreach, and assistance with design and implementation of conservation practices applied on private land, Indian land, or where allowed by conservation program rules on public land.</P>
                <P>(c) The Chief may implement this part in any of the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianna Islands.</P>

                <P>(a) The Department will not make payment under a program contract for the technical services of a decertified technical service provider that were <PRTPAGE P="618"/>provided during the period of decertification. Likewise, NRCS will not procure, or otherwise enter into an agreement for, the services of a decertified technical service provider during the period of decertification.</P>
                <P>(b) National decertification list. NRCS shall maintain a current list of decertified technical service providers. NRCS shall remove decertified providers from the list of certified providers. Participants may not hire a decertified technical service provider. It is the participant's responsibility to check the decertified list before hiring a technical service provider. Decertification of a technical service provider in one State decertifies the technical service provider from providing technical services under current programs in all States, the Caribbean Area, and the Pacific Basin Area.</P>

                <P>(a) On non-Federal land, sponsor(s) are responsible for financing and performing without cost to the Federal Government, needed operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of project measures installed with Federal financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(b) The Federal agency administering Federal land involving project measures is responsible either for performing or requiring the performance of O&amp;M on land administered by that agency. If project measures benefit both Federal and non-Federal land or interests, the O&amp;M may be performed by the Federal agency, the sponsor(s), or both as mutually agreed by the Federal agency, sponsor(s), and NRCS. If O&amp;M of project measures is performed by mutual agreement, the cost of O&amp;M may be shared by the Federal agency and sponsor(s) as agreed.</P>

                <P>(a) Sponsor(s)' responsibility for O&amp;M of a completed project measure begins when a part of all of the contract installing such measure is completed and accepted from the contractor. If the installation of the project measure is performed by force account, division of work, or performance of work methods, the sponsor(s)' O&amp;M responsibilities begin on the date the work or portion thereof is completed as determined by NRCS, except for completed work located on Federal lands which are subject to special-use permits. The O&amp;M agreement shall specify that O&amp;M will continue through: (1) The evaluated life of the project, or (2) the evaluated life of measures that are economically evaluated as a unit, or (3) the useful life of cost-shared measures that are for land conservation or land utilization. The sponsor(s)' duties and liabilities for the measures under other Federal and State laws are not affected by the expiration of the O&amp;M agreement.</P>

                <P>(b) For project measures being installed in segments, the sponsor(s) <PRTPAGE P="621"/>shall be responsible for O&amp;M of completed and accepted segments. However, the NRCS may share in the cost of repairing damages to a completed segment when the damage is attributed to the continuation of work on uncompleted segments of the measure or when due to the fact that the measure was only partially completed.</P>

For structural measures, inspections are to be made at least annually and after each major storm or occurrence of any unusual condition that might adversely affect the project measures. At the discretion of the State Conservationist, NRCS may assist sponsor(s) with their inspections. NRCS or land-administering agencies may make independent inspections at any time during the period covered by the O&amp;M agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) Sponsor(s) are to maintain a written record of each inspection and furnish NRCS and land-administering agencies a copy of that record. The record should indentify items inspected, O&amp;M work that may be needed, a time frame to do the work, and the date of the inspection. The NRCS and land-administering agencies will provide the sponsor(s) a copy of a similar record of independent inspections.</P>
                <P>(c) The sponsor(s) shall perform the O&amp;M work listed as needed in the inspection reports within the time frame established for each item of work. Failure to perform O&amp;M work will be considered a violation of the O&amp;M agreement and will be handled in accordance with § 654.20.</P>

                <P>(d) Sponsor(s) are to maintain a written record of work performed which is listed in the inspection report and a <PRTPAGE P="622"/>record of other significant O&amp;M activity. The record will identify the measure, item of work, cost of performance, and date completed.</P>
                <P>(e) Sponsor(s)' records relative to the project shall be made available to NRCS for examination.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>NRCS is concerned about any action that tends to impair the productive capacity of American agriculture. The Nation needs to know the extent and location of the best land for producing food, feed, fiber forage, and oilseed crops. In addition to prime and unique farmlands, farmlands that are of statewide and local importance for producing these crops also need to be identified.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
                <P>It is NRCS policy to make and keep current an inventory of the prime farmland and unique farmland of the Nation. This inventory is to be carried out in cooperation with other interested agencies at the National, State, and local levels of government. The objective of the inventory is to identify the extent and location of important rural lands needed to produce food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">State Conservationist.</E> Each NRCS State Conservationist is to:</P>
                <P>(1) Provide leadership for inventories of important farmlands for the State, county, or other subdivision of the State. Each is to work with appropriate agencies of State government and others to establish priorities for making these inventories.</P>
                <P>(2) Identify the soil mapping units within the State that qualify as prime. In doing this, State Conservationists, in consultation with the cooperators of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, have the flexibility to make local deviation from the permeability criterion or to be more restrictive for other specific criteria in order to assure the most accurate identification of prime farmlands for a State. Each is to invite representatives of the Governor's office, agencies of the State government, and others to identify farmlands of statewide importance and unique farmlands that are to be inventoried within the framework of this memorandum.</P>
                <P>(3) Prepare a statewide list of:</P>
                <P>(i) Soil mapping units that meet the criteria for prime farmland;</P>

                <P>(ii) Soil mapping units that are farmlands of statewide importance if the <PRTPAGE P="625"/>criteria used were based on soil information; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Specific high-value food and fiber crops that are grown and, when combined with other favorable factors, qualify lands to meet the criteria for unique farmlands. Copies are to be furnished to NRCS Field Offices and to National Soil Survey Center. (see 7 CFR 600.2(c), 600.6)</P>
                <P>(4) Coordinate soil mapping units that qualify as prime farmlands with adjacent States, including Major Land Resource Area Offices (see 7 CFR 600.4, 600.7) responsible for the soil series. Since farmlands of statewide importance and unique farmlands are designated by others at the State level, the soil mapping units and areas identified need not be coordinated among States.</P>
                <P>(5) Instruct NRCS District Conservationists to arrange local review of lands identified as prime, unique, and additional farmlands of statewide importance by Conservation Districts and representatives of local agencies. This review is to determine if additional farmland should be identified to meet local decisionmaking needs.</P>
                <P>(6) Make and publish each important farmland inventory on a base map of national map accuracy at an intermediate scale of 1:50,000 or 1:100,000. State Conservationists who need base maps of other scales are to submit their requests with justification to the Chief for consideration.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">National Soil Survey Center.</E> The National Soil Survey Center is to provide requested technical assistance to State Conservationists and Major Land Resource Area Offices in inventorying prime and unique farmlands (see 7 CFR 600.2(c)(1), 600.4, 600.7). This includes reviewing statewide lists of soil mapping units that meet the criteria for prime farmlands and resolving coordination problems that may occur among States for specific soil series or soil mapping units.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">National Office.</E> The Deputy Chief for Soil Survey and Resource Assessment (see 7 CFR 600.2(b)(3)) is to provide national leadership in preparing guidelines for inventorying prime farmlands and for national statistics and reports of prime farmlands.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Identification of important farmlands.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Prime farmlands</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops, and is also available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pastureland, rangeland, forest land, or other land, but not urban built-up land or water). It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed, including water management, according to acceptable farming methods. In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils that qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0 to 7 percent slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay loam, 0 to 5 percent slopes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific criteria.</E> Prime farmlands meet all the following criteria: Terms used in this section are defined in USDA publications: “Soil Taxonomy, Agriculture Handbook 436”; “Soil Survey Manual, Agriculture Handbook 18”; “Rainfall-erosion Losses From Cropland, Agriculture Handbook 282”; “Wind Erosion Forces in the United States and Their Use in Predicting Soil Loss, Agriculture Handbook 346”; and “Saline and Alkali Soils, Agriculture Handbook 60.”</P>
                <P>(i) The soils have:</P>

                <P>(A) Aquic, udic, ustic, or xeric moisture regimes and sufficient available water capacity within a depth of 40 inches (1 meter), or in the root zone (root zone is the part of the soil that is penetrated or can be penetrated by <PRTPAGE P="626"/>plant roots) if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep, to produce the commonly grown cultivated crops (cultivated crops include, but are not limited to, grain, forage, fiber, oilseed, sugar beets, sugarcane, vegetables, tobacco, orchard, vineyard, and bush fruit crops) adapted to the region in 7 or more years out of 10; or</P>
                <P>(B) Xeric or ustic moisture regimes in which the available water capacity is limited, but the area has a developed irrigation water supply that is dependable (a dependable water supply is one in which enough water is available for irrigation in 8 out of 10 years for the crops commonly grown) and of adequate quality; or,</P>
                <P>(C) Aridic or torric moisture regimes and the area has a developed irrigation water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality; and,</P>
                <P>(ii) The soils have a temperature regime that is frigid, mesic, thermic, or hyperthermic (pergelic and cryic regimes are excluded). These are soils that, at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm), have a mean annual temperature higher than 32 °F (0 °C). In addition, the mean summer temperature at this depth in soils with an O horizon is higher than 47 °F (8 °C); in soils that have no O horizon, the mean summer temperature is higher than 59 °F (15 °C); and,</P>
                <P>(iii) The soils have a pH between 4.5 and 8.4 in all horizons within a depth of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep; and,</P>
                <P>(iv) The soils either have no water table or have a water table that is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow cultivated crops common to the area to be grown; and,</P>
                <P>(v) The soils can be managed so that, in all horizons within a depth of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep, during part of each year the conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 4 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) is less than 15; and,</P>
                <P>(vi) The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season (less often than once in 2 years); and,</P>
                <P>(vii) The product of K (erodibility factor) × percent slope is less than 2.0, and the product of I (soils erodibility) × C (climatic factor) does not exceed 60; and</P>
                <P>(viii) The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch (0.15 cm) per hour in the upper 20 inches (50 cm) and the mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm) is less than 59 °F (15 °C); the permeability rate is not a limiting factor if the mean annual soil temperature is 59 °F (15 °C) or higher; and,</P>
                <P>(ix) Less than 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches (7.6 cm).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Unique farmland</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Unique farmland is land other than prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high value food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, fruit, and vegetables.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific characteristics of unique farmland.</E> (i) Is used for a specific high-value food or fiber crop; (ii) Has a moisture supply that is adequate for the specific crop; the supply is from stored moisture, precipitation, or a developed-irrigation system; (iii) Combines favorable factors of soil quality, growing season, temperature, humidity, air drainage, elevation, aspect, or other conditions, such a nearness to market, that favor the growth of a specific food or fiber crop.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional farmland of statewide importance.</E> This is land, in addition to prime and unique farmlands, that is of statewide importance for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oil seed crops. Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated and <PRTPAGE P="627"/>managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some States, additonal farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional farmland of local importance.</E> In some local areas there is concern for certain additional farmlands for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops, even though these lands are not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where appropriate, these lands are to be identified by the local agency or agencies concerned. In places, additional farmlands of local importance may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by local ordinance.</P>

As required by section 1541(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202(b), Federal agencies are (a) to use the criteria to identify and take into account the adverse effects of their programs on the preservation of farmland, (b) to consider alternative actions, as appropriate, that could lessen adverse effects, and (c) to ensure that their programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with State and units of local government and private programs and policies to protect farmland. Guidelines to assist agencies in using the criteria are included in this part. The Department of Agriculture (hereinafter USDA) may make available to States, units of local government, individuals, organizations, and other units of the Federal Government, information useful in restoring, maintaining, and improving the quantity and quality of farmland.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Farmland</E> means prime or unique farmlands as defined in section 1540(c)(1) of the Act or farmland that is determined by the appropriate state or unit of local government agency or agencies with concurrence of the Secretary to be farmland of statewide of local importance. “Farmland” does not include land already in or committed to urban development or water storage. Farmland “already in” urban development or water storage includes all such land with a density of 30 structures per 40-acre area. Farmland already in urban development also includes lands identified as “urbanized area” (UA) on the Census Bureau Map, or as urban area mapped with a “tint overprint” on the USGS topographical maps, or as “urban-built-up” on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not “farmland” and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. Farmland “committed to urban development or water storage” includes all such land that receives a combined score of 160 points or less from the land evaluation and site assessment criteria.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal agency</E> means a department, agency, independent commission, or other unit of the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal program</E> means those activities or responsibilities of a Federal agency that involve undertaking, financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects or acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities.</P>
              <P>(1) The term “Federal program” does not include:</P>
              <P>(i) Federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs for activities on private or non-Federal lands; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Construction or improvement projects that were beyond the planning <PRTPAGE P="628"/>stage and were in either the active design or construction state on August 4, 1984.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a project is considered to be “beyond the planning stage and in either the active design or construction state on August 4, 1984” if, on or before that date, actual construction of the project had commenced or:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability and exemptions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Section 1540(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4201(b), states that the purpose of the Act is to minimize the extent to which Federal programs contribute to the unnecessary and irreversible conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. Conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses does not include the construction of on-farm structures necessary for farm operations. Federal <PRTPAGE P="629"/>agencies can obtain assistance from USDA in determining whether a proposed location or site meets the Act's definition of farmland. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) field office serving the area will provide the assistance. Many State or local government planning offices can also provide this assistance.</P>
              <P>(b) Acquisition or use of farmland by a Federal agency for national defense purposes is exempted by section 1547(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4208(b).</P>
              <P>(c) The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or non-Federal land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. In cases where either a private party or a non-Federal unit of government applies for Federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural use, the Federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse effects on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the landowners want to proceed with conversion, the Federal agency, on the basis of the analysis set forth in § 658.4 and any agency policies or procedures for implementing the Act, may provide or deny the requested assistance. Only assistance and actions that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses are subject to this Act. Assistance and actions related to the purchase, maintenance, renovation, or replacement of existing structures and sites converted prior to the time of an application for assistance from a Federal agency, including assistance and actions related to the construction of minor new ancillary structures (such as garages or sheds), are not subject to the Act.</P>
              <P>(d) Section 1548 of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 4209, states that the Act shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any action, either legal or equitable, by any person or class of persons challenging a Federal project, program, or other activity that may affect farmland. Neither the Act nor this rule, therefore, shall afford any basis for such an action. However, as further provided in section 1548, the governor of an affected state, where a state policy or program exists to protect farmland, may bring an action in the Federal district court of the district where a Federal program is proposed to enforce the requirements of section 1541 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202, and regulations issued pursuant to that section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Guidelines for use of criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As stated above and as provided in the Act, each Federal agency shall use the criteria provided in § 658.5 to identify and take into account the adverse effects of Federal programs on the protection of farmland. The agencies are to consider alternative actions, as appropriate, that could lessen such adverse effects, and assure that such Federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with State, unit of local government and private programs and policies to protect farmland. The following are guidelines to assist the agencies in these tasks:</P>

              <P>(a) An agency may determine whether or not a site is farmland as defined in § 658.2(a) or the agency may request that NRCS make such a determination. If an agency elects not to make its own determination, it should make a request to NRCS on Form AD-1006, the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, available at NRCS offices, for determination of whether the site is farmland subject to the Act. If neither the entire site nor any part of it are subject to the Act, then the Act will not apply and NRCS will so notify the agency. If the site is determined by NRCS to be subject to the Act, then NRCS will measure the relative value of the site as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the information sources listed in § 658.5(a). NRCS will respond to these requests within 10 working days of their receipt except that in cases where a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, NRCS will respond in 30 working days. In the event that NRCS fails to complete its response within the required period, if further delay would interfere with construction activities, the agency should proceed as though the site were not farmland.<PRTPAGE P="630"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Form AD 1006, returned to the agency by NRCS will also include the following incidental information: The total amount of farmable land (the land in the unit of local government's jurisdiction that is capable of producing the commonly grown crop); the percentage of the jurisdiction that is farmland covered by the Act; the percentage of farmland in the jurisdiction that the project would convert; and the percentage of farmland in the local government's jurisdiction with the same or higher relative value than the land that the project would convert. These statistics will not be part of the criteria scoring process, but are intended simply to furnish additional background information to Federal agencies to aid them in considering the effects of their projects on farmland.</P>
              <P>(c) After the agency receives from NRCS the score of a site's relative value as described in § 658.4(a) and then applies the site assessment criteria which are set forth in § 658.5 (b) and (c), the agency will assign to the site a combined score of up to 260 points, composed of up to 100 points for relative value and up to 160 points for the site assessment. With this score the agency will be able to identify the effect of its programs on farmland, and make a determination as to the suitability of the site for protection as farmland. Once this score is computed, USDA recommends:</P>
              <P>(1) Sites with the highest combined scores be regarded as most suitable for protection under these criteria and sites with the lowest scores, as least suitable.</P>
              <P>(2) Sites receiving a total score of less than 160 need not be given further consideration for protection and no additional sites need to be evaluated.</P>
              <P>(3) Sites receiving scores totaling 160 or more be given increasingly higher levels of consideration for protection.</P>
              <P>(4) When making decisions on proposed actions for sites receiving scores totaling 160 or more, agency personnel consider:</P>
              <P>(i) Use of land that is not farmland or use of existing structures;</P>
              <P>(ii) Alternative sites, locations and designs that would serve the proposed purpose but convert either fewer acres of farmland or other farmland that has a lower relative value;</P>
              <P>(iii) Special siting requirements of the proposed project and the extent to which an alternative site fails to satisfy the special siting requirements as well as the originally selected site.</P>
              <P>(d) Federal agencies may elect to assign the site assessment criteria relative weightings other than those shown in § 658.5 (b) and (c). If an agency elects to do so, USDA recommends that the agency adopt its alternative weighting system (1) through rulemaking in consultation with USDA, and (2) as a system to be used uniformly throughout the agency. USDA recommends that the weightings stated in § 658.5 (b) and (c) be used until an agency issues a final rule to change the weightings.</P>
              <P>(e) It is advisable that evaluations and analyses of prospective farmland conversion impacts be made early in the planning process before a site or design is selected, and that, where possible, agencies make the FPPA evaluations part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Under the agency's own NEPA regulations, some categories of projects may be excluded from NEPA which may still be covered under the FPPA. Section 1540(c)(4) of the Act exempts projects that were beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design or construction state on the effective date of the Act. Section 1547(b) exempts acquisition or use of farmland for national defense purposes. There are no other exemptions of projects by category in the Act.</P>

              <P>(f) Numerous States and units of local government are developing and adopting Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) systems to evaluate the productivity of agricultural land and its suitability for conversion to nonagricultural use. Therefore, States and units of local government may have already performed an evaluation using criteria similar to those contained in this rule applicable to Federal agencies. USDA recommends that where sites are to be evaluated within a jurisdiction having a State or local LESA system that has been approved by the governing body of such jurisdiction and has been placed on the NRCS <PRTPAGE P="631"/>State conservationist's list as one which meets the purpose of the FPPA in balance with other public policy objectives, Federal agencies use that system to make the evaluation.</P>
              <P>(g) To meet reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4207, and for data collection purposes, after the agency has made a final decision on a project in which one or more of the alternative sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, the agency is requested to return a copy of the Form AD-1006, which indicates the final decision of the agency, to the NRCS field office.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA for the conversion of a site, that agency's, or a second Federal agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions on the same site do not require additional redundant FPPA analysis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section states the criteria required by section 1541(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202(a). The criteria were developed by the Secretary of Agriculture in cooperation with other Federal agencies. They are in two parts, (1) the land evaluation criterion, relative value, for which NRCS will provide the rating or score, and (2) the site assessment criteria, for which each Federal agency must develop its own ratings or scores. The criteria are as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Land Evaluation Criterion—Relative Value.</E> The land evaluation criterion is based on information from several sources including national cooperative soil surveys or other acceptable soil surveys, NRCS field office technical guides, soil potential ratings or soil productivity ratings, land capability classifications, and important farmland determinations. Based on this information, groups of soils within a local government's jurisdiction will be evaluated and assigned a score between 0 to 100, representing the relative value, for agricultural production, of the farmland to be converted by the project compared to other farmland in the same local government jurisdiction, This score will be the Relative Value Rating on Form AD 1006.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Site Assessment Criteria.</E> Federal agencies are to use the following criteria to assess the suitability of each proposed site or design alternative for protection as farmland along with the score from the land evaluation criterion described in § 658.5(a). Each criterion will be given a score on a scale of 0 to the maximum points shown. Conditions suggesting top, intermediate and bottom scores are indicated for each criterion. The agency would make scoring decisions in the context of each proposed site or alternative action by examining the site, the surrounding area, and the programs and policies of the State or local unit of government in which the site is located. Where one given location has more than one design alternative, each design should be considered as an alternative site. The site assessment criteria are:</P>

              <P>(a) Section 1542(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203, states, “Each department, agency, independent commission or other unit of the Federal Government, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, shall review current provisions of law, administrative rules and regulations, and policies and procedures applicable to it to determine whether any provision thereof will prevent such unit of the Federal Government from taking appropriate action to comply fully with the provisions of this subtitle.”</P>
              <P>(b) Section 1542(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203, requires, as appropriate, each department, agency, independent commission, or other unit of the Federal Government, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, to develop proposals for action to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the purpose and policy of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) USDA will provide certain assistance to other Federal agencies for the purposes specified in section 1542 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203. If a Federal agency identifies or suggests changes in laws, administrative rules and regulations, policies, or procedures that may affect the agency's compliance with the Act, USDA can advise the agency of the probable effects of the changes on the protection of farmland. To request this assistance, officials of Federal agencies should correspond with the Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013.</P>
              <P>(d) To meet the reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4207, and for data collection purposes, each Federal agency is requested to report to the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service by November 15th of each year on progress made during the prior fiscal year to implement sections 1542 (a) and (b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203 (a) and (b). Until an agency fully implements those sections, the agency should continue to make the annual report, but may omit the report upon full implementation. However, an agency is requested to file an annual report for any future year in which the agency has substantially changed its process for compliance with the Act.</P>
