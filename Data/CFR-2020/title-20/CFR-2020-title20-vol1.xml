      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(a) The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment Standards, by authority vested in him by the Secretary of Labor in Secretary's Order No. 13-71 (36 FR 8755), established in the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) an Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) by Employment Standards Order No. 2-74 (39 FR 34722).

            <SUBJECT>When was the former Bureau of Employees' Compensation abolished?</SUBJECT>
            <P>By Secretary of Labor's Order issued September 23, 1974 (39 FR 34723), issued concurrently with Employment Standards Order 2-74 (39 FR 34722), the Secretary revoked the prior Secretary's Order No. 18-67 (32 FR 12979), which had delegated authority and assigned responsibility for the various workers' compensation programs enumerated in § 1.2, except the Black Lung Benefits Program and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program not then in existence, to the Director of the former Bureau of Employees' Compensation.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How were many of OWCP's current functions administered in the past?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Administration of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was initially vested in an independent establishment known as the U.S. Employees' Compensation Commission. By Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1946 (3 CFR, 1943-1949 Comp., p. 1064; 60 Stat. 1095, effective July 16, 1946), the Commission was abolished and its functions were transferred to the Federal Security Agency to be performed by a newly created Bureau of Employees' Compensation within such Agency. By Reorganization Plan No. 19 of 1950 (15 FR 3178, 3 CFR, 1949-1954 Comp., page 1010, 64 Stat. 1271), said Bureau was transferred to the Department of Labor (DOL), and the authority formerly vested in the Administrator, Federal Security Agency, was vested in the Secretary of Labor. By Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1950 (15 FR 3174, 3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., page 1004, 64 Stat. 1263), the Secretary of Labor was authorized to make from time to time such provisions as he shall deem appropriate, authorizing the performance of any of his functions by any other officer, agency, or employee of the DOL.</P>
            <P>(b) In 1972, two separate organizational units were established within the Bureau: an Office of Workmen's Compensation Programs (37 FR 20533) and an Office of Federal Employees' Compensation (37 FR 22979). In 1974, these two units were abolished and one organizational unit, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, was established in lieu of the Bureau of Employees' Compensation (39 FR 34722).</P>

This system of records is maintained by and under the control of OWCP, and, as such, all records covered by DOL/GOVT-1 are official records of OWCP. The protection, release, inspection and copying of records covered by DOL/GOVT-1 shall be accomplished in accordance with the rules, guidelines and provisions of this part, as well as those contained in 29 CFR parts 70 and 71, and with the notice of the system of records and routine uses published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> All questions relating to access/disclosure, and/or amendment of FECA records maintained by OWCP or the employing agency, are to be resolved in accordance with this section.</P>

                <P>(a) A claimant seeking copies of his or her official FECA file should address a request to the District Director of the OWCP office having custody of the file. A claimant seeking copies of FECA-related documents in the custody of the employer should follow the procedures established by that agency.</P>
                <P>(b) (1) While an employing agency may establish procedures that an injured employee or beneficiary should follow in requesting access to documents it maintains, any decision issued in response to such a request must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Labor which govern all other aspects of safeguarding these records.</P>

                <P>(2) No employing agency has the authority to issue determinations with respect to requests for the correction <PRTPAGE P="18"/>or amendment of records contained in or covered by DOL/GOVT-1.

                <P>(a) A number of statutory provisions make it a crime to file a false or fraudulent claim or statement with the Government in connection with a claim under the FECA, or to wrongfully impede a FECA claim. Included among these provisions are 18 U.S.C. 287, 1001, 1920, and 1922. Furthermore, a civil action to recover benefits paid erroneously under the FECA may be maintained under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733.

                <P>When a beneficiary either pleads guilty to or is found guilty on either Federal or State criminal charges of defrauding the Federal Government in connection with a claim for benefits, the beneficiary's entitlement to any further compensation benefits will terminate effective the date of conviction, which is the date of the verdict or, in the case of a plea bargain, the date the claimant made the plea in open court (not the date of sentencing or the date court papers were signed). The employing agency may, upon request, be required to provide the documentation needed for termination under this section. Termination of entitlement under this section is not affected by any subsequent change in or recurrence of the beneficiary's medical condition.</P>

                <P>(a) Whenever a beneficiary is incarcerated in a State or Federal jail, prison, penal institution or other correctional facility due to a State or Federal felony conviction, he or she forfeits all rights to compensation benefits during the period of incarceration. A beneficiary's right to compensation benefits for the period of his or her incarceration is not restored after such incarceration ends, even though payment of compensation benefits may resume. A beneficiary has an affirmative duty to provide notice of any conviction and imprisonment. The employing agency shall provide OWCP any information or documentation they may have concerning such matters.<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) If the beneficiary has eligible dependents, OWCP will pay compensation to such dependents at a reduced rate during the period of his or her incarceration, by applying the percentages of 5 U.S.C. 8133(a)(1) through (5) to the beneficiary's gross current entitlement rather than to the beneficiary's monthly pay.</P>
                <P>(c) If OWCP's decision on entitlement is pending when the period of incarceration begins, and compensation is due for a period of time prior to such incarceration, payment for that period will only be made to the beneficiary following his or her release.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How and when is a notice of traumatic injury filed?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) To claim benefits under the FECA, an employee who sustains a work-related traumatic injury must give notice of the injury in writing on Form CA-1, which may be obtained from the employer or from the Internet at <E T="03">www.dol.gov</E> under forms. The employee must forward this notice to the employer. Another person, including the employer, may give notice of injury on the employee's behalf. The person submitting a notice shall include the Social Security Number (SSN) of the injured employee. All such notices should be submitted electronically wherever feasible to facilitate processing of such claims. All employers that currently do not have such capability should create such a method by December 31, 2012.</P>
                <P>(b) For injuries sustained on or after September 7, 1974, a notice of injury must be filed within three years of the injury. (The form contains the necessary words of claim.) The requirements for filing notice are further described in 5 U.S.C. 8119. Also see § 10.205 concerning time requirements for filing claims for continuation of pay.</P>
                <P>(1) If the claim is not filed within three years, compensation may still be allowed if notice of injury was given within 30 days or the employer had actual knowledge of the injury or death within 30 days after occurrence. This knowledge may consist of written records or verbal notification. An entry into an employee's medical record may also satisfy this requirement if it is sufficient to place the employer on notice of a possible work-related injury or disease.</P>
                <P>(2) OWCP may excuse failure to comply with the three-year time requirement because of truly exceptional circumstances (for example, being held prisoner of war).</P>
                <P>(3) The claimant may withdraw his or her claim (but not the notice of injury) by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any time before OWCP determines eligibility for benefits. Any continuation of pay (COP) granted to an employee after a claim is withdrawn must be charged to sick or annual leave, or considered an overpayment of pay consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5584, at the employee's option.</P>
                <P>(c) However, in cases of latent disability, the time for filing claim does not begin to run until the employee has a compensable disability and is aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the causal relationship between the disability and the employment (see 5 U.S.C. 8122(b)).</P>

                <SUBJECT>How and when is a notice of occupational disease filed?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) To claim benefits under the FECA, an employee who has a disease which he or she believes to be work-related must give notice of the condition in writing on Form CA-2, which may be obtained from the employer or from the Internet at <E T="03">www.dol.gov</E> under forms. The employee must forward this notice to the employer. Another person, including the employer, may do so on the employee's behalf. The person submitting a notice shall include the Social Security Number (SSN) of the injured employee. All such notices should be submitted electronically wherever feasible to facilitate processing of such claims. All employers that currently do not have such capability should create such a method by December 31, 2012. The claimant may withdraw his or her claim (but not the notice of occupational disease) by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any <PRTPAGE P="20"/>time before OWCP determines eligibility for benefits.</P>
                <P>(b) For occupational diseases sustained as a result of exposure to injurious work factors that occurs on or after September 7, 1974, a notice of occupational disease must be filed within three years of the onset of the condition. (The form contains the necessary words of claim.) The requirements for timely filing are described in § 10.100(b)(1) through (3).</P>
                <P>(c) However, in cases of latent disability, the time for filing claim does not begin to run until the employee has a compensable disability and is aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the causal relationship between the disability and the employment (see 5 U.S.C. 8122(b)).</P>

                <P>(a) Form CA-7 is used to claim compensation for periods of disability not covered by COP.</P>
                <P>(1) An employee who is disabled with loss of pay for more than three calendar days due to an injury, or someone acting on his or her behalf, must file Form CA-7 before compensation can be paid.</P>
                <P>(2) The employee shall complete the front of Form CA-7 and submit the form to the employer for completion and transmission to OWCP. The form should be completed as soon as possible, but no more than 14 calendar days after the date pay stops due to the injury or disease. All such notices should be submitted electronically wherever feasible to facilitate processing of such claims. All employers that currently do not have such capability should create such a method by December 31, 2012.</P>
                <P>(3) The requirements for filing claims are further described in 5 U.S.C. 8121.</P>
                <P>(b) Form CA-7 is also used to claim compensation for additional periods of disability following the initial injury.</P>
                <P>(1) It is the employee's responsibility to submit Form CA-7. Without receipt of such claim, OWCP has no knowledge of continuing wage loss. Therefore, while disability continues, the employee should submit a claim on Form CA-7 each two weeks until otherwise instructed by OWCP.</P>
                <P>(2) The employee shall complete the front of Form CA-7 and submit the form to the employer for completion and transmission to OWCP.</P>
                <P>(3) The employee is responsible for submitting, or arranging for the submittal of, medical evidence to OWCP which establishes both that disability continues and that the disability is due to the work-related injury. Form CA-20a is submitted with Form CA-7 for this purpose.</P>

                <P>Form CA-7 is used to claim compensation for impairment to a body part covered under the schedule established by 5 U.S.C. 8107. All such notices should be submitted electronically wherever feasible to facilitate processing of such claims. All employers that currently do not have such capability should create such a method by December 31, 2012. If Form CA-7 has already been filed to claim disability compensation, an employee may file a claim for such impairment by sending a letter to OWCP which specifies the nature of the benefit claimed. OWCP may create a form specifically for schedule award claims; if that form is created, only that form may be used to file a claim under 5 U.S.C. 8107.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How and when is a claim for recurrence filed?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A recurrence should be reported on Form CA-2a if that recurrence causes the employee to lose time from work and incur a wage loss, or if the employee experiences a renewed need for treatment after previously being released from care. However, a notice of recurrence should not be filed when a new injury, new occupational disease, or new event contributing to an already-existing occupational disease has occurred. In these instances, the employee should file Form CA-1 or CA-2.</P>
                <P>(b) The employee has the burden of establishing by the weight of reliable, probative and substantial evidence that the recurrence of disability is causally related to the original injury.</P>

                <P>(1) The employee must include a detailed factual statement as described on Form CA-2a. The employer may <PRTPAGE P="21"/>submit comments concerning the employee's statement.</P>
                <P>(2) The employee should arrange for the submittal of a detailed medical report from the attending physician as described on Form CA-2a. The employee should also submit, or arrange for the submittal of, similar medical reports for any examination and/or treatment received after returning to work following the original injury.</P>
                <P>(c) A claim for recurrence of disability is not available where OWCP has issued a loss of wage-earning capacity determination. Under that circumstance, the only method for claiming additional wage loss compensation is through a request to modify that determination. However, OWCP is not precluded from adjudicating a limited period of disability following the issuance of a loss of wage-earning capacity decision, such as where an employee has a demonstrated need for surgery.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How and when is a notice of death and claim for benefits filed?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) If an employee dies from a work-related traumatic injury or an occupational disease, any survivor may file a claim for death benefits using Form CA-5 or CA-5b, which may be obtained from the employer or from the Internet at <E T="03">www.dol.gov</E> under forms. The survivor must provide this notice in writing and forward it to the employer. Another person, including the employer, may do so on the survivor's behalf. The survivor may also submit the completed Form CA-5 or CA-5b directly to OWCP. The survivor shall disclose the SSNs of all survivors on whose behalf claim for benefits is made in addition to the SSN of the deceased employee. All such notices should be submitted electronically wherever feasible to facilitate processing of such claims. All employers that currently do not have such capability should create such a method by December 31, 2012. The survivor may withdraw his or her claim (but not the notice of death) by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any time before OWCP determines eligibility for benefits.</P>
                <P>(b) For deaths that occur on or after September 7, 1974, a notice of death must be filed within three years of the death. The form contains the necessary words of claim. The requirements for timely filing are described in § 10.100(b)(1) through (3).</P>
                <P>(c) However, in cases of death due to latent disability, the time for filing the claim does not begin to run until the survivor is aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the causal relationship between the death and the employment (see 5 U.S.C. 8122(b)).</P>
                <P>(d) The filing of a notice of injury or occupational disease will satisfy the time requirements for a death claim based on the same injury or occupational disease. If an injured employee or someone acting on the employee's behalf does not file a claim before the employee's death, the right to claim compensation for disability other than medical expenses ceases and does not survive.</P>
                <P>(e) A survivor must be alive to receive any payment; there is no vested right to such payment. A report as described in § 10.414 of this part must be filed once each year to support continuing payments of compensation.</P>

                <P>(b) If the employee is receiving continuation of pay (COP), the employer should give Form CA-7 to the employee by the 30th day of the COP period and submit the form to OWCP by the 40th day of the COP period. If the employee has not returned the form to the employer by the 40th day of the COP period, the employer should ask him or her to submit it as soon as possible.</P>
                <P>(c) Upon receipt of Form CA-7 from the employee, or someone acting on his or her behalf, the employer shall complete the appropriate portions of the form.

                <P>(d) Postal Service employees are not entitled to compensation or continuation of pay for the waiting period, the first three days of disability. Such employees may use annual leave, sick leave or leave without pay during that period; however, if the disability exceeds 14 days, the employee may have their sick leave or annual leave reinstated or receive pay for the time spent on leave without pay. This waiting period does not apply to the provision of medical care, and days of time loss for medical treatment only with no work-related disability do not count as part of the waiting period. A Postal Service employee seeking wage loss compensation for this period should utilize Form CA-7 to claim such benefits.</P>

                <P>Forms CA-1, CA-2, CA-5 and CA-5b describe the basic evidence required. OWCP may send a request for additional evidence to the claimant and to his or her representative, if any; however the burden of proof still remains with the claimant. Evidence should be submitted in writing. The evidence submitted must be reliable, probative and substantial. Each claim for compensation must meet five requirements before OWCP can accept it. These requirements, which the employee must establish to meet his or her burden of proof, are as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) The claim was filed within the time limits specified by the FECA;</P>
                <P>(b) The injured person was, at the time of injury, an employee of the United States as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) and § 10.5(h) of this part;</P>
                <P>(c) The fact that an injury, disease or death occurred;</P>
                <P>(d) The injury, disease or death occurred while the employee was in the performance of duty; and</P>
                <P>(e) The medical condition for which compensation or medical benefits is claimed is causally related to the claimed injury, disease or death. Neither the fact that the condition manifests itself during a period of Federal employment, nor the belief of the claimant that factors of employment caused or aggravated the condition, is sufficient in itself to establish causal relationship.</P>
                <P>(f) In all claims, the claimant is responsible for submitting, or arranging for submittal of, a medical report from the attending physician. For wage loss benefits, the claimant must also submit medical evidence showing that the condition claimed is disabling. The rules for submitting medical reports are found in §§ 10.330 through 10.333.</P>

The employer may include supporting documents such as witness statements, medical reports or records, or any other relevant information.</P>
                <P>(b) Any such statement shall be submitted to OWCP with the notice of traumatic injury or death, or within 30 calendar days from the date notice of occupational disease or death is received from the claimant. If the employer does not submit a written explanation to support the disagreement, OWCP may accept the claimant's report of injury as established.

                <P>(b) The employer may ascertain the events surrounding an injury and the extent of disability where it appears that an employee who alleges total disability may be performing other work, or may be engaging in activities which would indicate less than total disability. This authority is in addition to that given in § 10.118(a).

              <SUBJECT>What is continuation of pay?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For most employees who sustain a traumatic injury, the FECA provides that the employer must continue the employee's regular pay during any periods of resulting disability, up to a maximum of 45 calendar days. This is called continuation of pay, or COP. The employer, not OWCP, pays COP. Unlike wage loss benefits, COP is subject to taxes and all other payroll deductions that are made from regular income.</P>
              <P>(b) The employer must continue the pay of an employee, except for Postal Service employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8117 and as provided below in paragraph (c) of this section, who is eligible for COP, and may not require the employee to use his or her own sick or annual leave, unless the provisions of § 10.200(c), § 10.220, or § 10.222 apply. However, while continuing the employee's pay, the employer may controvert the employee's COP entitlement pending a final determination by OWCP. OWCP has the exclusive authority to determine questions of entitlement and all other issues relating to COP.</P>

              <P>(c) Postal Service employees are not entitled to continuation of pay for the <PRTPAGE P="25"/>first 3 days of temporary disability and may use annual, sick or leave without pay during that period, except that if the disability exceeds 14 days or is followed by permanent disability, the Postal Service employee may have that leave restored.</P>
              <P>(d) The FECA excludes certain persons from eligibility for COP. COP cannot be authorized for members of these excluded groups, which include but are not limited to: persons rendering personal service to the United States similar to the service of a civil officer or employee of the United States, without pay or for nominal pay; volunteers (for instance, in the Civil Air Patrol and Peace Corps); Job Corps and Youth Conservation Corps enrollees; individuals in work- study programs, and grand or petit jurors (unless otherwise Federal employees).</P>

                <P>(a) To be eligible for COP, a person must:</P>
                <P>(1) Have a “traumatic injury” as defined at § 10.5(ee) which is job-related and the cause of the disability, and/or the cause of lost time due to the need for medical examination and treatment;</P>
                <P>(2) File Form CA-1 within 30 days of the date of the injury (but if that form is not available, using another form would not alone preclude receipt); and</P>
                <P>(3) Begin losing time from work due to the traumatic injury within 45 days of the injury.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP may find that the employee is not entitled to COP for other reasons consistent with the statute (see § 10.220).</P>

                <SUBJECT>May an employee who uses leave after an injury later decide to use COP instead?</SUBJECT>
                <P>On Form CA-1, an employee may elect to use accumulated sick or annual leave, or leave advanced by the agency, instead of electing COP. The employee can change the election between leave and COP for prospective periods at any point while eligibility for COP remains. The employee may also change the election for past periods and request COP in lieu of leave already taken for the same period. In either situation, the following provisions apply:</P>
                <P>(a) The request must be made to the employer within one year of the date the leave was used or the date of the written approval of the claim by OWCP (if written approval is issued), whichever is later.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the employee is otherwise eligible, the agency shall restore leave taken in lieu of any of the 45 COP days. Where any of the 45 COP days remain unused, the agency shall continue pay prospectively.</P>
                <P>(c) The use of leave may not be used to delay or extend the 45-day COP period or to otherwise affect the time limitation as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8117. Therefore, any leave used during the period of eligibility counts towards the 45-day maximum entitlement to COP.</P>

                <P>(c) Ensure that relevant medical evidence is submitted to OWCP, and cooperate with OWCP in developing the claim.</P>
                <P>(d) Ensure that the treating physician specifies work limitations and provides them to the employer and/or representatives of OWCP.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does OWCP compute the number of days of COP used?</SUBJECT>
                <P>COP is payable for a maximum of 45 calendar days, and every day used is counted toward this maximum. The following rules apply:</P>
                <P>(a) Time lost on the day or shift of the injury does not count toward COP. (Instead, the agency must keep the employee in a pay status for that period);</P>
                <P>(b) The first COP day is the first day disability begins following the date of injury (providing it is within the 45 days following the date of injury), except where the injury occurs before the beginning of the work day or shift, in which case the date of injury is charged to COP;</P>
                <P>(c) Any part of a day or shift (except for the day of the injury) counts as a full day toward the 45 calendar day total;</P>
                <P>(d) Regular days off are included if COP has been used on the regular work days immediately preceding or following the regular day(s) off, and medical evidence supports disability; and</P>
                <P>(e) Leave used during a period when COP is otherwise payable is counted toward the 45-day COP maximum as if the employee had been in a COP status.</P>
                <P>(f) For employees with part-time or intermittent schedules, all calendar days on which medical evidence indicates disability are counted as COP days, regardless of whether the employee was or would have been scheduled to work on those days. The rate at which COP is paid for these employees is calculated according to § 10.216(b).</P>

                <SUBJECT>How is the pay rate for COP calculated?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The employer shall calculate COP using the period of time and the weekly pay rate.</P>
                <P>(a) The pay rate for COP purposes is equal to the employee's regular “weekly” pay (the average of the weekly pay over the preceding 52 weeks).</P>
                <P>(1) The pay rate excludes overtime pay, but includes other applicable extra pay except to the extent prohibited by law.</P>

                <P>(2) Changes in pay or salary (for example, promotion, demotion, within-<PRTPAGE P="27"/>grade increases, termination of a temporary detail, <E T="03">etc.</E>) which would have otherwise occurred during the 45-day period are to be reflected in the weekly pay determination.</P>
                <P>(b) The weekly pay for COP purposes is determined according to the following formulas:</P>
                <P>(1) For full or part-time workers (permanent or temporary) who work the same number of hours each week of the year (or of the appointment), the weekly pay rate is the hourly pay rate (A) in effect on the date of injury multiplied by ( × ) the number of hours worked each week (B): A × B = Weekly Pay Rate.</P>
                <P>(2) For part-time workers (permanent or temporary) who do not work the same number of hours each week, but who do work each week of the year (or period of appointment), the weekly pay rate is an average of the weekly earnings, established by dividing ( ÷ ) the total earnings (excluding overtime) from the year immediately preceding the injury (A) by the number of weeks (or partial weeks) worked in that year (B): A ÷ B = Weekly Pay Rate.</P>
                <P>(3) For intermittent and seasonal workers, whether permanent or temporary, who do not work either the same number of hours or every week of the year (or period of appointment), the weekly pay rate is the average weekly earnings established by dividing ( ÷ ) the total earnings during the full 12-month period immediately preceding the date of injury (excluding overtime) (A), by the number of weeks (or partial weeks) worked during that year (B) (that is, A ÷ B); or 150 times the average daily wage earned in the employment during the days employed within the full year immediately preceding the date of injury divided by 52 weeks, whichever is greater.</P>

                <P>If the employee cannot perform the duties of his or her regular position, but instead works in another job with different duties with no loss in pay, then COP is not chargeable. COP must be paid and the days counted against the 45 days authorized by law whenever an actual reduction of pay results from the injury, including a reduction of pay for the employee's normal administrative workweek that results from a change or diminution in his or her duties following an injury. However, this does not include a reduction of pay that is due solely to an employer being prohibited by law from paying extra pay to an employee for work he or she does not actually perform.</P>

                <P>If the employer doubts that the injury occurred, or that it is work-related, he or she should authorize medical care by completing Form CA-16 and checking block 6B of the form.

                <SUBJECT>Should the employer use a Form CA-16 to authorize medical testing when an employee is exposed to a workplace hazard just once?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Simple exposure to a workplace hazard, such as an infectious agent, does not constitute a work-related injury entitling an employee to medical treatment under the FECA. The employer therefore should not use a Form CA-16 to authorize medical testing for an employee who has merely been exposed to a workplace hazard, unless the employee has sustained an identifiable injury or medical condition as a result of that exposure. OWCP will authorize preventive treatment only under certain well-defined circumstances (see § 10.313).</P>
                <P>(b) Employers may be required under other statutes or regulations to provide their employees with medical testing and/or other services in situations described in paragraph (a) of this section. For example, regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR chapter XVII require employers to provide their employees with medical consultations and/or examinations when they either exhibit symptoms consistent with exposure to a workplace hazard, or when an identifiable event such as a spill, leak or explosion occurs and results in the likelihood of exposure to a workplace hazard. In addition, 5 U.S.C. 7901 authorizes employers to establish health programs whose staff can perform tests for workplace hazards, counsel employees for exposure or feared exposure to such hazards, and provide health care screening and other associated services.</P>

                <P>(a) The employee is entitled to receive all medical services, appliances or supplies which a qualified physician prescribes or recommends and which OWCP considers necessary to treat the work-related injury. Billing for these services is described in subpart I of this part. The employee need not be disabled to receive such treatment. If there is any doubt as to whether a specific service, appliance or supply is necessary to treat the work-related injury, the employee should consult <PRTPAGE P="30"/>OWCP prior to obtaining it through the automated authorization process described in § 10.800. OWCP may also utilize the services of a field nurse to facilitate and coordinate medical care for the employee. OWCP may contract with a specific provider or providers to supply such services or appliances, including durable medical equipment and prescribed medications.</P>
                <P>(b) Any qualified physician or qualified hospital may provide such services, appliances and supplies. Non-physician providers such as physicians' assistants, nurse practitioners and physical therapists may also provide authorized services for injured employees to the extent allowed by applicable Federal and State law.</P>
                <P>(c) Where OWCP has not contracted for the provision of appliances or supplies, only a supplier of durable medical equipment that is registered in Medicare's Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies Accreditation process may furnish such appliances and supplies. OWCP may apply a test of cost-effectiveness to appliances and supplies, may offset the cost of prior rental payments against a future purchase price, and may provide refurbished appliances where appropriate.</P>

                <P>(a) The services of chiropractors that may be reimbursed are limited by the FECA to treatment to correct a spinal subluxation. The costs of physical and related laboratory tests performed by or required by a chiropractor to diagnose such a subluxation are also payable.</P>
                <P>(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8101(3), a diagnosis of spinal “subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist” must appear in the chiropractor's report before OWCP can consider payment of a chiropractor's bill.</P>
                <P>(c) A chiropractor may interpret his or her x-rays to the same extent as any other physician. To be given any weight, the medical report must state that x-rays support the finding of spinal subluxation. OWCP will not necessarily require submittal of the x-ray, or a report of the x-ray, but the report must be available for submittal on request.</P>
                <P>(d) A chiropractor may also provide services in the nature of physical therapy under the direction of, and as prescribed by, a qualified physician.</P>

                <P>The FECA does not authorize payment for preventive measures such as vaccines and inoculations, and in general, preventive treatment may be a responsibility of the employing agency under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7901 (see § 10.303). However, OWCP can authorize treatment for the following conditions, even though such treatment is designed, in part, to prevent further injury:</P>
                <P>(a) Complications of preventive measures which are provided or sponsored by the agency, such as an adverse reaction to prophylactic immunization.</P>
                <P>(b) Actual or probable exposure to a known contaminant due to an injury, thereby requiring disease-specific measures against infection. Examples include the provision of tetanus antitoxin or booster toxoid injections for puncture wounds; administration of rabies vaccine for a bite from a rabid or potentially rabid animal; or appropriate measures where exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has occurred.</P>

                <P>(c) Conversion of tuberculin reaction from negative to positive following exposure to tuberculosis in the performance of duty. In this situation, the appropriate therapy may be authorized.<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Where injury to one eye has resulted in loss of vision, periodic examination of the uninjured eye to detect possible sympathetic involvement of the uninjured eye at an early stage.</P>

                <P>Yes, OWCP will pay for the services of an attendant where the need for such services has been medically documented. In the exercise of the discretion afforded by 5 U.S.C. 8111(a), the Director has determined that, except where attendant service payments were being made prior to January 4, 1999, direct payments to the claimant to cover such services will no longer be made. Rather, the cost of providing attendant services will be paid under section 8103 of the Act, and medical bills for these services will be considered under § 10.801, so long as the personal care services have been determined to be medically necessary and are provided by a home health aide, licensed practical nurse, or similarly trained individual, subject to requirements specified by OWCP. By paying for the services under section 8103, OWCP can better determine whether the services provided are necessary, and what type of provider is most qualified to provide adequate care to meet the needs of the injured employee. In addition, a system requiring the personal care provider to submit a bill to OWCP, where the amount billed will be subject to OWCP's fee schedule, will result in greater fiscal accountability.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Will OWCP pay for transportation to obtain medical treatment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The employee is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable and necessary expenses, including transportation needed to obtain authorized medical services, appliances or supplies. To determine what is a reasonable distance to travel, OWCP will consider the availability of services, the employee's condition, and the means of transportation. Generally, a roundtrip distance of up to 100 miles is considered a reasonable distance to travel. Travel should be undertaken by the shortest route, and if practical, by public conveyance. If the medical evidence shows that the employee is unable to use these means of transportation, OWCP may authorize travel by taxi or special conveyance.</P>
                <P>(b) For non-emergency medical treatment, if roundtrip travel of more than 100 miles is contemplated, or air transportation or overnight accommodations will be needed, the employee must submit a written request to OWCP for prior authorization with information describing the circumstances and necessity for such travel expenses. OWCP will approve the request if it determines that the travel expenses are reasonable and necessary, and are incident to obtaining authorized medical services, appliances or supplies. Requests for travel expenses that are often approved include those resulting from referrals to a specialist for further medical treatment, and those involving air transportation of an employee who lives in a remote geographical area with limited local medical services.</P>
                <P>(c) If a claimant disagrees with the decision of OWCP that requested travel expenses are either not reasonable or necessary, or are not incident to obtaining authorized medical services or supplies, he or she may utilize the appeals process described in subpart G of this part.</P>
                <P>(d) The standard form designated for medical travel refund requests is Form OWCP-957 and must be used to seek reimbursement under this section. This form can be obtained from OWCP.</P>

                <P>(a) When the physician originally selected to provide treatment for a work-related injury refers the employee to a specialist for further medical care, the employee need not consult OWCP for approval. In all other instances, however, the employee must submit a written request to OWCP with his or her reasons for desiring a change of physician.</P>

                <P>(b) OWCP will approve the request if it determines that the reasons submitted are sufficient. Requests that are often approved include those for transfer of care from a general practitioner <PRTPAGE P="32"/>to a physician who specializes in treating conditions like the work-related one, or the need for a new physician when an employee has moved. The employer may not authorize a change of physicians.</P>

                <P>OWCP sometimes needs a second opinion from a medical specialist. The employee must submit to examination by a qualified physician as often and at such times and places as OWCP considers reasonably necessary. The employee may have a qualified physician, paid by him or her, present at such examination. However, the employee is not entitled to have anyone else present at the examination unless there is rationalized medical evidence that establishes that someone else is needed in the room or OWCP decides that exceptional circumstances exist. Where an employee requires an accommodation, such as where a hearing-impaired employee needs an interpreter, the presence of an interpreter will be allowed. Also, OWCP may send a case file for second opinion review where actual examination is not needed, or where the employee is deceased.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What happens if the opinion of the physician selected by OWCP differs from the opinion of the physician selected by the employee?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) If one medical opinion holds more probative value, OWCP will base its determination of entitlement on that medical conclusion (see § 10.502). A difference in medical opinion sufficient to be considered a conflict occurs when two reports of virtually equal weight and rationale reach opposing conclusions (see <E T="03">James P. Roberts,</E> 31 ECAB 1010 (1980)).</P>
                <P>(b) If a conflict exists between the medical opinion of the employee's physician and the medical opinion of either a second opinion physician or an OWCP medical adviser or consultant, OWCP shall appoint a third physician to make an examination (see § 10.502). This is called a referee or impartial examination. OWCP will select a physician who is qualified in the appropriate specialty and who has had no prior connection with the case. The employee is not entitled to have anyone present at the examination unless OWCP decides that exceptional circumstances exist. For example, where a hearing-impaired employee needs an interpreter, the presence of an interpreter would be allowed. Also, a case file may be sent for referee or impartial medical review where there is no need for an actual examination, or where the employee is deceased.</P>

                <P>OWCP will pay second opinion and referee medical specialists directly.

                <P>(a) If an employee refuses to submit to or in any way obstructs an examination required by OWCP, including testing such as functional capacity determinations conducted in connection with an OWCP-directed medical examination, his or her right to compensation under the FECA is suspended under 5 U.S.C. 8123(d) until such refusal or obstruction stops. The action of the employee's representative is considered to be the action of the employee for purposes of this section. The employee will forfeit compensation otherwise paid or payable under the FECA for the period of the refusal or obstruction, and any compensation already paid for that period will be declared an overpayment and will be subject to recovery pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8129.</P>

                <P>(b) If the employee does not report for an OWCP-directed examination or in any way obstructs this examination, he or she may provide an explanation to OWCP within 14 days. If this explanation does not establish good cause for the employee's actions, entitlement to compensation will be suspended in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8123(d). Should the employee subsequently <PRTPAGE P="33"/>agree to attend the examination or cease the obstruction (as expressed in writing or by telephone documented on Form CA-110), OWCP will restore any periodic benefits to which the employee is entitled when the employee actually reports for and cooperates with the examination. Payment is retroactive to the date the employee agreed to attend or cease obstruction of the examination.</P>

                <P>(a) The OWCP fee schedule sets maximum limits on the amounts payable for many services (see § 10.805).

The provider may request reconsideration of the fee determination as set forth in §§ 10.812 and 10.813.</P>
                <P>(c) If the provider does not refund to the employee or credit to his or her account the amount of money paid in excess of the charge which OWCP allows, the employee should submit documentation of the attempt to obtain such refund or credit to OWCP. OWCP may make reasonable reimbursement to the employee after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>

However, the presumption of permanent total disability as a result of such loss may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, such as evidence of continued ability to work and to earn wages despite the loss.</P>
                <P>(b) Temporary total disability is defined as the inability to return to the position held at the time of injury or earn equivalent wages, or to perform other gainful employment, due to the work-related injury. Except as presumed under paragraph (a) of this section, an employee's disability status is always considered temporary pending return to work.</P>

                <SUBJECT>When and how is compensation for total disability paid?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Compensation is payable when an employee starts to lose pay if the injury causes permanent disability or if pay loss continues for more than 14 calendar days. Otherwise, compensation is payable on the fourth day after pay stops pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8117(a). Compensation may not be paid while an injured employee is in a continuation of pay status or receives pay for leave or, for Postal Service employees, for the first three days of temporary disability as described in 5 U.S.C. 8117(b) and § 10.200(c), except for medical or vocational rehabilitation benefits.</P>
                <P>(b) Compensation for total disability is payable at the rate of 66<FR>2/3</FR> percent of the pay rate if the employee has no dependents, or 75 percent of the pay rate if the employee has at least one dependent. (“Dependents” are defined at 5 U.S.C. 8110(a).)</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is partial disability?</SUBJECT>
                <P>An injured employee who cannot return to the position held at the time of injury (or earn equivalent wages) due to the work-related injury, but who is not totally disabled for all gainful employment, is considered to be partially disabled.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 10.403</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>When and how is compensation for partial disability paid?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) 5 U.S.C. 8115 outlines how compensation for partial disability is determined. If the employee has actual earnings which fairly and reasonably represent his or her wage-earning capacity, those earnings will form the basis for payment of compensation for partial disability. (See §§ 10.500 through 10.521 concerning return to work.) If the employee's actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent his or her wage-earning capacity, or if the employee has no actual earnings, OWCP uses the factors stated in 5 U.S.C. 8115 to select a position which represents his or her wage-earning capacity, which include the nature of the injury, the degree of physical impairment, the usual employment, the age of the employee, the employee's qualifications for other employment and the availability of suitable employment. However, OWCP will not secure employment for the employee in the position selected for establishing a wage-earning capacity.</P>
                <P>(b) Compensation for partial disability is payable as a percentage of the difference between the employee's pay rate for compensation purposes and the employee's wage-earning capacity. The percentage is 66<FR>2/3</FR> percent of this difference if the employee has no dependents, or 75 percent of this difference if the employee has at least one dependent.</P>
                <P>(c) The formula which OWCP uses to compute the compensation payable for partial disability employs the following terms: Pay rate for compensation purposes, which is defined in § 10.5(s) of this part; current pay rate, which means the salary or wages for the job held at the time of injury at the time of the determination; and earnings, which means the employee's actual earnings, or the salary or pay rate of the position selected by OWCP as representing the employee's wage-earning capacity.</P>
                <P>(d) The employee's wage-earning capacity in terms of percentage is computed by dividing the employee's earnings by the current pay rate. The comparison of earnings and “current” pay rate for the job held at the time of injury need not be made as of the beginning of partial disability. OWCP may use any convenient date for making the comparison as long as both wage rates are in effect on the date used for comparison.</P>
                <P>(e) The employee's wage-earning capacity in terms of dollars is computed by first multiplying the pay rate for compensation purposes by the percentage of wage-earning capacity. The resulting dollar amount is then subtracted from the pay rate for compensation purposes to obtain the employee's loss of wage-earning capacity.</P>

                <P>Compensation is provided for specified periods of time for the permanent loss or loss of use of certain members, organs and functions of the body. Such loss or loss of use is known as permanent impairment. Compensation for proportionate periods of time is payable for partial loss or loss of use of each member, organ or function. 5 U.S.C. 8107(b)(19). OWCP evaluates the degree of impairment to schedule members, organs and functions as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8107 according to the standards set forth in the specified (by OWCP) edition of the American Medical Association's <E T="03">Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.</E>

This benefit is separate and distinct from a death gratuity benefit under 5 U.S.C. 8102a and subpart J of this part.</P>

                <P>(b) If there is no child entitled to compensation, the employee's surviving spouse will receive compensation equal to 50 percent of the employee's monthly pay until death or remarriage before reaching age 55. Upon remarriage, the surviving spouse will be paid a lump sum equal to 24 times the monthly compensation payment (excluding compensation payable on account of another individual) to which <PRTPAGE P="37"/>the surviving spouse was entitled immediately before the remarriage. If remarriage occurs at age 55 or older, the lump-sum payment will not be paid and compensation will continue until death.</P>
                <P>(c) If there is a child entitled to compensation, the compensation for the surviving spouse will equal 45 percent of the employee's monthly pay plus 15 percent for each child, but the total percentage may not exceed 75 percent.</P>
                <P>(d) If there is a child entitled to compensation and no surviving spouse, compensation for one child will equal 40 percent of the employee's monthly pay. Fifteen percent will be awarded for each additional child, not to exceed 75 percent, the total amount to be shared equally among all children.</P>
                <P>(e) If there is no child or surviving spouse entitled to compensation, the parents will receive compensation equal to 25 percent of the employee's monthly pay if one parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent, or 20 percent each if both were wholly dependent on the employee, or a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Director if one or both were partially dependent on the employee. If there is a child or surviving spouse entitled to compensation, the parents will receive so much of the compensation described in the preceding sentence as, when added to the total percentages payable to the surviving spouse and children, will not exceed a total of 75 percent of the employee's monthly pay.</P>
                <P>(f) If there is no child, surviving spouse or dependent parent entitled to compensation, the brothers, sisters, grandparents and grandchildren will receive compensation equal to 20 percent of the employee's monthly pay to such dependent if one was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death; or 30 percent if more than one was wholly dependent, divided among such dependents equally; or 10 percent if no one was wholly dependent but one or more was partly dependent, divided among such dependents equally. If there is a child, surviving spouse or dependent parent entitled to compensation, the brothers, sisters, grandparents and grandchildren will receive so much of the compensation described in the preceding sentence as, when added to the total percentages payable to the children, surviving spouse and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 75 percent of the employee's monthly pay.</P>
                <P>(g) A child, brother, sister or grandchild may be entitled to receive death benefits until death, marriage, or reaching age 18. Regarding entitlement after reaching age 18, refer to § 10.417.</P>

A beneficiary in a claim for death benefits should promptly notify OWCP of any event which would affect his or her entitlement to continued compensation. The terms “marriage” and “remarriage” include common-law marriage as recognized and defined by State law in the State where the beneficiary resides. If a beneficiary, or someone acting on his or her behalf, receives a check or electronic payment which includes payment of compensation for any period after the date when entitlement ended, he or she must promptly return such funds to OWCP.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does a change in the number of beneficiaries affect the amount of compensation paid to the other beneficiaries?</SUBJECT>
                <P>If compensation to a beneficiary is terminated, the amount of compensation payable to one or more of the remaining beneficiaries may be reapportioned. Similarly, the birth of a posthumous child may result in a reapportionment of the amount of compensation payable to other beneficiaries. The parent, or someone acting on the child's behalf, shall promptly notify OWCP of the birth and submit a copy of the birth certificate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What reports are needed when compensation payments continue for children over age 18?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Compensation payable on behalf of a child, brother, sister, or grandchild, which would otherwise end when the person reaches 18 years of age, shall be continued if and for so long as he or she is not married and is either a student as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8101(17), or physically or mentally incapable of self-support.</P>
                <P>(b) At least once each year, OWCP will ask a beneficiary receiving compensation based on the student status of a dependent to provide proof of continuing entitlement to such compensation, including certification of school enrollment. The beneficiary is required to report any changes to student status in the interim.</P>
                <P>(c) Likewise, at least once each year unless otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, OWCP will ask a beneficiary or legal guardian receiving compensation based on a dependent's physical or mental inability to support himself or herself to submit a medical report verifying that the dependent's medical condition persists and that it continues to preclude self-support. If there is a change in that condition, the beneficiary or legal guardian is required to immediately report that change to OWCP.</P>

                <P>(d) In the case of a dependent incapable of self support due to that dependent's physical or mental disability where the status of that dependent is <PRTPAGE P="39"/>unlikely to change, a beneficiary or legal guardian may establish the permanency of that condition by submitting a well rationalized medical report which describes that condition and the ongoing prognosis of that condition. If the permanency of that condition is established by such a report, OWCP will not seek further information regarding that condition; however, if there is a change in that condition, the beneficiary or legal guardian is required to immediately report that change to OWCP.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How are cost-of-living adjustments applied?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In cases of disability, a beneficiary is eligible for cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8146a where injury-related disability began more than one year prior to the date the cost-of-living adjustment took effect. The employee's use of continuation of pay as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8118, or of sick or annual leave, during any part of the period of disability does not affect the computation of the one-year period.</P>
                <P>(b) Where an injury does not result in disability but compensation is payable for permanent impairment of a covered member, organ or function of the body, a beneficiary is eligible for cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8146a where the award for such impairment began more than one year prior to the date the cost-of-living adjustment took effect.</P>
                <P>(c) In cases of recurrence of disability, where the pay rate for compensation purposes is the pay rate at the time disability recurs, a beneficiary is eligible for cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8146a where the effective date of that pay rate began more than one year prior to the date the cost-of-living adjustment took effect.</P>
                <P>(d) In cases of death, entitlement to cost-of-living adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 8146a begins with the first such adjustment occurring more than one year after the date of death. However, if the death was preceded by a period of injury-related disability, compensation payable to the survivors will be increased by the same percentages as the cost-of-living adjustments paid or payable to the deceased employee for the period of disability, as well as by subsequent cost-of-living adjustments to which the survivors would otherwise be entitled.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May a beneficiary receive other kinds of payments from the Federal Government concurrently with compensation?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) 5 U.S.C. 8116(a) provides that a beneficiary may not receive wage-loss compensation concurrently with a Federal retirement or survivor annuity. The beneficiary must elect the benefit that he or she wishes to receive, and the election, once made, is revocable.</P>
                <P>(b) An employee may receive compensation concurrently with military retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services.</P>
                <P>(c) An employee may not receive compensation for total disability concurrently with severance pay or separation pay. However, an employee may concurrently receive compensation for partial disability or permanent impairment to a schedule member, organ or function with severance pay or separation pay.</P>
                <P>(d) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8116(d), a beneficiary may receive compensation under the FECA for either the death or disability of an employee concurrently with benefits under title II of the Social Security Act on account of the age or death of such employee. However, this provision of the FECA also requires OWCP to reduce the amount of any such compensation by the amount of any Social Security Act benefits that are attributable to the Federal service of the employee.</P>

                <P>(e) To determine the employee's entitlement to compensation, OWCP may require an employee to submit an affidavit or statement as to the receipt of any Federally funded or Federally assisted benefits. If an employee fails to submit such affidavit or statement within 30 days of the date of the request, his or her right to compensation shall be suspended until such time as the requested affidavit or statement is received. At that time compensation <PRTPAGE P="40"/>will be reinstated retroactive to the date of suspension provided the employee is entitled to such compensation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May compensation payments be issued in a lump sum?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In exercise of the discretion afforded under 5 U.S.C. 8135(a), OWCP has determined that lump-sum payments will not be made to persons entitled to wage-loss benefits (that is, those payable under 5 U.S.C. 8105 and 8106). Therefore, when OWCP receives requests for lump-sum payments for wage-loss benefits, OWCP will not exercise further discretion in the matter. This determination is based on several factors, including:</P>
                <P>(1) The purpose of the FECA, which is to replace lost wages;</P>
                <P>(2) The prudence of providing wage-loss benefits on a regular, recurring basis; and</P>
                <P>(3) The high cost of the long-term borrowing that is needed to pay out large lump sums.</P>
                <P>(b) However, a lump-sum payment may be made to an employee entitled to a schedule award under 5 U.S.C. 8107 where OWCP determines that such a payment is in the employee's best interest. Lump-sum payments of schedule awards generally will be considered in the employee's best interest only where the employee does not rely upon compensation payments as a substitute for lost wages (that is, the employee is working or is receiving annuity payments). An employee possesses no absolute right to a lump-sum payment of benefits payable under 5 U.S.C. 8107.</P>
                <P>(c) Lump-sum payments to surviving spouses are addressed in 5 U.S.C. 8135(b); payments to beneficiaries under 5 U.S.C. 8137 payable as a lump sum pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8135 are addressed in part 25 of this title.</P>

                <P>(a) As a general rule, compensation and claims for compensation are exempt from the claims of private creditors. Further, any attempt by a FECA beneficiary to assign his or her claim is null and void. However, pursuant to provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 659, and regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) at 5 CFR part 581, FECA benefits, including survivor's benefits, may be garnished to collect overdue alimony and child support payments.</P>
                <P>(b) Garnishment for child support and alimony may be requested by providing a copy of the State agency or court order to the district office handling the FECA claim.</P>

                <P>A beneficiary may be incapable of managing or directing the management of his or her benefits because of a mental or physical disability, or because of legal incompetence, or because he or she is under 18 years of age. In this situation, absent the appointment of a guardian or other party to manage the financial affairs of the claimant by a court or administrative body authorized to do so, OWCP in its sole discretion may approve a person to serve as the representative payee for funds due the beneficiary. Where a guardian or other party has been appointed by a court or administrative body authorized to do so to manage the financial affairs of the claimant, OWCP will recognize that individual as the representative payee.</P>

                <P>(a) In addition to providing narrative descriptions to recipients of benefits paid or payable, OWCP includes on each periodic check a clear indication of the period for which payment is being made. A form is sent to the recipient with each supplemental check which states the date and amount of the payment and the period for which <PRTPAGE P="41"/>payment is being made. For payments sent by electronic funds transfer (EFT), a notification of the date and amount of payment appears on the statement from the recipient's financial institution.</P>
                <P>(b) By these means, OWCP puts the recipient on notice that a payment was made and the amount of the payment. If the amount received differs from the amount indicated on the written notice or bank statement, the recipient is responsible for notifying OWCP of the difference. Absent affirmative evidence to the contrary, the beneficiary will be presumed to have received the notice of payment, whether mailed or transmitted electronically. For EFT payments, OWCP is entitled to presume receipt and acceptance of that payment once a recipient has had an opportunity to receive a statement from their financial institution.</P>

                <P>The individual may present this evidence to OWCP in writing or at a pre-recoupment hearing. The evidence must be presented or the hearing requested within 30 days of the date of the written notice of overpayment.

                <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances can OWCP waive recovery of an overpayment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) OWCP may consider waiving an overpayment only if the individual to whom it was made was not at fault in accepting or creating the overpayment. Each recipient of compensation benefits is responsible for taking all reasonable measures to ensure that payments he or she receives from OWCP are proper. The recipient must show good faith and exercise a high degree of care in regard to receipt of their benefits. Such care includes reporting events which may affect entitlement to or the amount of benefits, including reviewing their accounts and related statements (including electronic statements and records from their financial institutions involving EFT payments). A recipient who has done any of the following will be found to be at fault with respect to creating an overpayment:</P>
                <P>(1) Made an incorrect statement as to a material fact which he or she knew or should have known to be incorrect; or</P>
                <P>(2) Failed to provide information which he or she knew or should have known to be material; or</P>
                <P>(3) Accepted a payment which the recipient knew or should have known to be incorrect. (This provision applies only to the overpaid individual.)</P>
                <P>(b) Whether or not OWCP determines that an individual was at fault with respect to the creation of an overpayment depends on the circumstances surrounding the overpayment. The degree of care expected may vary with the complexity of those circumstances and the individual's capacity to realize that he or she is being overpaid.</P>

                <P>(a) Adjustment or recovery of the overpayment would defeat the purpose of the FECA (see § 10.436), or<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Adjustment or recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience (see § 10.437).</P>

                <P>(a) The fact that OWCP may have erred in making the overpayment, or that the overpayment may have resulted from an error by another Government agency, does not by itself relieve the individual who received the overpayment from liability for repayment if the individual also was at fault in accepting the overpayment.</P>
                <P>(b) However, OWCP may find that the individual was not at fault if failure to report an event affecting compensation benefits, or acceptance of an incorrect payment, occurred because:</P>
                <P>(1) The individual relied on misinformation given in writing by OWCP (or by another Government agency which he or she had reason to believe was connected with the administration of benefits) as to the interpretation of a pertinent provision of the FECA or its regulations; or</P>
                <P>(2) OWCP erred in calculating cost-of-living increases, schedule award length and/or percentage of impairment, or loss of wage-earning capacity.</P>

                <P>Recovery of an overpayment will defeat the purpose of the FECA if such recovery would cause hardship to a currently or formerly entitled beneficiary because:</P>
                <P>(a) The beneficiary from whom OWCP seeks recovery needs substantially all of his or her current income (including compensation benefits) to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses; and</P>
                <P>(b) The beneficiary's assets do not exceed a specified amount as determined by OWCP from data furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A higher amount is specified for a beneficiary with one or more dependents.</P>

                <P>(a) Recovery of an overpayment is considered to be against equity and good conscience when any individual who received an overpayment would experience severe financial hardship in attempting to repay the debt.</P>
                <P>(b) Recovery of an overpayment is also considered to be against equity and good conscience when any individual, in reliance on such payments or on notice that such payments would be made, gives up a valuable right or changes his or her position for the worse. In making such a decision, OWCP does not consider the individual's current ability to repay the overpayment.</P>
                <P>(1) To establish that a valuable right has been relinquished, it must be shown that the right was in fact valuable, that it cannot be regained, and that the action was based chiefly or solely in reliance on the payments or on the notice of payment. Donations to charitable causes or gratuitous transfers of funds to other individuals are not considered relinquishments of valuable rights.</P>
                <P>(2) To establish that an individual's position has changed for the worse, it must be shown that the decision made would not otherwise have been made but for the receipt of benefits, and that this decision resulted in a loss.</P>

This information is needed to determine whether or not recovery of an overpayment would defeat the purpose of the FECA, or be against equity and good conscience. This information will also be used to determine the repayment schedule, if necessary.</P>

                <P>(b) Failure to submit the requested information within 30 days of the request shall result in denial of waiver, and no further request for waiver shall <PRTPAGE P="43"/>be considered until the requested information is furnished.</P>

If no refund is made, OWCP shall decrease later payments of compensation, taking into account the probable extent of future payments, the rate of compensation, the financial circumstances of the individual, and any other relevant factors, so as to minimize any hardship. Should the individual die before collection has been completed, collection shall be made by decreasing later payments, if any, payable under the FECA with respect to the individual's death. If no further benefits are payable with respect to the individual's death, OWCP may also file a claim with the estate of the individual or seek repayment of the overpayment through other means including referral of the debt to the Treasury Department.</P>
                <P>(b) When an overpayment has been made to an individual who is not entitled to further payments, the individual shall refund to OWCP the amount of the overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her attention is called to same. The overpayment is subject to the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (as amended) and may be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as income. If the individual fails to make such refund, OWCP may recover the same through any available means, including offset of salary, annuity benefits, or other Federal payments, including tax refunds as authorized by the Tax Refund Offset Program, or referral of the debt to a collection agency or to the Department of Justice.</P>

                <P>(a) Benefits are available only while the effects of a work-related condition continue. Compensation for wage loss due to disability is available only for any periods during which an employee's work-related medical condition prevents him or her from earning the wages earned before the work-related injury. For example, an employee is not entitled to compensation for any wage-loss claimed on a CA-7 to the extent that evidence contemporaneous with the period claimed on a CA-7 establishes that an employee had medical work restrictions in place; that light duty within those work restrictions was available; and that the employee was previously notified in writing that such duty was available. Similarly, an employee receiving continuing periodic payments for disability was not prevented from earning <PRTPAGE P="44"/>the wages earned before the work-related injury if the evidence establishes that the employing agency had offered, in accordance with OWCP procedures, a temporary light duty assignment within the employee's work restrictions. (The penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 8106(c)(2) will not be imposed on such assignments under this paragraph.)</P>
                <P>(b) Each disabled employee is obligated to perform such work as he or she can. OWCP's goal is to return each disabled employee to work as soon as he or she is medically able. In determining what work qualifies under 5 U.S.C. 8115 for determining the wage-earning capacity for a particular disabled employee, OWCP considers all relevant factors, including the employee's current physical limitations, whether the work is available within the employee's demonstrated commuting area and the employee's qualifications to perform such work.</P>
                <P>(c) A disabled employee who refuses to seek or accept suitable employment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8106(c)(2) is not entitled to compensation.</P>
                <P>(d) Payment of medical benefits is available for all treatment necessary due to a work-related medical condition.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What medical evidence is necessary to support continuing receipt of compensation benefits?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The employee is responsible for providing sufficient medical evidence to justify payment of any compensation sought.</P>
                <P>(1) To support payment of continuing compensation where an employee has been found entitled to periodic benefits, narrative medical evidence must be submitted whenever OWCP requests it but ordinarily not less than once a year and with any filing of a form CA-1032. It must contain a physician's rationalized opinion as to whether the specific period of alleged disability is causally related to the employee's accepted injury or illness.</P>
                <P>(2) For those employees with more serious conditions not likely to improve and for employees over the age of 65, OWCP may require less frequent documentation, but ordinarily not less than once every three years.</P>
                <P>(3) The physician's opinion must be based on the facts of the case and the complete medical background of the employee, must be one of reasonable medical certainty and must include objective findings in support of its conclusions. Subjective complaints of pain are not sufficient, in and of themselves, to support payment of continuing compensation. Likewise, medical limitations based solely on the fear of a possible future injury are also not sufficient to support payment of continuing compensation. See § 10.330 for a fuller discussion of medical evidence.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP may require any kind of non-invasive testing to determine the employee's functional capacity. Failure to undergo such testing will result in a suspension of benefits. In addition, OWCP may direct the employee to undergo a second opinion or referee examination in any case it deems appropriate (see §§ 10.320 and 10.321).</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does OWCP evaluate evidence in support of continuing receipt of compensation benefits?</SUBJECT>
                <P>In considering the medical and factual evidence, OWCP will weigh the probative value of the attending physician's report, any second opinion physician's report, any other medical reports, or any other evidence in the file. If OWCP determines that the medical evidence supporting one conclusion is more consistent, logical, and well-reasoned than evidence supporting a contrary conclusion, OWCP will use the conclusion that is supported by the weight of the medical evidence as the basis for awarding or denying further benefits. If medical reports that are equally well-reasoned support inconsistent determinations of an issue under consideration, OWCP will direct the employee to undergo a third, impartial referee examination to resolve the issue, which will be given special weight in determining the issue.</P>

                <P>Upon authorizing medical care, the employer should advise the employee in writing as soon as possible of his or her obligation to return to work under § 10.210 and as defined in this subpart. The term “return to work” as used in this subpart is not limited to returning to work at the employee's normal worksite or usual position, but may include returning to work at other locations and in other positions. In general, the employer should make all reasonable efforts to place the employee in his or her former or an equivalent position, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(2), if the employee has fully recovered after one year. The Office of Personnel Management (not OWCP) administers this provision.</P>
                <P>(a) Where the employer has specific alternative positions available for partially disabled employees, the employer should advise the employee in writing of the specific duties and physical requirements of those positions.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the employer has no specific alternative positions available for an employee who can perform restricted or limited duties, the employer should advise the employee of any accommodations the agency can make to accommodate the employee's limitations due to the injury.</P>

                <P>The employer may monitor the employee's medical progress and duty status by obtaining periodic medical reports. Form CA-17 is usually adequate for this purpose. To aid in returning an injured employee to suitable employment, the employer may also contact the employee's physician in writing concerning the work limitations imposed by the effects of the injury and possible job assignments. (However, the employer shall not contact the physician by telephone or through personal visit.) When such contact is made, the employer shall send a copy of any such correspondence to OWCP and the employee, as well as a copy of the physician's response when received. The employer may also contact the employee at reasonable intervals to request periodic medical reports addressing his or her ability to return to work.</P>

                <P>Where the attending physician or OWCP notifies the employer in writing that the employee is partially disabled (that is, the employee can perform some work but not return to the position held at date of injury), the employer should act as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) If the employee can perform in a specific alternative position available in the agency, and the employer has advised the employee in writing of the specific duties and physical requirements, the employer shall notify the employee in writing immediately of the date of availability.</P>
                <P>(b) If the employee can perform restricted or limited duties, the employer should determine whether such duties are available or whether an existing job can be modified. If so, the employer shall advise the employee in writing of the duties, their physical requirements and availability.</P>
                <P>(c) The employer must make any job offer in writing. However, the employer may make a job offer verbally as long as it provides the job offer to the employee in writing within two business days of the verbal job offer.</P>

                <P>(d) The offer must include a description of the duties of the position, the physical requirements of those duties, <PRTPAGE P="46"/>and the date by which the employee is either to return to work or notify the employer of his or her decision to accept or refuse the job offer. The employer must send a complete copy of any job offer to OWCP when it is sent to the employee.</P>

If this is not practical, the employer may offer suitable reemployment at the employee's former duty station or other location. Where the distance between the location of the offered job and the location where the employee currently resides is at least 50 miles, OWCP may pay such relocation expenses as are considered reasonable and necessary if the employee has been terminated from the agency's employment rolls and would incur relocation expenses by accepting the offered reemployment. OWCP may also pay such relocation expenses when the new employer is other than a Federal employer. OWCP will notify the employee that relocation expenses are payable if it makes a finding that the job is suitable. To determine whether a relocation expense is reasonable and necessary, OWCP shall use as a guide the Federal travel regulations for permanent changes of duty station.</P>

                <P>In general, an employee will not be considered to have experienced a compensable recurrence of disability as defined in § 10.5(x) merely because his or her employer has eliminated the employee's light-duty position in a reduction-in-force or some other form of downsizing. When this occurs, OWCP will determine the employee's wage-earning capacity based on his or her actual earnings in such light-duty position if this determination is appropriate on the basis that such earnings fairly and reasonably represent the employee's wage-earning capacity and such a determination has not already been made and the employing agency has stated, in writing, that no other employment is available.</P>

                <P>A light-duty position that fairly and reasonably represents an employee's ability to earn wages may form the basis of a loss of wage-earning capacity determination if that light duty position is a classified position to which the injured employee has been formally reassigned. The position must conform to the established physical limitations of the injured employee; the employer must have a written position description outlining the duties and physical requirements; and the position must correlate to the type of appointment held by the injured employee at the time of injury. If these circumstances are present, a determination may be made that the position constitutes “regular” Federal employment. In the absence of a “light-duty position” as described in this paragraph, OWCP will assume that the employee was instead engaged in non-competitive, makeshift or odd lot employment which does not represent the employee's wage-earning capacity, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> work of the type provided to injured employees who cannot otherwise be employed by the Federal Government or in any well-known branch of the general labor market.</P>

                <P>If OWCP issues a formal loss of wage-earning capacity determination, including a finding of no loss of wage-earning capacity, that determination and rate of compensation, if applicable, remains in place until that determination is modified by OWCP. Modification of such a determination is only warranted where the party seeking the modification establishes either that there is a material change in the nature and extent of the injury-related condition, the employee has been retrained or otherwise vocationally rehabilitated, or the original determination was erroneous. However, OWCP is not precluded from adjudicating a limited period of disability following the <PRTPAGE P="47"/>issuance of a loss of wage-earning capacity decision, such as where an employee has a demonstrated need for surgery.</P>

                <P>(a) If an employee can resume regular Federal employment, he or she must do so.

In the alternative, the employee must accept suitable work offered to him or her. This work may be with the original employer or through job placement efforts made by or on behalf of OWCP.</P>

                <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 8104(a), OWCP may direct a permanently disabled employee to undergo vocational rehabilitation. To ensure that vocational rehabilitation services are available to all who might be entitled to benefit from them, an injured employee who has a loss of wage-earning capacity shall be presumed to be “permanently disabled,” for purposes of this section only, unless and until the employee proves that the disability is not permanent. If an employee without good cause fails or refuses to apply for, undergo, participate in, or continue to participate in a vocational rehabilitation effort when so directed, OWCP will act as follows:</P>
                <P>(a) Where a suitable job has been identified, OWCP will reduce the employee's future monetary compensation based on the amount which would likely have been his or her wage-earning capacity had he or she undergone vocational rehabilitation. OWCP will determine this amount in accordance with the job identified through the vocational rehabilitation planning process, which includes meetings with the OWCP nurse and the employer. The reduction will remain in effect until such time as the employee acts in good faith to comply with the direction of OWCP.</P>
                <P>(b) Where a suitable job has not been identified, because the failure or refusal occurred in the early but necessary stages of a vocational rehabilitation effort (that is, interviews, testing, counseling, functional capacity evaluations, and work evaluations), OWCP cannot determine what would have been the employee's wage-earning capacity.</P>
                <P>(c) Under the circumstances identified in paragraph (b) of this section, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, OWCP will assume that the vocational rehabilitation effort would have resulted in a return to work with no loss of wage-earning capacity, and OWCP will reduce the employee's monetary compensation accordingly (that is, to zero). This reduction will remain in effect until such time as the employee acts in good faith to comply with the direction of OWCP.</P>

Actual earnings will be used if they fairly and reasonably reflect the earning capacity.

                <SUBJECT>How are dependents defined, and what information must the employee report?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Dependents in disability cases are defined in § 10.405. While the employee has one or more dependents, the employee's basic compensation for wage loss or for permanent impairment shall be augmented as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8110. (The rules for death claims are found in § 10.414.)</P>

                <P>(b) An employee who is receiving augmented compensation on account of dependents must advise OWCP immediately of any change in the number or status of dependents. The employee should also promptly refund to OWCP any amounts received on account of augmented compensation after the right to receive augmented compensation has ceased. Any difference between actual entitlement and the amount already paid beyond the date entitlement ended is an overpayment <PRTPAGE P="50"/>of compensation and may be recovered pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8129 and other relevant statutes.</P>
                <P>(c) An employee who is receiving augmented compensation shall be periodically required to submit a statement as to any dependents, or to submit supporting documents such as birth or marriage certificates or court orders, to determine if he or she is still entitled to augmented compensation.</P>

                <P>If an employee fails to submit a requested statement or supporting document within 30 days of the date of the request, OWCP will suspend his or her right to augmented compensation until OWCP receives the requested statement or supporting document. At that time, OWCP will reinstate augmented compensation retroactive to the date of suspension, provided that the employee is entitled to receive augmented compensation.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What reports are needed when compensation payments continue for children over age 18?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Compensation payable on behalf of a child that would otherwise end when the child reaches 18 years of age will continue if and for so long as he or she is not married and is either a student as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8101(17), or physically or mentally incapable of self-support.</P>
                <P>(b) At least once each year, OWCP will ask an employee who receives compensation based on the student status of a child to provide proof of continuing entitlement to such compensation, including certification of school enrollment. The employee is required to report any changes to student status in the interim as soon as they occur.</P>
                <P>(c) Likewise, at least once each year, OWCP will ask an employee who receives compensation based on a child's physical or mental inability to support himself or herself, and who is not covered by § 10.417(d) of this part, to submit a medical report verifying that the child's medical condition persists and that it continues to preclude self- support. The employee is required to report any changes to that status in the interim.</P>
                <P>(d) If an employee fails to submit proof within 30 days of the date of the request, OWCP will suspend the employee's right to compensation until the requested information is received. At that time OWCP will reinstate compensation retroactive to the date of suspension, provided the employee is entitled to such compensation.</P>

                <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, where the evidence establishes that compensation should be either reduced or terminated, OWCP will provide the beneficiary with written notice of the proposed action and give him or her 30 days to submit relevant evidence or argument to support entitlement to continued payment of compensation.</P>
                <P>(b) Notice provided under this section will include a description of the reasons for the proposed action and a copy of the specific evidence upon which OWCP is basing its determination. Payment of compensation will continue until any evidence or argument submitted has been reviewed and an appropriate decision has been issued, or until 30 days have elapsed if no additional evidence or argument is submitted.</P>
                <P>(c) OWCP will not provide such written notice when the beneficiary has no reasonable basis to expect that payment of compensation will continue. For example, when a claim has been made for a specific period of time and that specific period expires, no written notice will be given.</P>
                <P>(d) Written notice will also not be given when a beneficiary dies, when OWCP either reduces or terminates compensation upon an employee's return to work, when OWCP terminates only medical benefits after a physician indicates that further medical treatment is not necessary or has ended, or when OWCP denies payment for a particular medical expense.</P>

                <P>(e) OWCP will also not provide such written notice when compensation is terminated, suspended or forfeited due to one of the following: A beneficiary's <PRTPAGE P="51"/>conviction for fraud in connection with a claim under the FECA; a beneficiary's incarceration based on any felony conviction; an employee's failure to report earnings from employment or self-employment; an employee's failure or refusal to either continue performing suitable work or to accept an offer of suitable work; or an employee's refusal to undergo or obstruction of a directed medical examination or treatment for substance abuse.</P>

                <P>(a) If the beneficiary submits evidence or argument prior to the issuance of the decision, OWCP will evaluate it in light of the proposed action and undertake such further development as it may deem appropriate, if any. Evidence or argument which is repetitious, cumulative, or irrelevant will not require any further development. If the beneficiary does not respond within 30 days of the written notice, OWCP will issue a decision consistent with its prior notice. OWCP will not grant any request for an extension of this 30-day period.</P>
                <P>(b) Evidence or argument which refutes the evidence upon which the proposed action was based will result in the continued payment of compensation. If the beneficiary submits evidence or argument which fails to refute the evidence upon which the proposed action was based but which requires further development, OWCP will not provide the beneficiary with another notice of its proposed action upon completion of such development. Once any further development of the evidence is completed, OWCP will either continue payment or issue a decision consistent with its prior notice.</P>

              <P>There are three methods for reviewing a formal decision of the OWCP (§§ 10.125 through 10.127 discuss how decisions are made). These methods are: reconsideration by the district office; a hearing before an OWCP hearing representative; and appeal to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB). For each method there are time limitations and other restrictions which may apply, and not all options are available for all decisions, so the employee should consult the requirements set forth below. Further rules governing appeals to the ECAB are found at part 501 of this title.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(b) OWCP will consider an untimely application for reconsideration only if the application demonstrates clear evidence of error on the part of OWCP in its most recent merit decision. The application must establish, on its face, that such decision was erroneous.</P>
                <P>(c) The year in which a claimant has to timely request reconsideration shall not include any period subsequent to an OWCP decision for which the claimant can establish through probative medical evidence that he or she is unable to communicate in any way and that his or her testimony is necessary in order to obtain modification of the decision.</P>

                <P>(a) A timely request for reconsideration may be granted if OWCP determines that the employee has presented evidence and/or argument that meets at least one of the standards described in § 10.606(b)(3). If reconsideration is granted, the case is reopened and the case is reviewed on its merits (see § 10.609).</P>

A decision denying an application for reconsideration cannot be the subject of another application for reconsideration. The only review for this type of non-merit decision is an appeal to the ECAB (see § 10.625), and OWCP will not entertain a request for reconsideration or a hearing on this decision denying reconsideration.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does OWCP decide whether new evidence requires modification of the prior decision?</SUBJECT>
                <P>When application for reconsideration is granted, OWCP will review the decision for which reconsideration is sought on the merits and determine whether the new evidence or argument requires modification of the prior decision.</P>
                <P>(a) After OWCP decides to grant reconsideration, but before undertaking the review, OWCP will send a copy of the reconsideration application to the employer, which will have 20 days from the date sent to comment or submit relevant documents. OWCP will provide any such comments to the employee, who will have 20 days from the date the comments are sent to him or her within which to comment. If no comments are received from the employer, OWCP will proceed with the merit review of the case. Where a reconsideration request pertains only to a medical issue (such as disability or a schedule award) not requiring comment from the employing agency, the employing agency will be notified that a request for reconsideration has been received, but OWCP is not required to wait 20 days for comment before reaching a determination, except when that claimant is deployed in an area of armed conflict.</P>
                <P>(b) A claims examiner who did not participate in making the contested decision will conduct the merit review of the claim. When all evidence has been reviewed, OWCP will issue a new merit decision, based on all the evidence in the record. A copy of the decision will be provided to the agency.</P>
                <P>(c) An employee dissatisfied with this new merit decision may again request reconsideration under this subpart or appeal to the ECAB. An employee may not request a hearing on this decision.</P>

                <P>The FECA specifies that an award for or against payment of compensation may be reviewed at any time on the Director's own motion. Such review may be made without regard to whether there is new evidence or information. If the Director determines that a review of the award is warranted (including, but not limited to circumstances indicating a mistake of fact or law or changed conditions), the Director (at any time and on the basis of existing evidence) may modify, rescind, decrease or increase compensation previously awarded, or award compensation previously denied. A review on the Director's own motion is not subject to <PRTPAGE P="53"/>a request or petition and none shall be entertained.</P>
                <P>(a) The decision whether or not to review an award under this section is solely within the discretion of the Director. The Director's exercise of this discretion is not subject to review by the ECAB, nor can it be the subject of a reconsideration or hearing request.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the Director reviews an award on his or her own motion, any resulting decision is subject as appropriate to reconsideration, a hearing and/or appeal to the ECAB.

                <P>A hearing is a review of an adverse decision by a hearing representative. Initially, the claimant can choose between two formats: An oral hearing or a review of the written record. At the discretion of the hearing representative, an oral hearing may be conducted by telephone, teleconference, videoconference or other electronic means. In addition to the evidence of record, the employee may submit new evidence to the hearing representative.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does a claimant obtain a hearing?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A claimant, injured on or after July 4, 1966, who has received a final adverse decision by the district office may obtain a hearing by writing to the address specified in the decision. The hearing request must be sent within 30 days (as determined by postmark or other carrier's date marking) of the date of the decision for which a hearing is sought. The claimant must not have previously submitted a reconsideration request (whether or not it was granted) on the same decision.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP will schedule an oral hearing and determine whether the oral hearing will be conducted in person, including whether the in person hearing will be by teleconference, videoconference or other electronic means. The claimant can request a change in the format from a hearing to a review of the written record by making a written request to the Branch of Hearings and Review. OWCP will grant a request received by the Branch of Hearings and Review within 30 days of: the date OWCP acknowledges the initial hearing request, or the date OWCP issues a notice setting a date for an oral hearing, in cases where the initial request was for, or was treated as a request for, an oral hearing. A request received after those dates will be subject to OWCP's discretion. The decision to grant or deny a change of format from a hearing to a review of the written record is not reviewable.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How is an oral hearing conducted?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The hearing representative retains complete discretion to set the time, place and method of the hearing, including the amount of time allotted for the hearing, considering the issues to be resolved. Any requests for reasonable accommodation by individuals with disabilities should be made through the procedure described in the initial acknowledgement letter.</P>
                <P>(b) Unless otherwise directed in writing by the claimant, the hearing representative will mail a notice of the time, place and method of the oral hearing to the claimant and any representative at least 30 days before the scheduled date. The employer will also be mailed a notice at least 30 days before the scheduled date.</P>
                <P>(c) The hearing is an informal process, and the hearing representative is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure or by section 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act, but the hearing representative may conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. During the hearing process, the claimant may state his or her arguments and present new written evidence in support of the claim. Hearings are limited to one hour; this limitation may be extended in the discretion of the hearing representative.</P>

                <P>(d) Testimony at oral hearings, including those conducted by teleconference, videoconference or other electronic means, is recorded, then transcribed and placed in the record. Oral <PRTPAGE P="54"/>testimony shall be made under oath. The transcript of the hearing is the official record of the hearing.</P>
                <P>(e) OWCP will furnish a transcript of the oral hearing to the claimant and the employer, who have 20 days from the date it is sent to comment. The employer shall send any comments to OWCP and the claimant, who will have 20 more days from the date of the agency's certificate of service to comment.</P>
                <P>(f) The hearing remains open for the submittal of additional evidence until 30 days after the hearing is held, unless the hearing representative, in his or her sole discretion, grants an extension. Only one such extension may be granted. A copy of the decision will be mailed to the claimant's last known address, to any representative, and to the employer.</P>
                <P>(g) The hearing representative determines the conduct of the oral hearing and may terminate the hearing at any time he or she determines that all relevant evidence has been obtained, or because of misbehavior on the part of the claimant and/or representative.</P>
                <P>(h) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8126, if an individual disobeys or resists a lawful order or process in proceedings under this part, or misbehaves during a hearing or in a manner so as to obstruct the hearing, OWCP may certify the facts to the appropriate U.S. District Court, which may, if the evidence warrants, punish the individual in the same manner and to the same extent as for a contempt committed before the court, or commit the individual on the same conditions as if the forbidden act had occurred with reference to the process of or in the presence of the court.</P>

The hearing representative may also conduct whatever investigation is deemed necessary. New evidence and arguments are to be submitted at any time up to the time specified by OWCP, but they should be submitted as soon as possible to avoid delaying the hearing process.</P>
                <P>(b) The claimant should submit, with his or her application for review, all evidence or argument that he or she wants to present to the hearing representative. If the claimant chooses to change the request from an oral hearing to a review of the written record, the claimant should submit all evidence or argument at that time. A copy of all pertinent material will be sent to the employer, which will have 20 days from the date it is sent to comment. (Medical evidence is not considered “pertinent” for review and comment by the agency, and it will therefore not be furnished to the agency. OWCP has sole responsibility for evaluating medical evidence.) The employer shall send any comments to OWCP and the claimant, who will have 20 more days from the date of the agency's certificate of service to comment.</P>

The hearing representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, records, correspondence, papers or other relevant documents.

                <P>(2) Explain in the original request for a subpoena why the testimony or evidence is directly relevant to the issues at hand, and a subpoena is the best method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there are no other means by which the documents or testimony could have been obtained.<PRTPAGE P="55"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) No subpoena will be issued for attendance of employees of OWCP acting in their official capacities as decision-makers or policy administrators. For hearings taking the form of a review of the written record, no subpoena for the appearance of witnesses will be considered.</P>
                <P>(c) The hearing representative issues the subpoena under his or her own name. It may be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested (or equivalent service from a commercial carrier), addressed to the person to be served at his or her last known principal place of business or residence. A decision to deny a subpoena can only be appealed as part of an appeal of any adverse decision which results from the hearing.</P>

Scheduling (including format) is at the sole discretion of the hearing representative, and is not reviewable.</P>
                <P>(c) Once the oral hearing is scheduled and OWCP has mailed appropriate written notice to the claimant and representative, OWCP will, upon submission of proper written documentation of unavoidable serious scheduling conflicts (such as court-ordered appearances/trials, jury duty or previously scheduled outpatient procedures), entertain requests from a claimant or his representative for rescheduling as long as the hearing can be rescheduled on the same monthly docket, generally no more than 7 days after the originally scheduled time. When a request to postpone a scheduled hearing under this subsection cannot be accommodated on the docket, no further opportunity for an oral hearing will be provided. Instead, the hearing will take the form of a review of the written record and a decision issued accordingly.</P>

                <P>(d) Where the claimant or representative is hospitalized for a non-elective reason or where the death of the claimant's or representative's parent, <PRTPAGE P="56"/>spouse, child or other immediate family prevents attendance at the hearing, OWCP will, upon submission of proper documentation, grant a postponement beyond one monthly docket.</P>
                <P>(e) Decisions regarding rescheduling under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section are within the sole discretion of the hearing representative and are not reviewable.</P>
                <P>(f) A claimant who fails to appear at a scheduled hearing may request in writing within 10 days after the date set for the hearing that another hearing be scheduled. Where good cause for failure to appear is shown, another hearing will be scheduled and conducted by teleconference. The failure of the claimant to request another hearing within 10 days, or the failure of the claimant to appear at the second scheduled hearing without good cause shown, shall constitute abandonment of the request for a hearing. Where good cause is shown for failure to appear at the second scheduled hearing, review of the matter will proceed as a review of the written record.</P>

However, certain types of final decisions, described in this part as not subject to further review, cannot be appealed to the ECAB. Decisions that are not appealable to the ECAB include: Decisions concerning the amounts payable for medical services, decisions concerning exclusion and reinstatement of medical providers, decisions by the Director to review an award on his or her own motion, and denials of subpoenas independent of the appeal of the underlying decision. In appeals before the ECAB, attorneys from the Office of the Solicitor of Labor shall represent OWCP.</P>

                <P>While a case is on appeal to the ECAB, OWCP has no jurisdiction over the claim with respect to issues which directly relate to the issue or issues on appeal. The OWCP continues to administer the claim and retains jurisdiction over issues unrelated to the issue or issues on appeal and issues which arise after the appeal as a result of ongoing administration of the case. Such issues would include, for example, the ability to terminate benefits where an individual returns to work while an appeal is pending at the ECAB. ECAB's rules of procedure are found at part 501 of this title.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May a claimant designate a representative?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The claims process under the FECA is informal. Unlike many workers' compensation laws, the employer is not a party to the claim, and OWCP acts as an impartial evaluator of the evidence. Nevertheless, a claimant may appoint one individual to represent his or her interests, but the appointment must be in writing.</P>
                <P>(b) There can be only one representative at any one time, so after one representative has been properly appointed, OWCP will not recognize another individual as representative until the claimant withdraws the authorization of the first individual. In addition, OWCP will recognize only certain types of individuals (see § 10.701); however if the representative is an attorney, OWCP may communicate with any member of that attorney's recognized law firm.</P>
                <P>(c) A properly appointed representative who is recognized by OWCP may make a request or give direction to OWCP regarding the claims process, including a hearing. This authority includes presenting or eliciting evidence, making arguments on facts or the law, and obtaining information from the case file, to the same extent as the claimant.</P>

A Federal employee may act as a representative only:</P>

                <P>(a) A representative may charge the claimant a fee and other costs associated with the representation before OWCP. The claimant is solely responsible for paying the fee and other charges. The claimant will not be reimbursed by OWCP, nor is OWCP in any way liable for the amount of the fee. Contingency fees are not allowed in any form.</P>
                <P>(b) Administrative costs (mailing, copying, messenger services, travel and the like, but not including secretarial services, paralegal and other activities) need not be approved before the representative collects them. Before any fee for services can be collected, however, the fee must be approved by the Secretary.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Fee application.</E> The representative must submit the fee application to OWCP for services rendered before OWCP. (Representative services before ECAB must be approved by ECAB under 20 CFR part 501.) The application submitted to OWCP shall contain the following:</P>
                <P>(1) An itemized statement showing the representative's hourly rate, the number of hours worked and specifically identifying the work performed and a total amount charged for the representation (excluding administrative costs).</P>
                <P>(2) A statement of agreement or disagreement with the amount charged, signed by the claimant. The statement must also acknowledge that the claimant is aware that he or she must pay the fees and that OWCP is not responsible for paying the fee or other costs.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval where there is no dispute.</E> Where a fee application that describes the services rendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section is accompanied by a signed statement indicating the claimant's agreement with the fee as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the application is deemed approved except that no contingency fee arrangement may be considered deemed approved through this process.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Disputed requests.</E> (1) Where the claimant disagrees with the amount of the fee, as indicated in the statement accompanying the submittal, OWCP will evaluate the objection and decide whether or not to approve the request. OWCP will provide a copy of the request to the claimant and ask him or her to submit any further information in support of the objection within 15 days from the date the request is forwarded. After that period has passed, OWCP will evaluate the information received to determine whether the amount of the fee is substantially in excess of the value of services received by looking at the following factors:</P>
                <P>(i) Usefulness of the representative's services;</P>
                <P>(ii) The nature and complexity of the claim;</P>
                <P>(iii) The actual time spent on development and presentation of the claim; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Customary local charges for services for a representative of similar background and experience.</P>
                <P>(2) Where the claimant disputes the representative's request and files an objection with OWCP, an appealable decision will be issued.</P>

This includes an injured employee, and in the case of a claim involving the death of an employee, a spouse, children or other dependents entitled to receive survivor's benefits. OWCP or SOL should be notified in writing within 30 days of the receipt of such money or other property or the acceptance of the FECA claim, whichever occurs later.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How is the amount of the recovery of the FECA beneficiary determined?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When a FECA beneficiary is entitled to receive money as a result of a judgment entered in a lawsuit or settlement of a lawsuit or any other settlement or recovery from a responsible third party, the entire amount of the award is reported as the gross recovery. To determine the amount of the recovery of the FECA beneficiary, deductions are made for the portion representing damage to real or personal property, the portion representing loss of consortium, the portion representing wrongful death and the portion representing a survival action. To make deductions for loss of consortium, wrongful death and survival action, it must be established that:</P>
                <P>(1) These claims were asserted in the suit (or if there was no suit that these claims were included in the settlement or recovery); and</P>
                <P>(2) That such claims are permissible under the state law where the action was brought.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP or SOL will determine the appropriate percentage of the total judgment or settlement that will be allocated for loss of consortium, wrongful death action and survival action. FECA beneficiaries may accept OWCP's or SOL's determination or demonstrate good cause in writing for a different allocation. Whether to accept a specific allocation is at the discretion of OWCP or SOL, even where it has been incorporated into the settlement agreement. OWCP or SOL will not determine the appropriate percentage to be allocated for loss of consortium, wrongful death action and survival action if a judge or jury specifies the percentage to be awarded of a contested verdict attributable to each of several plaintiffs; in such case, OWCP or SOL will accept that percentage allocation.</P>
                <P>(c) The amount of the recovery of the FECA beneficiary will be determined as followed:</P>
                <P>(1) If a settlement or judgment is paid to or for one individual, the recovery is the gross recovery less the portion representing damage to real or personal property. The portion representing damage to real or personal property must be established in writing and approved by OWCP or SOL.</P>
                <P>(2) In any case involving an injury to an employee where a judgment or settlement is paid to or on behalf of more than one individual, the recovery is the gross recovery less the portion representing damage to real or personal property and less the portion representing loss of consortium. OWCP or SOL will allocate up to 25% for a spouse and up to 5% for each child not to exceed 15% for all children for loss of consortium.</P>

                <P>(3) In any case involving the death of an employee, where both wrongful death and survival actions have been asserted, separate statements of recovery are completed for the deceased employee and the surviving FECA beneficiaries. For the deceased employee, the recovery is the gross recovery less the portion representing damage to real or personal property, less the portion representing loss of consortium, less the portion representing the <PRTPAGE P="60"/>wrongful death action. For the surviving spouse and children, the recovery is the gross recovery less the portion representing damage to real or personal property, less the portion representing loss of consortium, less the portion representing the survival action. OWCP or SOL will allocate the total judgment or settlement as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) For loss of consortium, OWCP or SOL will allocate up to 15% for a spouse and up to 5% for each child not to exceed 10% for all children;</P>
                <P>(ii) For the wrongful death action, OWCP or SOL will allocate 65% of the remainder after subtraction of the amounts attributed to loss of consortium;</P>
                <P>(iii) For the survival action, OWCP or SOL will allocate 35% percent of the remainder after subtraction of the amounts attributed to loss of consortium.</P>
                <P>(d) In any case involving an injury to an employee where a judgment or settlement is paid to or on behalf of more than one individual and in any case involving the death of an employee, court costs will be attributed using the same percentages as was used for loss of consortium, wrongful death action and survival action. Attorney fees will be determined using the same percentage that was used for the gross recovery. These calculations are used only for the purpose of determining the amount of the refund and if applicable the surplus.</P>

              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 10.712</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How much of any settlement or judgment must be paid to the United States?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The statute permits a FECA beneficiary to retain, as a minimum, one-fifth of the net amount of money or property remaining after a reasonable attorney's fee and the costs of litigation have been deducted from the third-party recovery. The United States shares in the attorney fees by allowing the beneficiary to retain, at the time of distribution, an amount equivalent to a reasonable attorney's fee proportionate to the refund due the United States. After the refund owed to the United States is calculated, the FECA beneficiary retains any surplus remaining, and this amount is credited, dollar for dollar, against future compensation including wage-loss compensation, schedule award benefits and medical benefits for the same injury, as defined in § 10.719. OWCP will resume the payment of compensation only after the FECA beneficiary has been awarded compensation which exceeds the amount of the surplus.</P>
                <P>(a) The refund to the United States is calculated as follows, using the Statement of Recovery form approved by OMB:</P>
                <P>(1) Determine the amount of the recovery of the FECA beneficiary as set forth in § 10.711 as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Set out the gross recovery which is the entire amount of the award;</P>
                <P>(ii) Subtract the amount of award representing damage to real or personal property approved by OWCP or SOL (Subtotal A);</P>
                <P>(iii) Multiply Subtotal A by the appropriate percentage in § 10.711(c), or if it is a contested verdict by the percentage allocated by the judge or jury, and subtract this amount from Subtotal A (Subtotal B);</P>
                <P>(iv) If both a wrongful death action and survival action have been asserted, multiply Subtotal B by 65% to determine the amount allocated to the wrongful death case and multiply Subtotal B by 35% to determine the amount allocated to the survival action, or if it is a contested verdict, by the percentage allocated by the judge or jury. Separate Statements of Recovery must be completed for each cause of action. For the wrongful death action use the result of Subtotal B times 65% for Subtotal C and for the survival action use the result of Subtotal B times 35% for Subtotal C. If both a wrongful death and survival have not been asserted the amount in Subtotal B is used for Subtotal C;</P>
                <P>(v) Subtotal C is the amount of recovery of the FECA beneficiary;</P>

                <P>(2) Subtract the amount of attorney's fees actually paid, but not more than the maximum amount of attorney's fees considered by OWCP or SOL to be reasonable, from Subtotal C. This is calculated by first determining the attorney fee percentage which is determined by dividing the gross recovery into the amount of attorney's fees actually paid, but the attorney's fee <PRTPAGE P="61"/>amount must not be more than the maximum amount of attorney's fees considered to be reasonable by OWCP or SOL and must be approved by OWCP or SOL. Subtotal C is multiplied by the fee percentage and this amount is subtracted from Subtotal C (Subtotal D);</P>
                <P>(3) Subtract the costs of litigation, as allowed by OWCP or SOL from Subtotal D (Subtotal E). If loss of consortium and/or wrongful death and survival actions are claimed, the costs of litigation are reduced first by the percentage used for loss of consortium and then by the percentage used for wrongful death or survival action as set forth in § 10.711;</P>
                <P>(4) Multiply Subtotal E by 20% and subtract this amount from Subtotal E (Subtotal F);</P>
                <P>(5) Compare Subtotal F and the refundable disbursements as defined in § 10.714. Subtotal G is the lower of the two amounts;</P>
                <P>(6) Multiply Subtotal G by the percentage used for attorney's fees in paragraph (a)(2), to determine the Government's allowance for attorney's fees, and subtract this amount from Subtotal G. This is the amount of the refund.</P>
                <P>(b) The credit against future benefits (also referred to as the surplus) is calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) If Subtotal F, as calculated according to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is less than the refundable disbursements, as defined in § 10.714, there is no credit to be applied against future benefits (but the remainder of the unused disbursements must be applied to any future recovery for the same injury);</P>
                <P>(2) If Subtotal F is greater than the refundable disbursements, the credit against future benefits (or surplus) amount is determined by subtracting the refundable disbursements from Subtotal F.</P>
                <P>(c) Examples of how these calculations are made follows:</P>
                <P>(1) In this example, a Federal employee sues another party for causing injuries for which the employee has received $22,000 in benefits under the FECA, subject to refund. The suit is settled and the injured employee receives $100,000, all of which was for his injury. The injured worker paid attorney's fees of $25,000 and costs for the litigation of $3,000.</P>

                <P>(3) In this example, a Federal employee who is married with two minor children is killed in the performance of duty. A suit for wrongful death and survival is filed which includes claims for loss of consortium all of which is permitted under state law.

Two Statements of Recovery are completed: One for the wrongful death claim and the other for the survival action. Disbursements in this case were $30,000 for the deceased employee and $100,000 for the surviving spouse and children.</P>

If such an attribution is both practicable and equitable, as determined by OWCP or SOL, in its discretion, the conditions will be treated as separate injuries for purposes of calculating the refund and credit owed to the United States under section 8132.</P>

                <P>(a) Any injury sustained by a volunteer or volunteer leader while he or she is located abroad is deemed proximately caused by Peace Corps employment and will be found by OWCP to have been sustained in the performance of duty, and any illness contracted while that volunteer is located abroad will be found by OWCP to be proximately caused by the employment unless the evidence establishes:</P>
                <P>(1) The injury or illness was caused by the claimant's willful misconduct, intent to bring about the injury or death of self or another, or was proximately caused by the intoxication by alcohol or illegal drugs of the injured claimant; or</P>

                <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances are benefits payable in LEO claims?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Benefits are payable when an officer is injured while apprehending, or attempting to apprehend, an individual for the commission of a Federal crime. However, either an actual Federal crime must be in progress or have been committed, or objective evidence (of which the officer is aware at the time of injury) must exist that a potential Federal crime was in progress or had already been committed. The actual or potential Federal crime must be an integral part of the criminal activity toward which the officer's actions are directed. The fact that an injury to an officer is related in some way to the commission of a Federal crime does not necessarily bring the injury within the coverage of the FECA. The FECA is not intended to cover officers who are merely enforcing local laws.</P>
                <P>(b) For benefits to be payable when an officer is injured preventing, or attempting to prevent, a Federal crime, there must be objective evidence that a Federal crime is about to be committed. An officer's belief, unsupported by objective evidence, that he or she is acting to prevent the commission of a Federal crime will not result in coverage. Moreover, the officer's subjective intent, as measured by all available evidence (including the officer's own statements and testimony, if available), must have been directed toward the prevention of a Federal crime. In this context, an officer's own statements and testimony are relevant to, but do not control, the determination of coverage.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What kind of objective evidence of a potential Federal crime must exist for coverage to be extended?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Based on the facts available at the time of the event, the officer must have an awareness of sufficient information which would lead a reasonable officer, under the circumstances, to conclude that a Federal crime was in progress, or was about to occur. This awareness need not extend to the precise particulars of the crime (the section of Title 18, United States Code, for example), but there must be sufficient evidence that the officer was in fact engaged in actual or attempted apprehension of a Federal criminal or prevention of a Federal crime.</P>

                <P>(a) Where an officer is detailed by a competent State or local authority to assist a Federal law enforcement authority in the protection of the President of the United States, or any other person actually provided or entitled to U.S. Secret Service protection, coverage will be extended.</P>
                <P>(b) Coverage for officers of the U.S. Park Police and those officers of the Uniformed Division of the U.S. Secret Service who participate in the District of Columbia Retirement System is adjudicated under the principles set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and does not extend to numerous tangential activities of law enforcement (for example, reporting to work, changing clothes). However, officers of the Non-Uniformed Division of the U.S. Secret Service who participate in the District of Columbia Retirement System are covered under the FECA during the performance of all official duties.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How are benefits calculated in LEO claims?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Except for continuation of pay, eligible officers and survivors are entitled to the same benefits as if the officer had been an employee under 5 U.S.C. 8101. However, such benefits may be reduced or adjusted as OWCP in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect comparable benefits which the officer or survivor received or would have been entitled to receive by virtue of the officer's employment.</P>
                <P>(b) For the purpose of this section, a comparable benefit includes any benefit that the officer or survivor is entitled to receive because of the officer's employment, including pension and disability funds, State workers' compensation payments, Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act payments, and State and local lump-sum payments. Health benefits coverage and proceeds of life insurance policies purchased by the employer are not considered to be comparable benefits.</P>
                <P>(c) The FECA provides that, where an officer receives comparable benefits, compensation benefits are to be reduced proportionally in a manner that reflects the relative percentage contribution of the officer and the officer's employer to the fund which is the source of the comparable benefit. Where the source of the comparable benefit is a retirement or other system which is not fully funded, the calculation of the amount of the reduction will be based on a per capita comparison between the contribution by the employer and the contribution by all covered officers during the year prior to the officer's injury or death.</P>
                <P>(d) The non-receipt of compensation during a period where a dual benefit (such as a lump-sum payment on the death of an officer) is being offset against compensation entitlement does not result in an adjustment of the respective benefit percentages of remaining beneficiaries because of a cessation of compensation under 5 U.S.C. 8133(c).</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do providers enroll with OWCP for authorizations and billing?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) All providers must enroll with OWCP or its designated bill processing agent (hereinafter OWCP in this subpart) to have access to the automated authorization system and to submit medical bills to OWCP. To enroll, the provider must complete and submit a Form OWCP-1168 to the appropriate location noted on that form. By completing and submitting this form, providers certify that they satisfy all applicable Federal and State licensure and regulatory requirements that apply to their specific provider or supplier type. The provider must maintain documentary evidence indicating that it satisfies those requirements. The provider is also required to notify OWCP immediately if any information provided to OWCP in the enrollment process changes. Agency medical officers, private physicians and hospitals are also required to keep records of all cases treated by them under the FECA so they can supply OWCP with a history of the injury, a description of the nature and extent of injury, the results of any diagnostic studies performed, the nature of the treatment rendered and the degree of any impairment and/or disability arising from the injury.</P>
                <P>(b) Where a medical provider intends to bill for a procedure where prior authorization is required, that provider must request such authorization from OWCP.</P>
                <P>(c) After enrollment, a provider must submit all medical bills to OWCP through its bill processing portal and include the Provider Number/ID obtained through enrollment or other identifying number required by OWCP.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 10.801</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How are medical bills to be submitted?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) All charges for medical and surgical treatment, appliances or supplies furnished to injured employees, except for treatment and supplies provided by nursing homes, shall be supported by medical evidence as provided in § 10.800. <PRTPAGE P="68"/>OWCP may withhold payment for services until such report or evidence is provided. The physician or provider shall itemize the charges on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500 (for professional services or medicinal drugs dispensed in the office), Form OWCP-04 or UB-04 (for hospitals), an electronic or paper-based bill that includes required data elements (for pharmacies) or other form as warranted and accepted by OWCP, and submit the form promptly to OWCP.</P>
                <P>(b) The provider shall identify each service performed using the Physician's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, the National Drug Code (NDC), or the Revenue Center Code (RCC) with a brief narrative description; OWCP has discretion to determine which of these codes may be utilized in the billing process. The Director also has the authority to create and supply specific procedure codes that will be used by OWCP to better describe and allow specific payments for special services. These OWCP-created codes will be issued to providers by OWCP as appropriate and may only be used as authorized by OWCP. For example, a physician conducting a referee or second opinion examination under 5 U.S.C. 8123 will be furnished an OWCP-created code; a provider may not use such an OWCP-created code for other types of medical examinations or services. Where no appropriate code is submitted to identify the services performed, the bill will be returned to the provider and/or denied.</P>
                <P>(c) For professional charges billed on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500, the provider shall also state each diagnosed condition and furnish the corresponding diagnostic code using the “International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification” (ICD-9-CM), or as revised. A separate bill shall be submitted when the employee is discharged from treatment or monthly, if treatment for the work-related condition is necessary for more than 30 days.</P>
                <P>(1) (i) Hospitals shall submit charges for inpatient medical and surgical treatment or supplies promptly to OWCP on Form OWCP-04 or UB-04.</P>
                <P>(ii) For outpatient billing, the provider shall identify each service performed, using Revenue Center Codes (RCCs) and HCPCS/CPT codes as warranted. The charge for each individual service, or the total charge for all identical services, should also appear on the form. OWCP may adopt an Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OWCP OPPS) (as developed and implemented by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS) for Medicare, while modifying the allowable costs under Medicare to account for deductibles and other additional costs which are covered by FECA). Once adopted, hospital providers shall submit outpatient hospital bills on the current version of the Universal Billing Form (UB) and use HCPCS codes and other coding schemes in accordance with the OWCP OPPS.</P>
                <P>(2) Pharmacies shall itemize charges for prescription medications, appliances, or supplies on electronic or paper-based bills and submit them promptly to OWCP. Bills for prescription medications must include the NDC assigned to the product, the generic or trade name of the drug provided, the prescription number, the quantity provided, and the date the prescription was filled.</P>
                <P>(3) Nursing homes shall itemize charges for appliances, supplies or services on the provider's billhead stationery and submit them promptly to OWCP. Such charges shall be subject to any applicable OWCP fee schedule.</P>

                <P>(d) By submitting a bill and/or accepting payment, the provider signifies that the service for which reimbursement is sought was performed as described, necessary, appropriate and properly billed in accordance with accepted industry standards. For example, accepted industry standards preclude upcoding billed services for extended medical appointments when the employee actually had a brief routine appointment, or charging for the services of a professional when a paraprofessional or aide performed the service; industry standards prohibit unbundling services to charge separately for services that should be billed as a single charge. In addition, the provider thereby agrees to comply with all regulations set forth in this subpart <PRTPAGE P="69"/>concerning the rendering of treatment and/or the process for seeking reimbursement for medical services, including the limitation imposed on the amount to be paid for such services.</P>
                <P>(e) In summary, bills submitted by providers must: Be itemized on the Health Insurance Claim Form (for physicians) or the OWCP-04 (for hospitals); contain the signature or signature stamp of the provider; and identify the procedures using HCPCS/CPT codes, RCCs, or NDCs. Otherwise, OWCP may deny the bill, and the provider must correct and resubmit the bill.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 10.802</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How should an employee prepare and submit requests for reimbursement for medical expenses, transportation costs, loss of wages, and incidental expenses?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If an employee has paid bills for medical, surgical or dental services, supplies or appliances due to an injury sustained in the performance of duty and seeks reimbursement for those expenses, he or she may submit a request for reimbursement on Form OWCP-915, together with an itemized bill on Form OWCP-1500, CMS-1500, OWCP-04 or UB-04 prepared by the provider and a medical report as provided in § 10.800, to OWCP.</P>
                <P>(1) The provider of such service shall state each diagnosed condition and furnish the applicable ICD-9-CM code, or as revised, and identify each service performed using the applicable HCPCS/CPT code, with a brief narrative description of the service performed, or, where no code is applicable, a detailed description of that service. If no code or description is received, OWCP will deny the reimbursement request and correction and resubmission will be required.</P>
                <P>(2) The reimbursement request must be accompanied by evidence that the provider received payment for the service from the employee and a statement of the amount paid. Acceptable evidence that payment was received includes, but is not limited to, a signed statement by the provider, a mechanical stamp or other device showing receipt of payment, a copy of the employee's canceled check (both front and back) or a copy of the employee's credit card receipt or a form indicating a balance of zero to the provider.</P>
                <P>(b) If services were provided by a hospital, pharmacy or nursing home, the employee should submit the bill in accordance with the provisions of § 10.801(a). Any request for reimbursement must be accompanied by evidence, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, that the provider received payment for the service from the employee and a statement of the amount paid.</P>
                <P>(c) OWCP may waive the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if extensive delays in the filing or the adjudication of a claim make it unusually difficult for the employee to obtain the required information.</P>
                <P>(d) OWCP will not accept copies of bills for reimbursement unless they bear the signature of the provider, with evidence of payment. Payment for medical and surgical treatment, appliances or supplies shall in general be no greater than the maximum allowable charge for such service determined by the Director, as set forth in § 10.805.</P>
                <P>(e) An employee will be only partially reimbursed for a medical expense if the amount he or she paid to a provider for the service exceeds the maximum allowable charge set by the Director's schedule. If this happens, OWCP shall advise the employee of the maximum allowable charge for the service in question and of his or her responsibility to ask the provider to refund to the employee, or credit to the employee's account, the amount he or she paid which exceeds the maximum allowable charge. The provider may request reconsideration of the fee determination as set forth in § 10.812.</P>
                <P>(f) If the provider fails to make appropriate refund to the employee, or to credit the employee's account, within 60 days after the employee requests a refund of any excess amount, or the date of a subsequent reconsideration decision which continues to disallow all or a portion of the appealed amount, the provider shall be subject to exclusion procedures as provided by § 10.815.</P>

                <P>(g) If the provider does not refund to the employee or credit to his or her account the amount of money paid in excess of the charge which OWCP allows, the employee should submit documentation of the attempt to obtain <PRTPAGE P="70"/>such refund or credit to OWCP. OWCP may make reasonable reimbursement to the employee after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>
                <P>(h) If an employee seeks reimbursement for transportation costs, loss of wages or incidental expenses related to medical treatment under this part, that employee may submit such reimbursement request on the Medical Travel Refund Request OWCP-957 form to OWCP along with all proof of payment. Requests for reimbursement for lost wages under this subsection must include an official statement from the employing agency indicating the amount of wage loss.</P>

                <P>OWCP will pay providers and reimburse employees promptly for all bills received on an approved form and in a timely manner. However, no bill will be paid for expenses incurred if the bill is submitted more than one year beyond the end of the calendar year in which the expense was incurred or the service or supply was provided, or more than one year beyond the end of the calendar year in which the claim was first accepted as compensable by OWCP, whichever is later.</P>

                <P>(a) Payment for medical and other health services, devices and supplies furnished by physicians, hospitals, and other providers for work-related injuries shall not exceed a maximum allowable charge for such service as determined by the Director, except as provided in this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The schedule of maximum allowable charges does not apply to charges for services provided in nursing home for employees admitted to that nursing home prior to August 29, 2011, but does apply to all charges for services provided by a nursing home where the employee was admitted to that nursing home after that date.

                <SUBJECT>How are the maximum fees defined?</SUBJECT>
                <P>For professional medical services, the Director shall maintain a schedule of maximum allowable fees for procedures performed in a given locality. The schedule shall consist of: An assignment of Relative Value Units (RVU) to procedures identified by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System/Current Procedural Terminology (HCPCS/CPT) code which represents the relative skill, effort, risk and time required to perform the procedure, as compared to other procedures of the same general class; an assignment of Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) values which represent the relative work, practice expenses and malpractice expenses relative to other localities throughout the country; and a monetary value assignment (conversion factor) for one unit of value for each coded service.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 10.807</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How are payments for particular services calculated?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Payment for a procedure, service or device identified by a HCPCS/CPT code shall not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the Relative Value Units (RVU) values for that procedure by the Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) values for services in that area and by the conversion factor to arrive at a dollar amount assigned to one unit in that category of service.</P>
                <P>(a) The “locality” which serves as a basis for the determination of cost is defined by the Office of Management and Budget Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The Director shall base the determination of the relative per capita cost of medical care in a locality using information about enrollment and medical cost per county, provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</P>

                <P>(b) The Director shall assign the RVUs published by CMS to all services <PRTPAGE P="71"/>for which CMS has made assignments, using the most recent revision. Where there are no RVUs assigned to a procedure, the Director may develop and assign any RVUs that he or she considers appropriate. The geographic adjustment factor shall be that designated by GPCI for Metropolitan Statistical Areas as devised for CMS and as updated or revised by CMS from time to time. The Director will devise conversion factors for each category of service as appropriate using OWCP's processing experience and internal data.</P>

                <P>(c) For example, if the RVUs for a particular surgical procedure are 2.48 for physician's work (W), 3.63 for practice expense (PE), and 0.48 for malpractice insurance (MP), and the conversion factor assigned to one unit in that category of service (surgery) is $61.20, then the maximum allowable charge for one performance of that procedure is the product of the three RVUs times the corresponding GPCI values for the locality times the conversion factor. If the GPCI values for the locality are 0.988(W), 0.948 (PE), and 1.174 (MP), then the maximum payment calculation is:
                </P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">[(2.48)(0.988) + (3.63)(0.948) + (0.48)(1.174)] × $61.20</FP>

                <P>Where the time, effort and skill required to perform a particular procedure vary widely from one occasion to the next, the Director may choose not to assign a relative value to that procedure. In this case the allowable charge for the procedure will be set individually based on consideration of a detailed medical report and other evidence. At its discretion, OWCP may set fees without regard to schedule limits for specially authorized consultant examinations, for examinations performed under 5 U.S.C. 8123, and for other specially authorized services.</P>

                <P>Payment for medicinal drugs prescribed by physicians shall not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the average wholesale price, or as otherwise specified by OWCP, of the medication by the quantity or amount provided, plus a dispensing fee. OWCP may, in its discretion, contract for or require the use of specific providers for certain medications.</P>
                <P>(a) All prescription medications identified by National Drug Code (NDC) will be assigned an average wholesale price representing the product's nationally recognized wholesale price as determined by surveys of manufacturers and wholesalers, or by other method designated by OWCP. The Director will establish the dispensing fee, which will not be affected by the location or type of provider dispensing the medication.</P>
                <P>(b) The NDCs, the average wholesale prices, and the dispensing fee shall be reviewed from time to time and updated as necessary.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How are payments for inpatient medical services determined?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) OWCP will pay for inpatient medical services according to pre-determined, condition-specific rates based on the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) devised by CMS (42 CFR parts 412, 413, 424, 485, and 489). Using this system, payment is derived by multiplying the diagnosis-related group (DRG) weight assigned to the hospital discharge by the provider-specific factors.</P>
                <P>(1) All inpatient hospital discharges will be classified according to the DRGs prescribed by the CMS in the form of the DRG Grouper software program. Each DRG represents the average resources necessary to provide care in a case in that DRG relative to the national average of resources consumed per case.</P>

                <P>(2) The provider-specific factors will be provided by CMS in the form of their PPS Pricer software program. The software takes into consideration the type of facility, census division, actual geographic location (MSA) of the hospital, case mix cost per discharge, number of hospital beds, intern/beds ratio, operating cost to charge ratio, <PRTPAGE P="72"/>and other factors used by CMS to determine the specific rate for a hospital discharge under their PPS. The Director may devise price adjustment factors as appropriate using OWCP's processing experience and internal data.</P>
                <P>(3) OWCP will base payments to facilities excluded from CMS' IPPS on consideration of detailed medical reports and other evidence.</P>
                <P>(4) The Director shall review the pre-determined hospital rates at least once a year, and may adjust any or all components when he or she deems it necessary or appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) The Director shall review the schedule of fees at least once a year, and may adjust the schedule or any of its components when he or she deems it necessary or appropriate.</P>

If the code is not consistent with the medical evidence or where no code is supplied, the bill will be returned to the provider for correction and resubmission.</P>
                <P>(b) If the charge submitted for a service supplied to an injured employee exceeds the maximum amount determined to be reasonable according to the schedule, OWCP shall pay the amount allowed by the schedule for that service and shall notify the provider in writing that payment was reduced for that service in accordance with the schedule. OWCP shall also notify the provider of the method for requesting reconsideration of the balance of the charge.</P>

                <P>(a) A physician or other provider whose charge for service is only partially paid because it exceeds a maximum allowable amount set by the Director may, within 30 days, request reconsideration of the fee determination.</P>
                <P>(1) The provider should make such a request to the OWCP district office with jurisdiction over the employee's claim. The request must be accompanied by documentary evidence that the procedure performed was incorrectly identified by the original code, that the presence of a severe or concomitant medical condition made treatment especially difficult, or that the provider possessed unusual qualifications. In itself, board-certification in a specialty is not sufficient evidence of unusual qualifications to justify an exception. These are the only three circumstances which will justify reevaluation of the paid amount.</P>

                <P>(2) A list of OWCP district offices and their respective areas of jurisdiction is available upon request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Washington, DC 20210, or from the Internet at  <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov./owcp.</E> Within 30 days of receiving the request for reconsideration, the OWCP district office shall respond in writing stating whether or not an additional amount will be allowed as reasonable, considering the evidence submitted.</P>
                <P>(b) If the OWCP district office issues a decision which continues to disallow a contested amount, the provider may apply to the Regional Director of the region with jurisdiction over the OWCP district office. The application must be filed within 30 days of the date of such decision, and it may be accompanied by additional evidence. Within 60 days of receipt of such application, the Regional Director shall issue a decision in writing stating whether or not an additional amount will be allowed as reasonable, considering the evidence submitted. This decision shall be final, and shall not be subject to further review.</P>

If DOL OIG determines not to take any further action, it will promptly notify OWCP.</P>

                <P>(c) If DOL OIG discovers reasonable cause to believe that violations of § 10.815 have occurred, it shall, when appropriate, prepare a written report, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> investigative memorandum, and forward that report along with supporting evidence to OWCP. The report shall be in the form of a single memorandum in narrative form with attachments.</P>

              <P>(a) The death gratuity authorized by 5 U.S.C. 8102a and payable pursuant to the provisions of this subpart is a payment to a claimant who is an eligible survivor (as defined in §§ 10.906 and 10.907) or a designated alternate beneficiary (as defined in §§ 10.908 and 10.909) of an employee who dies of injuries incurred in connection with the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation. This payment was authorized by section 1105 of Public Law 110-181 (2008). For the purposes of this subchapter, the term “Armed <PRTPAGE P="78"/>Force” means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(b) This death gratuity payment is a FECA benefit, as defined by § 10.5(a) of this part. All the provisions and definitions in this part apply to claims for payment under this subpart unless otherwise specified.</P>

              <P>(b) “Children” means, without regard to age or marital status, the deceased employee's natural children and adopted children. It also includes any stepchildren who were a part of the decedent's household at the time of death.</P>
              <P>(1) A stepchild will be considered part of the decedent's household if the decedent and the stepchild share the same principal place of abode in the year prior to the decedent's death. The decedent and stepchild will be considered as part of the same household notwithstanding temporary absences due to special circumstances such as illness, education, business travel, vacation travel, military service, or a written custody agreement under which the stepchild is absent from the employee's household for less than 180 days of the year.</P>
              <P>(2) A natural child who is an illegitimate child of a male decedent is included in the definition of “children” under this subpart if:</P>
              <P>(i) The child has been acknowledged in writing signed by the decedent;</P>
              <P>(ii) The child has been judicially determined, before the decedent's death, to be his child;</P>

              <P>(iii) The child has been otherwise proved, by evidence satisfactory to the <PRTPAGE P="79"/>employing agency, to be the decedent's child; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The decedent had been judicially ordered to contribute to the child's support.</P>
              <P>(c) “Parent” or “parents” mean the deceased employee's natural father and mother or father and mother through adoption. It also includes persons who stood in loco parentis to the decedent for a period of not less than one year at any time before the decedent became an employee.</P>
              <P>(1) A person stood in loco parentis when the person assumed the status of parent toward the deceased employee. (Any person who takes a child of another into his or her home and treats the child as a member of his or her family, providing parental supervision, support, and education as if the child were his or her own child, will be considered to stand in loco parentis.)</P>
              <P>(2) Only one father and one mother, or their counterparts in loco parentis, may be recognized in any case.</P>
              <P>(3) Preference will be given to those who exercised a parental relationship on the date, or most nearly before the date, on which the decedent became an employee.</P>
              <P>(d) “Brother” and “sister” mean any person, without regard to age or marital status, who is a natural brother or sister of the decedent, a half-brother or half-sister, or a brother or sister through adoption. Step-brothers or step-sisters of the decedent are not considered a “brother” or a “sister.”</P>

              <P>If OWCP determines that an employee's death qualifies for the death gratuity, the FECA provides that the death gratuity payment will be disbursed to the living survivor(s) highest on the following list:</P>
              <P>(a) The employee's surviving spouse.</P>
              <P>(b) The employee's children, in equal shares.</P>
              <P>(c) The employee's parents, brothers, and sisters, or any combination of them, if designated by the employee pursuant to the designation procedures in § 10.909.</P>
              <P>(d) The employee's parents, in equal shares.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can an employee designate alternate beneficiaries to receive a portion of the death gratuity payment?</SUBJECT>
              <P>An employee may designate another person or persons to receive not more than 50 percent of the death gratuity payment pursuant to the designation procedures in § 10.909. Only living persons, rather than trusts, corporations or other legal entities, may be designated under this subsection. The balance of the death gratuity will be paid according to the order of precedence described in § 10.907.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does an employee designate a variation in the order or percentage of gratuity payable to survivors and how does the employee designate alternate beneficiaries?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Form CA-40 must be used to make a variation in the order or percentages of survivors under § 10.907 and/or to make an alternate beneficiary designation under § 10.908. A designation may be made at any time before the employee's death, regardless of the time of injury. The form will not be valid unless it is signed by the employee and received and signed prior to the death of the employee by the supervisor of the employee or by another official of the employing agency authorized to do so.</P>
              <P>(b) Alternatively, any paper executed prior to the effective date of this regulation that specifies an alternate beneficiary of the death gratuity payment will serve as a valid designation if it is in writing, completed before the employee's death, signed by the employee, and signed prior to the death of the employee by the supervisor of the employee or by another official of the employing agency authorized to do so.</P>
              <P>(c) If an employee makes a survivor designation under § 10.907(c), but does not designate the portions to be received by each designated survivor, the death gratuity will be disbursed to the survivors in equal shares.</P>

              <P>(d) An alternate beneficiary designation made under § 10.908 must indicate <PRTPAGE P="80"/>the percentage of the death gratuity, in 10 percent increments up to the maximum of 50 percent, that the designated person(s) will receive. No more than five alternate beneficiaries may be designated. If the designation fails to indicate the percentage to be paid to an alternate beneficiary, the designation to that person will be invalid.</P>

              <P>(a) If a person entitled to all or a portion of the death gratuity due to the order of precedence for survivors in § 10.907 dies after the death of the covered employee but before the person receives the death gratuity, the portion will be paid to the living survivors otherwise eligible according to the order of precedence prescribed in that subsection.</P>
              <P>(b) If a survivor designated under the survivor designation provision in § 10.907(c) dies after the death of the covered employee but before receiving his or her portion of the death gratuity, the survivor's designated portion will be paid to the next living survivors according to the order of precedence.</P>
              <P>(c) If a person designated as an alternate beneficiary under § 10.908 dies after the death of the covered employee but before the person receives his or her designated portion of the death gratuity, the designation to that person will have no effect. The portion designated to that person will be paid according to the order of precedence prescribed in § 10.907.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 10.911</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How is the death gratuity payment process initiated?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Either the employing agency or a living claimant (survivor or alternate beneficiary) may initiate the death gratuity payment process. If the death gratuity payment process is initiated by the employing agency notifying OWCP of the employee's death, each claimant must file a claim with OWCP in order to receive payment of the death gratuity. The legal representative or guardian of any minor child may file on the child's behalf. Alternatively, if a claimant initiates the death gratuity payment process by filing a claim, the employing agency must complete a death notification form and submit it to OWCP. Other claimants must also file a claim for their portion of the death gratuity.</P>
              <P>(b) The employing agency must notify OWCP immediately upon learning of an employee's death that may be eligible for benefits under this subpart, by submitting form CA-42 to OWCP. The agency must also submit to OWCP any designation forms completed by the employee, and the agency must provide as much information as possible about any living survivors or alternate beneficiaries of which the agency is aware.</P>
              <P>(1) OWCP will then contact any living survivor(s) or alternate beneficiary(ies) it is able to identify.</P>
              <P>(2) OWCP will furnish claim form CA-41 to any identified survivor(s) or alternate beneficiary(ies) and OWCP will provide information to them explaining how to file a claim for the death gratuity.</P>
              <P>(c) Alternatively, any claimant may file a claim for death gratuity benefits with OWCP. Form CA-41 may be used for this purpose. The claimant will be required to provide any information that he or she has regarding any other beneficiaries who may be entitled to the death gratuity payment. The claimant must disclose, in addition to the Social Security number (SSN) of the deceased employee, the SSNs (if known) and all known contact information of all other possible claimants who may be eligible to receive the death gratuity payment. The claimant must also identify, if known, the agency that employed the deceased employee when he or she incurred the injury that caused his or her death. OWCP will then contact the employing agency and notify the agency that it must complete and submit form CA-42 for the employee. OWCP will also contact any other living survivor(s) or alternate beneficiary(ies) it is able to identify, furnish to them claim form CA-41, and provide information explaining how to file a claim for the death gratuity.</P>

              <P>(d) If a claimant submits a claim for the death gratuity to an employing <PRTPAGE P="81"/>agency, the agency must promptly transmit the claim to OWCP. This includes both claim forms CA-41 and any other claim or paper submitted which appears to claim compensation on account of the employee's death.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 10.912</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What is required to establish a claim for the death gratuity payment?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Claim form CA-41 describes the basic requirements. Much of the required information will be provided by the employing agency when it completes notification form CA-42. However, the claimant bears the burden of proof to ensure that OWCP has the evidence needed to establish the claim. OWCP may send any request for additional evidence to the claimant and to his or her representative, if any. Evidence should be submitted in writing. The evidence submitted must be reliable, probative, and substantial. Each claim for the death gratuity must establish the following before OWCP can pay the gratuity:</P>
              <P>(a) That the claim was filed within the time limits specified by the FECA, as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 8122 and this part. Timeliness is based on the date that the claimant filed the claim for the death gratuity under § 10.911, not the date the employing agency submitted form CA-42. As procedures for accepting and paying retroactive claims were not available prior to the publication of the interim final rule, the applicable statute of limitations began to run for a retroactive payment under this subpart on August 18, 2009.</P>
              <P>(b) That the injured person, at the time he or she incurred the injury or disease, was an employee of the United States as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) and § 10.5(h) of this part, or a non-appropriated fund instrumentality employee, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 1587(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(c) That the injury or disease occurred and that the employee's death was causally related to that injury or disease. The death certificate of the employee must be provided. Often, the employing agency will provide the death certificate and any needed medical documentation. OWCP may request from the claimant any additional documentation that may be needed to establish the claim.</P>
              <P>(d) That the employee incurred the injury or disease in connection with the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation. This will be determined from evidence provided by the employing agency or otherwise obtained by OWCP and from any evidence provided by the claimant.</P>
              <P>(1) Section 8102a defines “contingency operation” to include humanitarian operations, peacekeeping operations, and similar operations. (“Similar operations” will be determined by OWCP.)</P>
              <P>(i) A “contingency operation” is defined by 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) as a military operation that—</P>
              <P>(A) Is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the armed forces are or may become involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force; or</P>
              <P>(B) Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of the uniformed services under section 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12305, or 12406 of Title 10, chapter 15 of Title 10, or any other provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or Congress.</P>
              <P>(ii) A “humanitarian or peacekeeping operation” is defined by 10 U.S.C. 2302(8) as a military operation in support of the provision of humanitarian or foreign disaster assistance or in support of a peacekeeping operation under chapter VI or VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The term does not include routine training, force rotation, or stationing.</P>

              <P>(iii) “Humanitarian assistance” is defined by 10 U.S.C. 401(e) to mean medical, surgical, dental, and veterinary care provided in areas of a country that are rural or are underserved by medical, surgical, dental, and veterinary professionals, respectively, including education, training, and technical assistance related to the care provided; construction of rudimentary surface transportation systems; well drilling and construction of basic sanitation facilities; rudimentary construction and repair of public facilities.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A contingency operation may take place within the United States or abroad. However, operations of the National Guard are only considered “contingency operations” for purposes of this subpart when the President, Secretary of the Army, or Secretary of the Air Force calls the members of the National Guard into service. A “contingency operation” does not include operations of the National Guard when called into service by a Governor of a State.</P>
              <P>(3) To show that the injury or disease was incurred “in connection with” the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation, the claim must show that the employee incurred the injury or disease while in the performance of duty as that phrase is defined for the purposes of otherwise awarding benefits under FECA.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) When the contingency operation occurs outside of the United States, OWCP will find that an employee's injury or disease was incurred “in connection with” the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation if the employee incurred the injury or disease while performing assignments in the same region as the operation, unless there is conclusive evidence that the employee's service was not supporting the Armed Force's operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Economic or social development projects, including service on Provincial Reconstruction Teams, undertaken by covered employees in regions where an Armed Force is engaged in a contingency operation will be considered to be supporting the Armed Force's operation.</P>
              <P>(5) To show that an employee's injury or disease was incurred “in connection with” the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation, the claimant will be required to establish that the employee's service was supporting the Armed Force's operation. The death gratuity does not cover Federal employees who are performing service within the United States that is not supporting activity being performed by an Armed Force.</P>
              <P>(e) The claimant must establish his or her relationship to the deceased employee so that OWCP can determine whether the claimant is the survivor entitled to receive the death gratuity payment according to the order of precedence prescribed in § 10.907.</P>

              <P>(a) OWCP will consider that an employee incurred injury in connection with service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation if:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee incurred injury while serving under the direction or supervision of an official of an Armed Force conducting a contingency operation; or</P>
              <P>(2) The employee incurred injury while riding with members of an Armed Force in a vehicle or other conveyance deployed to further an Armed Force's objectives in a contingency operation.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee may incur injury in connection with service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation in situations other than those listed above. Additional situations will be determined by OWCP on a case-by-case basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the responsibilities of the employing agency in the death gratuity payment process?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Because some of the information needed to establish a claim under this subpart will not be readily available to the claimants, the employing agency of the deceased employee has significant responsibilities in the death gratuity claim process. These responsibilities are as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) The agency must completely fill out form CA-42 immediately upon learning of an employee's death that may be eligible for benefits under this subpart. The agency must complete form CA-42 as promptly as possible if notified by OWCP that a survivor filed a claim based on the employee's death. The agency should provide as much information as possible regarding the circumstances of the employee's injury and his or her assigned duties at the time of the injury, so that OWCP can determine whether the injury was incurred in the performance of duty and whether the employee was performing service in connection with an Armed <PRTPAGE P="83"/>Force in a contingency operation at the time.</P>
              <P>(b) The employing agency must promptly transmit any form CA-41s received from claimants to OWCP. The employer must also promptly transmit to OWCP any other claim or paper submitted that appears to claim compensation on account of the employee's death.</P>
              <P>(c) The employing agency must maintain any designations completed by the employee and signed by a representative of the agency in the employee's official personnel file or a related system of records. The agency must forward any such forms to OWCP if the agency submits form CA-42 notifying OWCP of the employee's death. The agency must also forward any other paper signed by the employee and employing agency that appears to make designations of the death gratuity.</P>
              <P>(d) If requested by OWCP, the employing agency must determine whether a survivor, who is claiming the death gratuity based on his or her status as an illegitimate child of a deceased male employee, has offered satisfactory evidence to show that he or she is in fact the employee's child.</P>
              <P>(e) The employing agency must notify OWCP of any other death gratuity payments under any other law of the United States for which the employee's death qualifies. The employing agency also must notify OWCP of any other death gratuity payments that have been paid based on the employee's death.</P>
              <P>(f) Non-appropriated fund instrumentalities must fulfill the same requirements under this subpart as any other employing agency.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 10.915</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are the responsibilities of OWCP in the death gratuity payment process?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the death gratuity payment process is initiated by the employing agency's submission of form CA-42, OWCP will identify living potential claimants. OWCP will make a reasonable effort to provide claim form CA-41s to any known potential claimants and provide instructions on how to file a claim for the death gratuity payment.</P>
              <P>(b) If the death gratuity payment process is initiated by a claimant's submission of a claim, OWCP will contact the employing agency and prompt it to submit form CA-42. OWCP will then review the information provided by both the claim and form CA-42, and OWCP will attempt to identify all living survivors or alternate beneficiaries who may be eligible for payment of the gratuity.</P>
              <P>(c) If OWCP determines that the evidence is not sufficient to meet the claimant's burden of proof, OWCP will notify the claimant of the additional evidence needed. The claimant will be allowed at least 30 days to submit the additional evidence required. OWCP may also request additional information from the employing agency.</P>
              <P>(d) OWCP will review the information provided by the claimant and information provided by the employing agency to determine whether the claim satisfies all the requirements listed in § 10.912.</P>
              <P>(e) OWCP will calculate the amount of the death gratuity payment and pay the beneficiaries as soon as possible after accepting the claim.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 10.916</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How is the amount of the death gratuity calculated?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The death gratuity payment under this subpart equals $100,000 minus the amount of any death gratuity payments that have been paid under any other law of the United States based on the same death. A death gratuity payment is a payment in the nature of a gift, beyond reimbursement for death and funeral expenses, relocation costs, or other similar death benefits. Only other death gratuity payments will reduce the amount of the death gratuity provided in this subpart. For this reason, death benefits provided to the same employee's survivors such as those under 5 U.S.C. 8133 as well as benefits paid under 5 U.S.C. 8134 are not death gratuity payments, and therefore have no effect on the amount of the death gratuity provided under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(a) A payment provided under section 413 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3973), is a death gratuity payment, and if a deceased employee's survivors received that payment for the <PRTPAGE P="84"/>employee's death, the amount of the death gratuity paid to the survivors under this subpart would be reduced by the amount of the Foreign Service Act death gratuity. Other death gratuities that would affect the calculation of the amount payable include but are not limited to: the gratuity provision in section 1603 of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 (Pub. L. 109-234, June 15, 2006); the $10,000 death gratuity to the personal representative of civilian employees, at Title VI, Section 651 of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-208, September 30, 1996); the death gratuity for members of the Armed Forces or any employee of the Department of Defense dying outside the United States while assigned to intelligence duties, at 10 U.S.C. 1489; and the death gratuity for employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, at 50 U.S.C. 403k.</P>
              <P>(b) The amount of the death gratuity under this section will be calculated before it is disbursed to the employee's survivors or alternate beneficiaries, by taking into account any death gratuities paid by the time of disbursement. Therefore, any designations made by the employee under § 10.909 are only applicable to the amount of the death gratuity as described in paragraph (a) of this section. The following examples are intended to provide guidance in this administration of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Example One.</E> An employee's survivors are entitled to the Foreign Service Act death gratuity; the employee's spouse received payment in the amount of $80,000 under that Act. A death gratuity is also payable under FECA; the amount of the FECA death gratuity that is payable is a total of $20,000. That employee, using Form CA-40 had designated 50% of the death gratuity under this subpart to be paid to his neighbor John Smith who is still living. So, 50% of the death gratuity will be paid to his spouse and the remaining 50% of the death gratuity paid under this subpart would be paid to John Smith. This means the surviving spouse will receive $10,000 and John Smith will receive $10,000.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Example Two.</E> Employee dies in circumstances that would qualify her for payment of the gratuity under this subpart; her agency has paid the $10,000 death gratuity pursuant to Public Law 104-208. The employee had not completed any designation form. The FECA death gratuity is reduced by the $10,000 death gratuity and employee's spouse receives $90,000.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Example Three.</E> An employee of the Foreign Service whose annual salary is $75,000 dies in circumstances that would qualify for payment of both the Foreign Service Act death gratuity and the death gratuity under this subpart. Before his death, the employee designated that 40% of the death gratuity under this subpart be paid to his cousin Jane Smith, pursuant to the alternate beneficiary designation provision at § 10.908 and that 10% be paid to his uncle John Doe who has since died. At the time of his death, the employee had no surviving spouse, children, parents, or siblings. Therefore, the Foreign Service Act death gratuity will not be paid, because no eligible survivors according to the Foreign Service Act provision exist. The death gratuity under this subpart would equal $100,000, because no other death gratuity has been paid, and Jane would receive $40,000 according to the employee's designation. As John Doe is deceased, no death gratuity may be paid pursuant to the designation of a share of the death gratuity to him.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How are claims of Federal employees who are neither citizens nor residents adjudicated?</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part describes how OWCP pays compensation under the FECA to employees of the United States who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States, any territory or Canada, as well as to any dependents of such employees. It has been determined that the compensation provided under the FECA is substantially disproportionate to the compensation for disability or death which is payable in similar cases under local law, regulation, custom or otherwise, in areas outside the United States, any territory or Canada and therefore a special schedule should apply to such cases This special schedule applies to any non-citizen non-resident Federal employee who is neither hired nor employed in the United States, Canada or in a possession or territory of the United States. Therefore, with respect to the claims of such employees whose injury (or injury resulting in death) has occurred subsequent to August 29, 2011, or may occur, the regulations in this part shall apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>In general, what is the Director's policy regarding such claims?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8137(a)(2), a special schedule is established by subpart B of this part that applies to any non-citizen non-resident Federal employee who is neither hired nor employed in the United States, Canada or in a possession or territory of the United States (hereinafter non-citizen non-resident employees). The special schedule in subpart B of this part is subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The special schedule set forth in subpart B of this part applies to claims of such employees whose injury (or injury resulting in death) occurred on or after August 29, 2011.</P>
              <P>(b) This special schedule of compensation established by subpart B of this part shall apply to non-citizen non-resident employees outside of the United States unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The injured employee receives compensation pursuant to a specific separate agreement between the United States and another government (or similar compensation from another sovereign government);</P>
              <P>(2) The employee receives compensation pursuant to the special schedule under subpart C for the particular locality, or for a class of employees in that particular locality; or</P>
              <P>(3) The employee otherwise establishes entitlement to compensation under local law pursuant to § 25.100(e).</P>
              <P>(c) Compensation in all cases of such employees paid and closed prior to August 29, 2011 shall be deemed compromised and paid under 5 U.S.C. 8137. In all other cases, compensation may be adjusted to conform with the regulations in this part, or the beneficiary may by compromise or agreement with the Director have compensation continued on the basis of a previous adjustment of the claim.</P>

              <P>(d) Compensation received by beneficiaries pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8137 and the special schedule set forth in subpart B or as otherwise specified in paragraph (b) of this section is the exclusive measure of compensation in cases of injury (or death from injury) <PRTPAGE P="86"/>to non-citizen non-resident employees of the United States as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Compensation for disability and death of non-citizen non-resident employees outside the United States under this part shall in no event exceed that generally payable under the FECA.</P>

              <P>In addition to the authority to receive, process and pay claims, when delegated such representative or agency receiving delegation of authority shall, in respect to cases adjudicated under this part, and when so authorized by the Director, have authority to make lump-sum awards (in the manner prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 8135) whenever such authorized representative shall deem such settlement to be for the best interest of the United States, and to compromise and pay claims for any benefits provided for under this part, including claims in which there is a dispute as to questions of fact or law. The Director shall, in instructions to the particular representative concerned, establish such procedures in respect to action under this section as he or she may deem necessary, and may specify the scope of any administrative review of such action.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Temporary total disability.</E> Where the injured employee is disabled and unable to earn wages equivalent to those earned at the time of injury for a period of time less than two years, the employee shall receive 50 percent of the monthly pay during the period of such disability.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary partial disability.</E> Where the injured employee is disabled and unable to earn equivalent wages to those earned at the time of injury, but who is not totally disabled for work, the injured employee shall receive during the period of disability, that proportion of compensation for temporary total disability, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section, which is <PRTPAGE P="87"/>equal in percentage to the degree or percentage of physical impairment caused by the disability.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Permanent total disability.</E> Where it is found that the injured employee is disabled and will be or has been unable to earn equivalent wages to those earned at the time of injury for greater than two years, the employee is deemed permanently disabled.

              <P>(e) In the event a beneficiary covered under subpart B can demonstrate that the amount payable under the special schedule would result in a payment that would be demonstrably less than the amount payable under the law of his home country, the Director retains the discretion to pay that amount of compensation under 5 U.S.C. 8137(a)(2)(A), not to exceed the amount payable under FECA. To request benefits under this paragraph, the beneficiary must submit the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Translated copies of the applicable local statute as well as any regulations, policies and procedures the beneficiary avers are applicable; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>How is compensation for death of a non-citizen non-resident employee paid?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If the disability causes death, the compensation shall be payable in the amount and to or for the benefit of the following persons:</P>
              <P>(a) To the undertaker or person entitled to reimbursement, reasonable funeral expenses not exceeding $800.</P>
              <P>(b) To the surviving spouse, if there is no child, 30 percent of the monthly pay until his or her death or remarriage subject to the lump sum provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8135.</P>
              <P>(c) To the surviving spouse, if there is a child, the compensation payable under paragraph (b) of this section, and in addition thereto 10 percent of the monthly wage for each child, not to exceed a total of 50 percent of the monthly pay for such surviving spouse and children subject to the lump sum provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8135. If a child has a guardian other than the surviving spouse, the compensation payable on account of such child shall be paid to such guardian. The compensation entitlement of any child shall cease when he or she dies, marries or reaches the age of 18 years, or if over such age and incapable of self-support, becomes capable of self-support.</P>
              <P>(d) To the children, if there is no surviving spouse, 25 percent of the monthly pay for one child and 10 percent thereof for each additional child, not to exceed a total of 50 percent of the monthly pay thereof, divided among such children share and share alike subject to the lump sum provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8135. The compensation entitlement of each child shall cease when he or she dies, marries or reaches the age of 18, or if over such age and incapable of self-support, becomes capable of self-support. The compensation of a child under legal age shall be paid to its guardian, if there is one, otherwise to the person having the custody or care of such child, for such child, as the Director in his or her discretion shall determine.</P>

              <P>(e) To the parents, if one is wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee at the time of his or her death and the other is not dependent to any extent, 20 percent of the monthly pay; if both are wholly dependent, 10 percent thereof to each; if one is or both are partly dependent, a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Director. The compensation to a parent or parents in the percentages specified shall be paid if there is no surviving spouse or child, but if there is a surviving spouse or child, there shall be paid so much of such percentages for a parent or parents as, when added to the total of the percentages of the surviving spouse and children, will not exceed a total of 50 percent of the <PRTPAGE P="89"/>monthly pay. These payments are subject to the lump sum provision of 5 U.S.C. 8135.</P>
              <P>(f) To the brothers, sisters, grandparents and grandchildren, if one is wholly dependent upon the deceased employee for support at the time of his or her death, 20 percent of the monthly pay to such dependent; if more than one are wholly dependent, 30 percent of such pay, divided among such dependents share and share alike; if there is no one of them wholly dependent, but one or more are partly dependent, 10 percent of such pay divided among such dependents share and share alike. The compensation to such beneficiaries shall be paid if there is no surviving spouse, child or dependent parent. If there is a surviving spouse, child or dependent parent, there shall be paid so much of the above percentages as, when added to the total of the percentages payable to the surviving spouse, children and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 50 percent of such pay. These payments are subject to the lump sum provision of 5 U.S.C. 8135.</P>
              <P>(g) The compensation entitlement of each beneficiary under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section shall be paid until he or she, if a parent or grandparent, dies, marries or ceases to be dependent, or, if a brother, sister or grandchild, dies, marries or reaches the age of 18 years, or if over such age and incapable of self-support, becomes capable of self-support. The compensation of a brother, sister or grandchild under legal age shall be paid to his or her guardian, if there is one, otherwise to the person having the custody or care of such person, for such person, as the Director in his or her discretion shall determine.</P>
              <P>(h) Upon the cessation of any person's compensation for death under this subpart, the compensation of any remaining person entitled to continuing compensation in the same case shall remain the same so that the continuing compensation shall be at the same rate each person previously received.</P>
              <P>(i) In cases where there are two or more classes of persons entitled to compensation for death under this subpart, and the apportionment of such compensation as provided in this section would result in injustice, the Director may in his or her discretion modify the apportionments to meet the requirements of the case.</P>
              <P>(j) Compensation for death shall be paid where practicable in a lump sum pursuant to section 8135.</P>
              <P>(k) In the event a beneficiary eligible for death benefits covered under subpart B can demonstrate that the amount payable under the special schedule would result in a payment that would be demonstrably less than the amount payable under the law of his home country, the Director retains the discretion to pay that amount of compensation under 5 U.S.C. 8137(a)(2)(A), not to exceed the amount payable under FECA. To request benefits under this paragraph, the beneficiary must submit the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Translated copies of the applicable local statute as well as any regulations, policies and procedures the beneficiary asserts are applicable; and</P>
              <P>(2) A translated copy of an opinion rendered by an attorney licensed in that jurisdiction or an advisory opinion from a court or administrative tribunal that explains the benefits payable to the beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(l) A FECA death gratuity of $65,000 may be payable for the death of a non-citizen non-resident employee should the death be a result of injury incurred in connection with service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation as set forth in subpart J of part 10.</P>

                <P>Part B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, as amended (EEOICPA or Act), 42 U.S.C. 7384 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> provides for the payment of compensation benefits to covered Part B employees and, where applicable, survivors of such employees, of the United States Department of Energy (DOE), its predecessor agencies and certain of its contractors and subcontractors. Part B also provides for the payment of supplemental compensation benefits to other covered Part B employees who have already been found eligible for benefits under section 5 of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, as amended (RECA), 42 U.S.C. 2210 note, and where applicable, survivors of such persons. Part E of the Act provides for the payment of compensation benefits to covered Part E employees and, where applicable, survivors of such employees. The regulations in this part describe the rules governing filing, processing, and paying claims for benefits under both Part B and Part E of EEOICPA.</P>

                <P>(a) Part B of EEOICPA provides for the payment of either lump-sum monetary compensation for the disability of a covered Part B employee due to an occupational illness or for monitoring <PRTPAGE P="98"/>for beryllium sensitivity, as well as for medical and related benefits for such illness. Part B also provides for the payment of monetary compensation for the disability of a covered Part B employee to specified survivors if the employee is deceased at the time of payment.</P>
                <P>(b) Part E of EEOICPA provides for the payment of monetary compensation for the established wage-loss and/or impairment of a covered Part E employee due to a covered illness, and for medical and related benefits for such covered illness. Part E also provides for the payment of monetary compensation for the death (and established wage-loss, where applicable) of a covered Part E employee to specified survivors if the covered Part E employee is deceased at the time of payment.</P>
                <P>(c) All types of benefits and conditions of eligibility listed in this section are subject to the provisions of EEOICPA and this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What rules govern the administration of EEOICPA and this chapter?</SUBJECT>
                <P>In accordance with EEOICPA, Executive Order 13179 and Secretary's Order No. 10-2009, the primary responsibility for administering the Act, except for those activities assigned to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Secretary of Energy and the Attorney General, has been delegated to the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). Except as otherwise provided by law, the Director of OWCP and his or her designees have the exclusive authority to administer, interpret and enforce the provisions of the Act.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 30.2</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>In general, how have the tasks associated with the administration of EEOICPA claims process been assigned?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In E.O. 13179, the President assigned the tasks associated with administration of the EEOICPA claims process among the Secretaries of Labor, HHS and Energy, and the Attorney General. In light of the fact that the Secretary of Labor has been assigned primary responsibility for administering EEOICPA, almost the entire claims process is within the exclusive control of OWCP. This means that all claimants file their claims with OWCP, and OWCP is responsible for granting or denying compensation under the Act (see §§ 30.100 through 30.102). OWCP also provides assistance to claimants and potential claimants by providing information regarding eligibility and other program requirements, including information on completing claim forms and the types and availability of medical testing and diagnostic services related to occupational illnesses under Part B of the Act and covered illnesses under Part E of the Act. In addition, OWCP provides an administrative review process for claimants who disagree with its recommended and final adverse decisions on claims of entitlement (see §§ 30.300 through 30.320).</P>
                <P>(b) However, HHS has exclusive control of the portion of the claims process under which it provides reconstructed doses for certain radiogenic cancer claims (see § 30.115), which it delegated to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in 42 CFR part 82. HHS also has exclusive control of the process for designating classes of employees to be added to the Special Exposure Cohort under Part B of the Act, and has promulgated regulations governing that process at 42 CFR part 83. Finally, HHS has promulgated regulations at 42 CFR part 81 that set out guidelines that OWCP follows when it assesses the compensability of an employee's radiogenic cancer (see § 30.213). DOE and DOJ must, among other things, notify potential claimants and submit evidence that OWCP deems necessary for its adjudication of claims under EEOICPA (see §§ 30.105, 30.112, 30.206, 30.212 and 30.221).</P>

                <SUBJECT>In general, how does an employee file an initial claim for benefits?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) To claim benefits under EEOICPA, an employee must file a claim in writing with OWCP. Form EE-1 should be used for this purpose, but any written communication that requests benefits under EEOICPA will be considered a claim. It will, however, be necessary for an employee to submit a Form EE-1 for OWCP to fully develop the claim. Copies of Form EE-1 may be obtained from OWCP or on the internet at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/index.htm.</E> The employee must sign the written claim that is filed with OWCP, but another person may present the claim to OWCP on the employee's behalf.</P>

                <P>(b) The employee may choose, at his or her own option, to file for benefits for only certain conditions that are potentially compensable under the Act (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the employee may not want to claim for an occupational illness or a covered illness for which a payment <PRTPAGE P="105"/>has been received that would necessitate an offset of EEOICPA benefits under the provisions of § 30.505(b) of these regulations). The employee may withdraw his or her claim by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any time before OWCP determines his or her eligibility for benefits.</P>
                <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a claim is considered to be “filed” on the date that the employee mails his or her claim to OWCP, as determined by postmark or other carrier's date marking, or on the date that the claim is received by OWCP, whichever is the earliest determinable date. However, in no event will a claim under Part B of EEOICPA be considered to be “filed” earlier than July 31, 2001, nor will a claim under Part E of EEOICPA be considered to be “filed” earlier than October 30, 2000.</P>
                <P>(1) The employee shall affirm that the information provided on the Form EE-1 is true, and must inform OWCP of any subsequent changes to that information.</P>
                <P>(2) Except for a covered uranium employee filing a claim under Part B of the Act, the employee is responsible for submitting with his or her claim, or arranging for the submission of, medical evidence to OWCP that establishes that he or she sustained an occupational illness and/or a covered illness. This required medical evidence is described in § 30.114 and does not refer to mere recitations of symptoms the employee experienced that the employee believes indicate that he or she sustained an occupational illness or a covered illness.</P>
                <P>(d) For those claims under Part E of EEOICPA that were originally filed with DOE as claims for assistance under former section 7385o of EEOICPA (which was repealed on October 28, 2004), a claim is considered to be “filed” on the date that the employee mailed his or her claim to DOE, as determined by postmark or other carrier's date marking, or on the date that the claim was received by DOE, whichever is the earliest determinable date. However, in no event will a claim referred to in this paragraph be considered to be “filed” earlier than October 30, 2000.</P>

                <P>(a) A survivor of an employee must file a claim for compensation in writing with OWCP. Form EE-2 should be used for this purpose, but any written communication that requests survivor benefits under the Act will be considered a claim. It will, however, be necessary for a survivor to submit a Form EE-2 for OWCP to fully develop the claim. Copies of Form EE-2 may be obtained from OWCP or on the internet at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/index.htm.</E> The survivor must sign the written claim that is filed with OWCP, but another person may present the claim to OWCP on the survivor's behalf. Although only one survivor needs to file a claim under this section to initiate the development process, OWCP will distribute any monetary benefits payable on the claim among all eligible surviving beneficiaries who have filed claims with OWCP.</P>

                <P>(b) A survivor may choose, at his or her own option, to file for benefits for only certain conditions that are potentially compensable under the Act (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the survivor may not want to claim for an occupational illness or a covered illness for which a payment has been received that would necessitate an offset of EEOICPA benefits under the provisions of § 30.505(b) of these regulations). The survivor may withdraw his or her claim by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any time before OWCP determines his or her eligibility for benefits.</P>
                <P>(c) A survivor must be alive to receive any payment under EEOICPA; there is no vested right to such payment.</P>

                <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a survivor's claim is considered to be “filed” on the date that the survivor mails his or her claim to OWCP, as determined by postmark or other carrier's date marking, or the date that the claim is received by OWCP, whichever is the earliest determinable date. However, in no event will a survivor's claim under Part B of the Act be considered to be “filed” earlier than July 31, 2001, nor will a survivor's claim under Part E of the Act be considered to be “filed” earlier than October 30, 2000.<PRTPAGE P="106"/>

                <P>(1) The survivor shall affirm that the information provided on the Form EE-2 is true, and must inform OWCP of any subsequent changes to that information.</P>
                <P>(2) Except for the survivor of a covered uranium employee claiming under Part B of the Act, the survivor is responsible for submitting, or arranging for the submission of, evidence to OWCP that establishes that the employee upon whom the survivor's claim is based was eligible for such benefits, including medical evidence that establishes that the employee sustained an occupational illness or a covered illness. This required medical evidence is described in § 30.114 and does not refer to mere recitations by the survivor of symptoms the employee experienced that the survivor believes indicate that the employee sustained an occupational illness or a covered illness.</P>
                <P>(e) For those claims under Part E of EEOICPA that were originally filed with DOE as claims for assistance under former section 7385o of EEOICPA (which was repealed on October 28, 2004), a claim is considered to be “filed” on the date that the survivor mailed his or her claim to DOE, as determined by postmark or other carrier's date marking, or on the date that the claim was received by DOE, whichever is the earliest determinable date. However, in no event will a claim referred to in this paragraph be considered to be “filed” earlier than October 30, 2000.</P>
                <P>(f) A spouse or a child of a deceased DOE contractor employee or RECA section 5 uranium worker, who is not a covered spouse or covered child under Part E, may submit a written request to OWCP for a determination of whether that deceased DOE contractor employee or RECA section 5 uranium worker contracted a covered illness under section 7385s-4(d) of EEOICPA.</P>
                <P>(1) Any such request submitted pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section will not be considered a survivor's claim for benefits under Part E of the Act.</P>
                <P>(2) As part of its consideration of any request submitted pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, OWCP will apply the eligibility criteria in subpart C of this part. However, the adjudicatory procedures contained in subpart D of this part will not apply to OWCP's consideration of such a request, and OWCP's response to the request will not constitute a final agency decision on entitlement to any benefits under EEOICPA.</P>

                <P>(a) An employee previously awarded impairment benefits by OWCP may file a claim for additional impairment benefits. Such claim must be based on an increase in the employee's impairment rating attributable to the covered illness or illnesses from the impairment rating that formed the basis for the last award of such benefits by OWCP. OWCP will only adjudicate claims for such an increased rating that are filed at least two years from the date of the last award of impairment benefits. However, OWCP will not wait two years before it will adjudicate a claim for additional impairment that is based on an allegation that the employee sustained a new covered illness.</P>
                <P>(b) An employee previously awarded wage-loss benefits by OWCP may be eligible for additional wage-loss benefits for periods of wage-loss that were not addressed in a prior claim only if the employee had not reached his or her Social Security retirement age at the time of the prior award. OWCP will adjudicate claims filed on a yearly basis in connection with each succeeding calendar year for which qualifying wage-loss under Part E is alleged, as well as claims that aggregate calendar years for which qualifying wage-loss is alleged.</P>
                <P>(c) Employees should use Form EE-10 to claim for additional impairment or wage-loss benefits under Part E of EEOICPA.</P>
                <P>(1) The employee, or the person filing the claim on behalf of the employee, shall affirm that the information provided on Form EE-10 is true, and must inform OWCP of any subsequent changes to that information.</P>

                <P>(2) The employee is responsible for submitting with any claim filed under <PRTPAGE P="107"/>this section, or arranging for the submission of, factual and medical evidence establishing that he or she experienced another calendar year of qualifying wage-loss, and/or medical evidence establishing that he or she has an increased minimum impairment rating, as appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What must DOE do after an employee or survivor files a claim?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) After it receives a claim for benefits described in § 30.100 or § 30.101, OWCP may request that DOE verify the employment history provided by the claimant. Upon receipt of such a request, DOE will complete Form EE-5 as soon as possible and transmit the completed form to OWCP. On this form, DOE will certify either that it concurs with the employment history provided by the claimant, that it disagrees with such history, or that it can neither concur nor disagree after making a reasonable search of its records and also making a reasonable effort to locate pertinent records not already in its possession.</P>
                <P>(b) Claims for additional impairment or wage-loss benefits under Part E of the Act described in § 30.102 will not require any verification of employment by DOE, since OWCP will have made any required findings on this particular issue when it adjudicated the employee's initial claim for benefits.</P>

                <P>(a) For most claims filed under EEOICPA, DOE has access to sufficient factual information to enable it to fulfill its obligations described in § 30.105(a). However, in instances where it lacks such information, DOE may arrange for other entities to provide OWCP with the information necessary to verify an employment history submitted as part of a claim. These other entities may consist of either current or former DOE contractors and subcontractors, atomic weapons employers, beryllium vendors, or other entities with access to relevant employment information.</P>
                <P>(b) On its own initiative, OWCP may also arrange for entities other than DOE to perform the employment verification duties described in § 30.105(a).</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is the claimant's responsibility with respect to burden of proof, production of documents, presumptions, and affidavits?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Except where otherwise provided in the Act and these regulations, the claimant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of each and every criterion necessary to establish eligibility under any compensable claim category set forth in § 30.110. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the proposition to be proved is true. Subject to the exceptions expressly provided in the Act and the regulations in this part, the claimant also bears the burden of providing to OWCP all written medical documentation, contemporaneous records, or other records and documents necessary to establish any and all criteria for benefits set forth in these regulations.</P>
                <P>(b) In the event that the claim lacks required information or supporting documentation, OWCP will notify the claimant of the deficiencies and provide him or her an opportunity for correction of the deficiencies.</P>
                <P>(c) Written affidavits or declarations, subject to penalty for perjury, by the employee, survivor or any other person, will be accepted as evidence of employment history and survivor relationship for purposes of establishing eligibility and may be relied on in determining whether a claim meets the requirements of the Act for benefits if, and only if, such person attests that due diligence was used to obtain records in support of the claim, but that no records exist.</P>
                <P>(d) A claimant will not be entitled to any presumption otherwise provided for in these regulations if substantial evidence exists that rebuts the existence of the fact that is the subject of the presumption. Substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. When such evidence exists, the claimant shall be notified and afforded the opportunity to submit additional written medical documentation or records.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What kind of evidence is needed to establish covered employment and how will that evidence be evaluated?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Evidence of covered employment may include: employment records; pay stubs; tax returns; Social Security records; and written affidavits or declarations, subject to penalty of perjury, by the employee, survivor or any other person. However, no one document is required to establish covered employment and a claimant is not required to submit all of the evidence listed above. A claimant may submit other evidence not listed above to establish covered employment. To be acceptable as evidence, all documents and records must be legible. OWCP will accept photocopies, certified copies, and original documents and records.</P>
                <P>(b) Pursuant to §§ 30.105 and/or 30.106, DOE or another entity verifying alleged employment shall certify that it concurs with the employment information provided by the claimant, that it disagrees with the information provided by the claimant, or, after a reasonable search of its records and a reasonable effort to locate pertinent records not already in its possession, it can neither concur nor disagree with the information provided by the claimant.</P>
                <P>(1) If DOE or another entity certifies that it concurs with the employment information provided by the claimant, then the criterion for covered employment will be established.</P>

                <P>(2) If DOE or another entity certifies that it disagrees with the information provided by the claimant or that after a reasonable search of its records and a <PRTPAGE P="109"/>reasonable effort to locate pertinent records not already in its possession it can neither concur nor disagree with the information provided by the claimant, OWCP will evaluate the evidence submitted by the claimant to determine whether the claimant has established covered employment by a preponderance of the evidence. OWCP may request additional evidence from the claimant to demonstrate that the claimant has met the criterion for covered employment. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit OWCP's ability to require additional documentation.</P>
                <P>(3) If the only evidence of covered employment submitted by the claimant is a written affidavit or declaration subject to penalty of perjury by the employee, survivor or any other person, and DOE or another entity either disagrees with the assertion of covered employment or cannot concur or disagree with the assertion of covered employment, then OWCP will evaluate the probative value of the affidavit in conjunction with the other evidence of employment, and may determine that the claimant has not met his or her burden of proof under § 30.111.</P>

                <P>(a) All written medical documentation, contemporaneous records, and other records or documents submitted by an employee or his or her survivor to prove any criteria provided for in these regulations must be legible. OWCP will accept photocopies, certified copies, and original documents and records.</P>
                <P>(b) To establish eligibility, the employee or his or her survivor may be required to provide, where appropriate, additional contemporaneous records to the extent they exist or an authorization to release additional contemporaneous records or a statement by the custodian(s) of the record(s) certifying that the requested record(s) no longer exist. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit OWCP's ability to require additional documentation.</P>
                <P>(c) If a claimant submits a certified statement, by a person with knowledge of the facts, that the medical records containing a diagnosis and date of diagnosis of a covered medical condition no longer exist, then OWCP may consider other evidence to establish a diagnosis and date of diagnosis of a covered medical condition. However, OWCP will evaluate the probative value of such other evidence to determine whether it is sufficient proof of a covered medical condition.</P>

                <P>(3) For covered illnesses under Part E of EEOICPA, additional medical evidence, as set forth in § 30.232, is required to establish a covered illness.</P>

                <P>(i) For impairment benefits under Part E of EEOICPA, additional medical <PRTPAGE P="110"/>evidence, as set forth in § 30.901, is required to establish an impairment that is the result of a covered illness referred to in § 30.900.</P>
                <P>(ii) For wage-loss benefits under Part E of EEOICPA, additional medical evidence, as set forth in § 30.806, is required to establish wage-loss that is the result of a covered illness referred to in § 30.800.</P>
                <P>(4) For consequential injuries, illnesses, impairments or diseases, the claimant must also submit a physician's fully rationalized medical report showing a causal relationship between the resulting injury, illness, impairment or disease and the compensable medical condition.</P>
                <P>(c) OWCP will evaluate the medical evidence in accordance with recognized and accepted diagnostic criteria used by physicians to determine whether the claimant has established the medical condition for which compensation is sought in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</P>

                <SUBJECT>For those radiogenic cancer claims that do not seek benefits under Part B of the Act pursuant to the Special Exposure Cohort provisions, what will OWCP do once it determines that an employee contracted cancer?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Other than claims seeking benefits under Part E of the Act that have previously been accepted under section 7384u of the Act or claims previously accepted under Part B pursuant to the Special Exposure Cohort provisions, OWCP will forward the claim package (including, but not limited to, Forms EE-1, EE-2, EE-3, EE-4 and EE-5, as appropriate) to NIOSH for dose reconstruction. At that point in time, development of the claim by OWCP may be suspended.</P>
                <P>(1) This package will include OWCP's initial findings in regard to the diagnosis and date of diagnosis of the employee, as well as any employment history compiled by OWCP (including information such as dates and locations worked, and job titles). The package, however, will not constitute either a recommended or final decision by OWCP on the claim.</P>
                <P>(2) NIOSH will then reconstruct the radiation dose of the employee and provide the claimant and OWCP with the final dose reconstruction report. The final dose reconstruction record will be delivered to OWCP with the final dose reconstruction report and to the claimant upon request.</P>
                <P>(b) Following its receipt of the final dose reconstruction report from NIOSH, OWCP will resume its adjudication of the cancer claim and consider whether the claimant has met the eligibility criteria set forth in subpart C of this part. However, during the period before it receives a reconstructed dose from NIOSH, OWCP may continue to develop other aspects of a claim, to the extent that it deems such development to be appropriate.</P>

                <P>(a) The employee is a covered beryllium employee only if the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section, or (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, are established:</P>
                <P>(1) The employee is a “current or former employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8101(1)” (see § 30.5(u)) who may have been exposed to beryllium at a DOE facility or at a facility owned, operated or occupied by a beryllium vendor; or</P>
                <P>(2) The employee is a current or former civilian employee of:</P>
                <P>(i) Any entity that contracted with the DOE to provide management and operation, management and integration, or environmental remediation of a DOE facility; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Any contractor or subcontractor that provided services, including construction and maintenance, at such a facility; or</P>
                <P>(iii) A beryllium vendor, or of a contractor or subcontractor of a beryllium vendor, during a period when the vendor was engaged in activities related to the production or processing of beryllium for sale to, or use by, the DOE, including periods during which environmental remediation of a vendor's facility was undertaken pursuant to a contract between the vendor and DOE; and</P>
                <P>(3) The civilian employee was exposed to beryllium in the performance of duty by establishing that he or she was, during a period when beryllium dust, particles, or vapor may have been present at such a facility:</P>
                <P>(i) Employed at a DOE facility (as defined in § 30.5(y)); or</P>
                <P>(ii) Present at a DOE facility, or at a facility owned, operated, or occupied by a beryllium vendor, because of his or her employment by the United States, a beryllium vendor, a contractor or subcontractor of a beryllium vendor, or a contractor or subcontractor of the DOE. Under this paragraph, exposure to beryllium in the performance of duty can be established whether or not the beryllium that may have been present at such facility was produced or processed for sale to, or use by, DOE.</P>
                <P>(b) The employee has one of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Beryllium sensitivity as established by an abnormal beryllium LPT performed on either blood or lung lavage cells.</P>
                <P>(2) Established chronic beryllium disease.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does a claimant prove that the employee was a “covered beryllium employee” exposed to beryllium dust, particles or vapor in the performance of duty?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Proof of employment or physical presence at a DOE facility, or a beryllium vendor facility as defined in § 30.5(j), because of employment by the United States, a beryllium vendor, or a contractor or subcontractor of a beryllium vendor during a period when beryllium dust, particles or vapor may have been present at such facility, may be made by the submission of any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, establish that the employee was employed or present at a covered facility and the time period of such employment or presence.</P>
                <P>(b) If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed or present at a facility during a time frame that is outside the relevant time frame indicated for that facility, OWCP may request that DOE provide additional information on the facility. OWCP will determine whether the evidence of record supports enlarging the relevant time frame for that facility.</P>

                <P>(c) If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed or present at a facility that would have to be designated by DOE as a beryllium vendor under section 7384m <PRTPAGE P="112"/>of the Act to be a covered facility, and that the facility has not been so designated, OWCP will deny the claim on the ground that the facility is not a covered facility.</P>
                <P>(d) Records from the following sources may be considered as evidence for purposes of establishing employment or presence at a covered facility:</P>
                <P>(1) Records or documents created by any federal government agency (including verified information submitted for security clearance), any tribal government, or any state, county, city or local government office, agency, department, board or other entity, or other public agency or office.</P>
                <P>(2) Records or documents created by any vendor, processor, or producer of beryllium or related products designated as a beryllium vendor by the DOE in accordance with section 7384m of the Act.</P>
                <P>(3) Records or documents created as a by product of any regularly conducted business activity or by an entity that acted as a contractor or subcontractor to the DOE.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does a claimant prove a diagnosis of a beryllium disease covered under Part B?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Written medical documentation is required in all cases to prove that the employee developed a covered beryllium illness. Proof that the employee developed a covered beryllium illness must be made by using the procedures outlined in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) Beryllium sensitivity or sensitization is established with an abnormal LPT performed on either blood or lung lavage cells.</P>
                <P>(c) Chronic beryllium disease is established in the following manner:</P>
                <P>(1) For diagnoses on or after January 1, 1993, beryllium sensitivity (as established in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section), together with lung pathology consistent with chronic beryllium disease, including the following:</P>
                <P>(i) A lung biopsy showing granulomas or a lymphocytic process consistent with chronic beryllium disease;</P>
                <P>(ii) A computerized axial tomography scan showing changes consistent with chronic beryllium disease; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Pulmonary function or exercise testing showing pulmonary deficits consistent with chronic beryllium disease.</P>
                <P>(2) For diagnoses before January 1, 1993, the presence of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Occupational or environmental history, or epidemiologic evidence of beryllium exposure; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Any three of the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(A) Characteristic chest radiographic (or computed tomography (CT)) abnormalities.</P>
                <P>(B) Restrictive or obstructive lung physiology testing or diffusing lung capacity defect.</P>
                <P>(C) Lung pathology consistent with chronic beryllium disease.</P>
                <P>(D) Clinical course consistent with a chronic respiratory disorder.</P>
                <P>(E) Immunologic tests showing beryllium sensitivity (skin patch test or beryllium blood test preferred).</P>
                <P>(d) OWCP will use the criteria in either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section to establish that the employee developed chronic beryllium disease as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) If the earliest dated medical evidence shows that the employee was either treated for, tested positive for, or diagnosed with a chronic respiratory disorder before January 1, 1993, the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be used;</P>
                <P>(2) If the earliest dated medical evidence shows that the employee was either treated for, tested positive for, or diagnosed with a chronic respiratory disorder on or after January 1, 1993, the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be used; and</P>
                <P>(3) If the employee was treated for a chronic respiratory disorder before January 1, 1993 and medical evidence verifies that such treatment was performed before January 1, 1993, but the medical evidence is dated on or after January 1, 1993, the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be used.</P>

                <P>(e) An injury, illness, impairment or disability sustained as a consequence of beryllium sensitivity or established <PRTPAGE P="113"/>chronic beryllium disease must be established with a fully rationalized medical report by a physician that shows the relationship between the injury, illness, impairment or disability and the beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease. Neither the fact that the injury, illness, impairment or disability manifests itself after a diagnosis of beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease, nor the belief of the claimant that the injury, illness, impairment or disability was caused by the beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease, is sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.</P>

                <P>(a) Proof of employment by the DOE or a DOE contractor at a DOE facility, or by an atomic weapons employer at an atomic weapons employer facility, or at a RECA section 5 facility, may be made by the submission of any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, <PRTPAGE P="114"/>establish that the employee was so employed and the time period(s) of such employment.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed at a facility during a time frame that is outside the relevant period indicated for that facility, OWCP may request that DOE provide additional information on the facility. OWCP will determine whether the evidence of record supports enlarging the relevant period for that facility.</P>
                <P>(2) OWCP may choose not to request that DOE provide additional information on an atomic weapons employer facility that NIOSH reported had a potential for significant residual radiation contamination in its report dated October 2003 and titled “Report on Residual Radioactive and Beryllium Contamination at Atomic Weapons Employer Facilities and Beryllium Vendor Facilities,” or any update to that report, if the evidence referred to in paragraph (a) of this section establishes that the employee was employed at that facility during a period when NIOSH reported that it had a potential for significant residual radiation contamination.</P>
                <P>(c) If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed by an employer that would have to be designated by DOE as an atomic weapons employer under section 7384l(4) of the Act to be a covered employer, and that the employer has not been so designated, OWCP will deny the claim on the ground that the employer is not a covered atomic weapons employer.</P>
                <P>(d) Records from the following sources may be considered as evidence for purposes of establishing employment or presence at a covered facility:</P>
                <P>(1) Records or documents created by any federal government agency (including verified information submitted for security clearance), any tribal government, or any state, county, city or local government office, agency, department, board or other entity, or other public agency or office.</P>
                <P>(2) Records or documents created as a byproduct of any regularly conducted business activity or by an entity that acted as a contractor or subcontractor to the DOE.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does a claimant establish that the radiogenic cancer was at least as likely as not related to employment at the DOE facility, the atomic weapons employer facility, or the RECA section 5 facility?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) HHS, with the advice of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, has issued regulatory guidelines at 42 CFR part 81 that OWCP uses to determine whether radiogenic cancers claimed under Parts B and E were at least as likely as not related to employment at a DOE facility, an atomic weapons employer facility, or a RECA section 5 facility. Persons should consult HHS's regulations for information regarding the factual evidence that will be considered by OWCP, in addition to the employee's final dose reconstruction report that will be provided to OWCP by NIOSH, in making this particular factual determination.</P>

                <P>(b) HHS's regulations satisfy the legal requirements in section 7384n(c) of the Act, which also sets out OWCP's obligation to use them in its adjudication of claims for radiogenic cancer filed under Part B of the Act, and provide the factual basis for OWCP to determine if the “probability of causation” (PoC) that an employee's cancer was sustained in the performance of duty is 50% or greater (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, it is “at least as likely as not” causally related to employment), as required under section 7384n(b).</P>

                <P>(c) OWCP also uses HHS's regulations when it makes the determination required by section 7385s-4(c)(1)(A) of the Act, since those regulations provide the factual basis for OWCP to determine if “it is at least as likely as not” that exposure to radiation at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate, was a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the employee's radiogenic cancer claimed under Part E. For cancer claims under Part E, if the PoC is less than 50% and the claimant alleges that the employee was exposed to additional toxic substances, OWCP will determine <PRTPAGE P="115"/>if the claim is otherwise compensable pursuant to § 30.230(d) of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) For purposes of establishing eligibility as a member of the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) under § 30.210(a)(1), the employee must have been a DOE employee, a DOE contractor employee, or an atomic weapons employee who meets any of the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) The employee was so employed for a number of workdays aggregating at least 250 workdays before February 1, 1992, at a gaseous diffusion plant located in Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; or Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and during such employment:</P>
                <P>(i) Was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges for exposure at the plant of the external parts of the employee's body to radiation; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Worked in a job that had exposures comparable to a job that is or was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges.</P>
                <P>(2) The employee was so employed before January 1, 1974, by DOE or a DOE contractor or subcontractor on Amchitka Island, Alaska, and was exposed to ionizing radiation in the performance of duty related to the Long Shot, Milrow, or Cannikin underground nuclear tests.</P>
                <P>(3) The employee is a member of a group or class of employees subsequently designated as additional members of the SEC by HHS.</P>
                <P>(b) For purposes of satisfying the 250 workday requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the claimant may aggregate the days of service at more than one gaseous diffusion plant.</P>
                <P>(c) Proof of employment by the DOE or a DOE contractor, or an atomic weapons employer, for the requisite time periods set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may be made by the submission of any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, establish that the employee was so employed and the time period(s) of such employment. If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed by an employer that would have to be designated by DOE as an atomic weapons employer under section 7384l(4) of the Act to be a covered employer, and that the employer has not been so designated, OWCP will deny the claim on the ground that the employer is not a covered atomic weapons employer.</P>

                <P>(i) Has been diagnosed with an illness; and</P>

                <P>(iii) That it is at least as likely as not that the exposure to such toxic substance was related to employment at a Department of Energy facility or a RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(2) In making the determination under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, OWCP will consider:</P>

                <P>(ii) Evidence of the carcinogenic or pathogenic properties of the alleged toxic substance to which the employee was exposed;</P>
                <P>(iii) An opinion of a qualified physician with expertise in treating, diagnosing or researching the illness claimed to be caused or aggravated by the alleged exposure; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Any other evidence that OWCP determines to have demonstrated relevance to the relation between a particular toxic substance and the claimed illness.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How does a claimant prove employment-related exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility?</SUBJECT>
                <P>To establish employment-related exposure to a toxic substance at a Department of Energy facility or RECA section 5 facility as required by § 30.230(d), an employee, or his or her survivor(s), must prove that the employee was employed at such facility and that he or she was exposed to a toxic substance in the course of that employment.</P>
                <P>(a) Proof of employment may be established by any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, establish that the employee was so employed and the time period(s) of such employment. If the only evidence of covered employment submitted by the claimant is a written affidavit or declaration subject to penalty of perjury by the employee, survivor or any other person, and DOE or another entity either disagrees with the assertion of covered employment or cannot concur or disagree with the assertion of covered employment, then OWCP will evaluate the probative value of the affidavit in conjunction with the other evidence of employment, and may determine that the claimant has not met his or her burden of proof under § 30.111.</P>
                <P>(b) For claimants who have established proof of employment, proof of exposure to a toxic substance may be established by the submission of any appropriate document or information that is evidence that such substance was present at the facility where the employee was employed and that the employee came into contact with such substance. Information from the following sources may be considered as probative factual evidence for purposes of establishing an employee's exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility:</P>
                <P>(1) To the extent practicable and appropriate, from DOE, a DOE-sponsored Former Worker Program, or an entity that acted as a contractor or subcontractor to DOE;</P>
                <P>(2) OWCP's Site Exposure Matrices; or</P>
                <P>(3) Any other entity deemed by OWCP to be a reliable source of information necessary to establish that the employee was exposed to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility.</P>

                <P>(1) Written medical evidence containing a physician's diagnosis of the employee's covered illness (as that term is defined in § 30.5(s)), and the physician's reasoning for his or her opinion regarding causation; and<PRTPAGE P="119"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Any other evidence OWCP may deem necessary to show that the employee has or had an illness that resulted from an exposure to a toxic substance while working at either a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility.</P>
                <P>(b) An injury, illness, impairment or disease sustained as a consequence of a covered illness (as defined in § 30.5(s)) must be established with a fully rationalized medical report by a physician that shows the relationship between the injury, illness, impairment or disease and the covered illness. Neither the fact that the injury, illness, impairment or disease manifests itself after a diagnosis of a covered illness, nor the belief of the claimant that the injury, illness, impairment or disease was caused by the covered illness, is sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.</P>

                <P>OWCP district offices will issue recommended decisions with respect to most claims for entitlement under Part B and/or Part E of EEOICPA that are filed pursuant to the regulations set forth in subpart B of this part. In circumstances where a claim is made for more than one benefit available under Part B and/or Part E of the Act, OWCP may issue a recommended decision on only part of that particular claim in order to adjudicate that portion of the claim as quickly as possible. Should this occur, OWCP will issue one or more recommended decisions on the deferred portions of the claim when the adjudication of those portions is completed. All recommended decisions granting and/or denying claims for entitlement under Part B and/or Part E of the Act will be forwarded to the Final Adjudication Branch (FAB). Claimants will be given an opportunity to object to all or part of the recommended decision before the FAB. The FAB will consider objections filed by a claimant and conduct a hearing, if requested to do so by the claimant, before issuing a final decision on the claim for entitlement. Claimants may request judicial review of a final decision of FAB by filing an action in Federal district court.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May subpoenas be issued for witnesses and documents in connection with a claim under Part B of EEOICPA?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In connection with the adjudication of a claim under Part B of EEOICPA, an OWCP district office and/or a FAB reviewer may, at their own initiative, issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, electronic records, correspondence, papers or other relevant documents. Subpoenas will only be issued for documents if they are relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to ascertain the facts.</P>
                <P>(b) A claimant may also request a subpoena in connection with his or her claim under Part B of the Act, but such request may only be made to a FAB reviewer. No subpoenas will be issued at the request of the claimant under any other portion of the claims process. The decision to grant or deny such request is within the discretion of the FAB reviewer. To request a subpoena under this section, the requestor must:</P>
                <P>(1) Submit the request in writing and send it to the FAB reviewer as early as possible, but no later than 30 days (as evidenced by postmark or other carrier's date marking) after the date of the original hearing request;</P>
                <P>(2) Explain why the testimony or evidence is directly relevant and material to the issues in the case; and</P>
                <P>(3) Establish that a subpoena is the best method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there are no other means by which the documents or testimony could have been obtained.</P>

                <P>(c) No subpoena will be issued for attendance of employees or contractors of OWCP or NIOSH acting in their official capacities as decision-makers or policy administrators. For hearings <PRTPAGE P="120"/>taking the form of a review of the written record, no subpoena for the appearance of witnesses will be considered.</P>
                <P>(d) The FAB reviewer will issue the subpoena under his or her own name. It may be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the person to be served at his or her last known principal place of business or residence. A decision to deny a subpoena requested by a claimant can only be challenged as part of a request for reconsideration of any adverse decision of the FAB which results from the hearing.</P>

When this occurs, and at the request of OWCP, DOE and/or any contractor who employed a Department of Energy contractor employee must provide to OWCP information or documents in response to the request in connection with a claim under Part E of EEOICPA.</P>
                <P>(a) The party to whom the request is made must respond to OWCP within 90 days of the request with either:</P>
                <P>(1) The requested information or documents; or</P>
                <P>(2) A sworn statement that a good faith search for the requested information or documents was conducted, and that the information or documents could not be located.</P>
                <P>(b) DOE and/or the DOE contractor who employed a Department of Energy contractor employee must query third parties under its control to acquire the requested information or documents.</P>
                <P>(c) In providing the requested information or documents, DOE and/or the DOE contractor who employed a DOE contractor employee must preserve the current organization of the requested information or documents, and must provide such description and indexing of the requested information or documents as OWCP considers appropriate to facilitate their use by OWCP.</P>
                <P>(d) Information or document requests may include, but are not limited to, requests for records, files and other data, whether paper, electronic, imaged or otherwise, developed, acquired or maintained by DOE or the DOE contractor who employed a DOE contractor employee. Such information or documents may include records, files and data on facility industrial hygiene, employment of individuals or groups, exposure and medical records, and claims applications.</P>

At the discretion of the reviewer, the hearing may be conducted by telephone, teleconference, videoconference or other electronic means. As part of the hearing process, the FAB reviewer will consider the written record forwarded by the district office and any additional evidence and/or argument submitted by the claimant. The reviewer may also conduct whatever investigation is deemed necessary.</P>
                <P>(1) The FAB reviewer will try to set the hearing at a place that is within commuting distance of the claimant's residence, but will not be able to do so in all cases. Therefore, for reasons of economy, the claimant may be required to travel a roundtrip distance of up to 200 miles to attend the hearing.</P>
                <P>(2) In unusual circumstances, the FAB reviewer may set a place for the hearing that is more than 200 miles roundtrip from the claimant's residence. However, in that situation, OWCP will reimburse the claimant for reasonable and necessary travel expenses incurred to attend the hearing if he or she submits a written reimbursement request that documents such expenses.</P>
                <P>(b) The FAB reviewer will mail a notice of the time and place of the hearing to the claimant and any representative at least 30 days before the scheduled hearing date. The FAB reviewer may mail a hearing notice less than 30 days prior to the hearing if the claimant and/or representative waives the above 30-day notice period in writing. If the claimant only objects to part of the recommended decision, the FAB reviewer may issue a final decision accepting the remaining part of the recommendation of the district office without first holding a hearing (see § 30.316). Any objection that is not presented to the FAB reviewer, including any objection to NIOSH's reconstruction of the radiation dose to which the employee was exposed (if any), whether or not the pertinent issue was previously presented to the district office, is deemed waived for all purposes.</P>
                <P>(c) The hearing is an informal process, and the reviewer is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, or by technical or formal rules of procedure. The reviewer may conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. During the hearing process, the claimant may state his or her arguments and present new written evidence and/or testimony in support of the claim.</P>

                <P>(d) Testimony at hearings is recorded, then transcribed and placed in the record. Oral testimony shall be made under oath.<PRTPAGE P="123"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) The FAB reviewer will furnish a transcript of the hearing to the claimant, who has 20 days from the date it is sent to submit any comments to the reviewer.</P>
                <P>(f) The claimant will have 30 days after the hearing is held to submit additional evidence or argument, unless the reviewer, in his or her sole discretion, grants an extension. Only one such extension may be granted.</P>
                <P>(g) The reviewer determines the conduct of the hearing and may terminate the hearing at any time he or she determines that all relevant evidence has been obtained, or because of misbehavior on the part of the claimant and/or representative at or near the place of the oral presentation.</P>

Scheduling is at the discretion of the FAB, and is not reviewable. In most instances, once the hearing has been scheduled and appropriate written notice has been mailed, it cannot be postponed at the claimant's request for any reason except those stated in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the FAB reviewer can reschedule the hearing on the same docket (that is, during the same hearing trip). If a request to postpone a scheduled hearing does not meet one of the tests of paragraph (b) of this section and cannot be accommodated on the same docket, or if the claimant and/or representative cancels or fails to attend a scheduled hearing, no further opportunity for a hearing will be provided. Instead, the FAB will consider the claimant's objections by means of a review of the written record. In the alternative, a teleconference may be substituted for the hearing at the discretion of the reviewer.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the claimant or the representative appointed by the claimant in accordance with § 30.600 of this part has a medical reason that prevents attendance at the hearing, or where the death or illness of the claimant's parent, spouse, or child prevents the claimant from attending the hearing as scheduled, a postponement may be granted in the discretion of the FAB if the claimant or the representative provides at least 24 hours notice and a reasonable explanation supporting his or her inability to attend the scheduled hearing.</P>
                <P>(c) At any time after requesting a hearing, the claimant can request a change to a review of the written record by making a written request to the FAB. Once such a change is made, no further opportunity for a hearing will be provided.</P>

                <P>(a) If the claimant does not file a written statement that objects to the recommended decision and/or requests a hearing within the period of time allotted in § 30.310, or if the claimant waives any objections to all or part of the recommended decision, the FAB may issue a final decision accepting the recommendation of the district office, either in whole or in part (see §§ 30.311, 30.312 and 30.314(b)).</P>
                <P>(b) If the claimant objects to all or part of the recommended decision, the FAB reviewer will issue a final decision on the claim after either the hearing or the review of the written record, and after completing such further development of the case as he or she may deem necessary.</P>

                <P>(c) Any recommended decision (or part thereof) that is pending either a hearing or a review of the written record for more than one year from the date the FAB received the written statement described in § 30.310(a), or the date the Director reopened the claim for issuance of a new final decision pursuant to § 30.320(a), shall be considered a final decision of the FAB on the one-year anniversary of such date. Any recommended decision described in § 30.311 that is pending at the FAB for more than one year from the date that the period of time described in § 30.310 expired shall be considered a final decision of the FAB on the one-year anniversary of such date.<PRTPAGE P="124"/>

                <P>(a) If the claimant objects to NIOSH's reconstruction of the radiation dose to which the employee was exposed, either in writing or at the oral hearing, the FAB reviewer has the discretion to consult with NIOSH as part of his or her consideration of any objection. However, the HHS dose reconstruction regulation, which provides guidance for the technical methods developed and used by NIOSH to provide a reasonable estimate of the radiation dose received by an employee, is binding on FAB. Should this consultation take place, the FAB reviewer will properly document it in the case. Whether or not NIOSH is consulted, and as provided for in § 30.317, the FAB reviewer may decide to return the case to the district office for referral to NIOSH for such further action as may be appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) If the claimant objects to OWCP's calculation of the recommended probability of causation in a Part B radiogenic cancer claim, the FAB reviewer has the discretion to consider if OWCP used incorrect factual information when it performed this calculation. However, the statute requires that OWCP use a particular methodology, established by regulations issued by HHS at 42 CFR part 81, when it calculates the recommended probability of causation.</P>

                <P>(a) A claimant may request reconsideration of a final decision of the FAB by filing a written request with the FAB within 30 days from the date of issuance of such decision. If a timely request for reconsideration is made, the decision in question will no longer be considered “final” under § 30.316(d).</P>
                <P>(b) For purposes of determining whether the written request referred to in paragraph (a) of this section has been timely filed with the FAB, the request will be considered to be “filed” on the date that the claimant mails it to the FAB, as determined by postmark or other carrier's date marking, or on the date that such written request is actually received, whichever is the earliest determinable date.</P>
                <P>(c) A hearing is not available as part of the reconsideration process.

A new final decision that is issued after the FAB grants a request for reconsideration will be “final” upon the date of issuance of such new decision.</P>
                <P>(1) Instead of issuing a new final decision after granting a request for reconsideration, the FAB may return the claim to the district office for further development as provided in § 30.317.</P>
                <P>(2) If the FAB denies the request for reconsideration, the FAB decision that formed the basis for the request will be considered “final” upon the date the request is denied, and no further requests for reconsideration of that particular final decision of the FAB will be entertained.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Can a claim be reopened after the FAB has issued a final decision?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) At any time after the FAB has issued a final decision pursuant to § 30.316, and without regard to whether new evidence or information is presented or obtained, the Director for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation may reopen a claim and return it to the FAB for issuance of a new final decision, or to the district office for such further development as may be necessary, to be followed by a new recommended decision. The Director may also vacate any other type of decision issued by the FAB.</P>
                <P>(b) At any time after the FAB has issued a final decision pursuant to § 30.316, a claimant may file a written request that the Director for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation reopen his or her claim, provided that the claimant also submits new evidence of a diagnosed medical condition, covered employment, or exposure to a toxic substance. A written request to reopen a claim may also be supported by identifying either a change in the PoC guidelines, a change in the dose reconstruction methods or an addition of a class of employees to the Special Exposure Cohort. If the Director concludes that the evidence submitted or matter identified in support of the claimant's request is material to the claim, the Director will reopen the claim and return it to the district office for such further development as may be necessary, to be followed by a new recommended decision.</P>
                <P>(c) The decision whether or not to reopen a claim under this section is solely within the discretion of the Director for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation and is not reviewable. If the Director reopens a claim pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and returns it to the district office, the resulting new recommended decision will be subject to the adjudicatory process described in this subpart. However, neither the district office nor the FAB can consider any objection concerning the Director's decision to reopen a claim under this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the basic rules for obtaining medical treatment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A covered Part B employee or a covered Part E employee who fits into at least one of the compensable claim categories described in subpart C of this part is entitled to receive all medical services, appliances or supplies that a qualified physician prescribes or recommends and that OWCP considers necessary to treat his or her occupational illness or covered illness, retroactive to the date the claim for benefits for that occupational illness or covered illness under Part B or Part E of EEOICPA was filed. The employee need not be disabled to receive such treatment. If there is any doubt as to whether a specific service, appliance or supply is necessary to treat the occupational illness or covered illness, the employee should consult OWCP prior to obtaining it through the automated authorization process described in § 30.700. In situations where the occupational illness or covered illness is a secondary cancer, such treatment may include treatment of the underlying primary cancer when it is medically necessary or related to treatment of the secondary cancer; however, payment for medical treatment of the underlying primary cancer under these circumstances does not constitute a determination by OWCP that the primary cancer is a covered illness under Part E of EEOICPA.</P>

                <P>(b) If a claimant disagrees with the decision of OWCP that medical benefits provided under paragraph (a) of this section are not necessary to treat an <PRTPAGE P="126"/>occupational illness or covered illness, he or she may choose to utilize the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Any qualified physician may provide medical services, appliances and supplies to the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee. A hospital or a provider of medical services or supplies may furnish appropriate services, drugs, supplies and appliances, so long as such provider possesses all applicable licenses required under State law and has not been excluded from participation in the program under subpart H of this part. OWCP may apply a test of cost-effectiveness when it decides if appliances and supplies are necessary to treat an occupational illness or covered illness, may offset the cost of prior rental payments against a future purchase price, and may provide refurbished appliances where appropriate. Also, OWCP may authorize payment for durable medical equipment and modifications to a home or vehicle, to the extent that OWCP deems it necessary and reasonable. With respect to prescribed medications, OWCP may require the use of generic equivalents where they are available. OWCP may contract with a specific provider or providers to supply non-physician medical services or supplies.</P>
                <P>(d) In circumstances when a covered employee dies after filing a claim but before such claim is accepted, OWCP will pay for medical treatment for all accepted illnesses, retroactive to the date that the employee filed the claim, if the deceased employee's survivor(s) files a claim that is accepted under Part B and/or Part E of EEOICPA. If this occurs, OWCP shall only pay either the provider(s) or the employee's estate for medical treatment that the employee obtained after filing his or her claim.</P>

                <P>(b) A diagnosis of spinal subluxation as demonstrated by x-ray to exist must appear in the chiropractor's report before OWCP can consider payment of a chiropractor's bill.</P>
                <P>(c) A chiropractor may interpret his or her x-rays to the same extent as any other physician. To be given any weight, the medical report must state that x-rays support the finding of spinal subluxation. OWCP will not necessarily require submission of the x-ray, or a report of the x-ray, but the report must be available for submission on request.</P>

Therefore, a clinical psychologist may not serve as a physician for conditions that include a physical component unless the applicable state law allows clinical psychologists to treat physical conditions.

                <SUBJECT>Will OWCP pay for home health care, nursing home, and assisted living services?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) OWCP will authorize and pay for home health care claimed under section 7384t of the Act, whether or not such care constitutes skilled nursing care, so long as the care has been determined to be medically necessary. OWCP will pay for approved periods of care by a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, home health aide or similarly trained individual, subject to the pre-authorization requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

                <P>(b) OWCP will also authorize and pay for periods of nursing home and assisted living services claimed under section 7384t of the Act, so long as such services have been determined to be <PRTPAGE P="127"/>medically necessary, subject to the pre-authorization requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) To file an initial claim for home health care, nursing home, or assisted living services, the beneficiary must submit Form EE-17A to OWCP and identify his or her treating physician. OWCP then provides the treating physician with Form EE-17B, which asks the physician to submit a letter of medical necessity and verify that a timely face-to-face physical examination of the beneficiary took place. This particular pre-authorization process must be followed only for the initial claim for home health care, nursing home, and assisted living services; any subsequent request for pre-authorization must satisfy OWCP's usual medical necessity requirements. If a claimant disagrees with the decision of OWCP that the claimed services are not medically necessary, he or she may utilize the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Any qualified physician may provide medical services, appliances and supplies to the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee. A hospital or a provider of medical services or supplies may furnish appropriate services, drugs, supplies and appliances, so long as such provider possesses all applicable licenses required under State law and has not been excluded from participation in the program under subpart H of this part. OWCP may apply a test of cost-effectiveness when it decides if appliances and supplies are necessary to treat an occupational illness or covered illness, may offset the cost of prior rental payments against a future purchase price, and may provide refurbished appliances where appropriate.

                <P>(a) The employee is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses, including transportation, incident to obtaining authorized medical services, appliances or supplies. To determine what is a reasonable distance to travel, OWCP will consider the availability of services, the employee's condition, and the means of transportation. Generally, a roundtrip distance of up to 200 miles is considered a reasonable distance to travel.</P>
                <P>(b) If travel of more than 200 miles is contemplated, or air transportation or overnight accommodations will be needed, the employee must submit a written request to OWCP for prior authorization with information describing the circumstances and necessity for such travel expenses. OWCP will approve the request if it determines that the travel expenses are reasonable and necessary, and are incident to obtaining authorized medical services, appliances or supplies. Requests for travel expenses that are often approved include those resulting from referrals to a specialist for further medical treatment, and those involving air transportation of an employee who lives in a remote geographical area with limited local medical services.</P>
                <P>(c) If a claimant disagrees with the decision of OWCP that requested travel expenses are either not reasonable or necessary, or are not incident to obtaining authorized medical services, appliances or supplies, he or she may utilize the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</P>

                <P>(d) The standard form designated for medical travel refund requests is Form <PRTPAGE P="128"/>OWCP-957 and must be used to seek reimbursement under this section. This form can be obtained from OWCP.</P>

                <P>(a) OWCP will provide the employee with an opportunity to designate a treating physician when it accepts the claim. When the physician originally selected to provide treatment for an occupational illness or a covered illness refers the employee to a specialist for further medical care, the employee need not consult OWCP for approval. In all other instances, however, the employee must submit a written request to OWCP with his or her reasons for desiring a change of physician.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP will approve the request if it determines that the reasons submitted are credible and supported by probative factual and/or medical evidence, as appropriate. Requests that are often approved include those for transfer of care from a general practitioner to a physician who specializes in treating the occupational illnesses or covered illnesses covered by EEOICPA, or the need for a new physician when an employee has moved.</P>
                <P>(c) OWCP may deny a requested change of physician if it determines that the reasons submitted are not both credible and supported by probative evidence. If a claimant disagrees with such an informal denial, he or she may utilize the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) OWCP sometimes needs a second opinion from a medical specialist. The employee must submit to examination by a qualified physician who conforms to the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP as often and at such times and places as OWCP considers reasonably necessary. Also, OWCP may send a case file for second opinion review to a qualified physician who conforms to the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP where an actual examination is not needed, or where the employee is deceased.</P>
                <P>(b) If the initial examination is disrupted by someone accompanying the employee, OWCP will schedule another examination with a different qualified physician who conforms to the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP. The employee will not be entitled to have anyone else present at the subsequent examination unless OWCP decides that exceptional circumstances exist. For example, where a hearing-impaired employee needs an interpreter, the presence of an interpreter would be allowed.</P>
                <P>(c) OWCP may administratively close the claim and suspend adjudication of any pending matters if the employee refuses to attend a second opinion examination.</P>

                <P>(a) If one medical opinion holds more probative value than the other, OWCP will base its determination of coverage on the medical opinion with the greatest probative value. A difference in medical opinion sufficient to be considered a conflict only occurs when two reports of virtually equal weight and rationale reach opposing conclusions.</P>

                <P>(b) If a conflict exists between the medical opinion of the employee's physician and the medical opinion of a second opinion physician, an OWCP medical adviser or consultant, or a physician submitting an impairment evaluation that meets the criteria set out in § 30.905 of this part, OWCP shall appoint a third physician who conforms to the <PRTPAGE P="129"/>standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP to make an examination or an impairment evaluation. This is called a referee examination or a referee impairment evaluation. OWCP will select a physician who is qualified in the appropriate specialty and who has had no prior connection with the case. Also, a case file may be sent to a physician who conforms to the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP for a referee medical review where there is no need for an actual examination, or where the employee is deceased.</P>
                <P>(c) If the initial referee examination or referee impairment evaluation is disrupted by someone accompanying the employee, OWCP will schedule another examination or impairment evaluation with a different qualified physician who conforms to the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP. The employee will not be entitled to have anyone else present at the subsequent referee examination or referee impairment evaluation unless OWCP decides that exceptional circumstances exist. For example, where a hearing-impaired employee needs an interpreter, the presence of an interpreter would be allowed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for medical reports?</SUBJECT>
                <P>In general, medical reports from the employee's attending physician should include the following:</P>

                <P>(a) The initial medical report (and any subsequent reports) should be made in narrative form on the physician's letterhead stationery. The physician should use the Form EE-7 as a guide for the preparation of his or her initial medical report in support of a claim under Part B and/or Part E of EEOICPA. The report should bear the physician's handwritten or electronic signature. OWCP may require an original signature on the report.</P>
                <P>(b) The report shall be submitted directly to OWCP as soon as possible after medical examination or treatment is received, either by the employee or the physician.</P>

                <P>Usually, medical providers submit their bills directly for processing. The rules for submitting and processing provider bills and reimbursement requests are stated in subpart H of this part. An employee requesting reimbursement for out-of-pocket medical expenses must submit a Form OWCP-915 and meet the requirements described in § 30.702.</P>

                <P>To be considered for payment, bills and reimbursement requests must be submitted by the end of the calendar year after the year when the expense was incurred, or by the end of the calendar year after the year when OWCP first accepted the claim as compensable under subpart D of this part, whichever is later.</P>

                <P>(a) The OWCP fee schedule sets maximum limits on the amounts payable for many services. The employee may be only partially reimbursed for out-of-pocket medical expenses because the amount he or she paid to the medical provider for a service exceeds the maximum allowable charge set by the OWCP fee schedule.</P>
                <P>(b) If this happens, the employee will be advised of the maximum allowable charge for the service in question and of his or her responsibility to ask the provider to refund to the employee, or credit to the employee's account, the amount he or she paid that exceeds the maximum allowable charge. The provider that the employee paid, but not the employee, may request reconsideration of the fee determination as set forth in § 30.712.</P>
                <P>(c) If the provider does not refund to the employee or credit to his or her account the amount of money paid in excess of the charge that OWCP allows, the employee should submit documentation of the attempt to obtain such refund or credit to OWCP. OWCP may authorize reasonable reimbursement to the employee after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Surviving spouse</E> means the wife or husband of a deceased covered Part B employee or deceased covered Part E employee who was married to that individual for the 365 consecutive days immediately prior to the death of that individual.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Child</E> of a deceased covered Part B employee or deceased covered Part E employee means only a biological child, a stepchild or an adopted child of that individual.</P>
                <P>(b) For the purposes of paying compensation to survivors only under Part B of EEOICPA, OWCP will use the following additional definitions:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Parent</E> includes fathers and mothers of a deceased covered Part B employee through adoption.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Grandchild</E> means a child of a child of a deceased covered Part B employee.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Grandparent</E> means a parent of a parent of a deceased covered Part B employee.</P>
                <P>(c) For the purposes of paying compensation to survivors under Part E of EEOICPA, OWCP will use the following additional definitions:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Covered child</E> means a child that is, as of the date of the deceased covered Part E employee's death, either under the age of 18 years, or under the age of 23 years and a full-time student who was continuously enrolled in one or more educational institutions since attaining the age of 18 years, or any age and incapable of self-support. A child's marital status or dependency on <PRTPAGE P="131"/>the covered employee for support is irrelevant to his or her eligibility for benefits as a covered child under Part E.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Incapable of self-support</E> means that the child must have been physically and/or mentally incapable of self-support at the time of the covered employee's death.</P>

                <P>(a) Under Part B of the Act, if OWCP determines that a survivor or survivors are entitled to receive compensation under EEOICPA because a covered Part B employee who would otherwise have been entitled to benefits is deceased, that compensation will be disbursed as follows, subject to the qualifications set forth in § 30.5(hh)(3):</P>
                <P>(1) If there is a surviving spouse, the compensation shall be paid to that individual.</P>
                <P>(2) If there is no surviving spouse, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to all children of the deceased covered Part B employee.</P>
                <P>(3) If there is no surviving spouse and no children, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to the parents of the deceased covered Part B employee.</P>
                <P>(4) If there is no surviving spouse, no children and no parents, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to all grandchildren of the deceased covered Part B employee.</P>
                <P>(5) If there is no surviving spouse, no children, no parents and no grandchildren, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to the grandparents of the deceased covered Part B employee.</P>
                <P>(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, if there is a surviving spouse and at least one child of the deceased covered Part B employee who is a minor at the time of payment and who is not a recognized natural child or adopted child of such surviving spouse, half of the compensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse, and the other half of the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to each child of the deceased covered Part B employee who is a minor at the time of payment.</P>
                <P>(b) Under Part E of the Act, if OWCP determines that a survivor or survivors are entitled to receive compensation under EEOICPA because a covered Part E employee who would otherwise have been entitled to benefits is deceased, that compensation will be disbursed as follows, subject to the qualifications set forth in § 30.5(hh)(3):</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 30.505</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>What procedures will OWCP follow before it pays any compensation?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In cases involving the approval of a claim, whether in whole or in part, OWCP shall take all necessary steps to determine the amount of any offset or coordination of EEOICPA benefits before paying any benefits, and to verify the identity of the covered Part B employee, the covered Part E employee, or the eligible surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. To perform these tasks, OWCP may conduct any investigation, require any claimant to provide or execute any affidavit, record or document, or authorize the release of any information as OWCP deems necessary to ensure that the compensation payment is made in the correct amount and to the correct person or persons. OWCP shall also require every claimant under Part B of the Act to execute and provide any necessary affidavit described in § 30.620 of these regulations. Should a claimant fail or refuse to execute an affidavit or release of information, or fail or refuse to provide a requested document or record or to provide access to information, such failure or refusal may be deemed to be a rejection of the payment, unless the claimant does not have and cannot obtain the legal authority to provide, release, or authorize access to the required information, records, or documents.</P>

                <P>(b) To determine the amount of any offset, OWCP shall require the covered Part B employee, covered Part E employee or each eligible surviving beneficiary filing a claim under this part to execute and provide an affidavit (or declaration made under oath on Form EE-1 or EE-2) reporting the amount of any payment made pursuant to a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages. Even if someone other than the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee receives a payment pursuant to a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the surviving spouse of a deceased covered Part B employee or a deceased covered Part E employee), the receipt of any such payment must be reported.</P>

                <P>(1) For the purposes of this paragraph (b) only, “litigation seeking damages” refers to any request or demand for money (other than for workers' compensation) by the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee, or by another individual if the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee is deceased, made or sought in a civil action or in anticipation of the filing of a civil action, for injuries incurred on account of an exposure for which compensation is payable under EEOICPA. This term does not also include any request or demand for money made or sought pursuant to a life insurance or health insurance contract, or any request or demand for money made or sought by an individual other than the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee in that individual's own right (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, a spouse's claim for loss of consortium), or any request or demand for money made or sought by the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee (or the estate of a deceased covered Part B employee or deceased covered Part E employee) not for injuries incurred on account of an exposure for which compensation is payable under the EEOICPA (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, a covered Part B employee's or a covered Part E employee's claim for damage to real or personal property).</P>
                <P>(2) If a payment has been made pursuant to a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages, OWCP shall subtract a portion of the dollar amount of such payment from the benefit payments to be made under EEOICPA. OWCP will calculate the amount to be subtracted from the benefit payments in the following manner:</P>

                <P>(i) OWCP will first determine the value of the payment made pursuant to either a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages by adding the dollar amount of any monetary damages (excluding contingent awards) and any medical expenses for treatment provided on or after the date the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee filed a claim for EEOICPA benefits that were paid for under the final judgment or settlement. In the event that these payments include a “structured” settlement (where a party makes an initial <PRTPAGE P="133"/>cash payment and also arranges, usually through the purchase of an annuity, for payments in the future), OWCP will usually accept the cost of the annuity to the purchaser as the dollar amount of the right to receive the future payments.</P>
                <P>(ii) OWCP will then make certain deductions from the above dollar amount to arrive at the dollar amount to be subtracted from any unpaid EEOICPA benefits. Allowable deductions consist of attorney's fees OWCP deems reasonable, and itemized costs of suit (out-of-pocket expenditures not part of the normal overhead of a law firm's operation like filing fees, travel expenses, witness fees, and court reporter costs for transcripts) provided that adequate supporting documentation is submitted to OWCP.</P>
                <P>(iii) The EEOICPA benefits that will be reduced will consist of any unpaid lump-sum payments payable in the future and medical benefits payable in the future. In those cases where it has not yet paid EEOICPA benefits, OWCP will reduce such benefits on a dollar-for-dollar basis, beginning with the lump-sum payments first. If the amount to be subtracted exceeds the lump-sum payments, OWCP will reduce ongoing EEOICPA medical benefits payable in the future by the amount of any remaining surplus. This means that OWCP will apply the amount it would otherwise pay to reimburse the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee for any ongoing EEOICPA medical treatment to the remaining surplus until it is absorbed. In addition to this reduction of ongoing EEOICPA medical benefits, OWCP will not be the first payer for any medical expenses that are the responsibility of another party (who will instead be the first payer) as part of a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages.</P>
                <P>(3) The above reduction of EEOICPA benefits will not occur if an EEOICPA claimant had his or her award under section 5 of RECA reduced by the full amount of the payment made pursuant to a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages. It will also not occur if an EEOICPA claimant's prior payment of EEOICPA benefits, or his or her workers' compensation benefits, were offset to reflect the full amount of the payment made pursuant to a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages. However, if the prior reduction or offset of the above benefits did not reflect the full amount of the payment made pursuant to a final judgment or settlement in litigation seeking damages, OWCP will reduce currently payable EEOICPA benefits by the amount of any surplus final judgment or settlement payment that remains.</P>
                <P>(c) Except as provided in § 30.506(b) of these regulations, when OWCP has verified the identity of every claimant who is entitled to the compensation payment, or to a share of the compensation payment, and has determined the correct amount of the payment or the share of the payment, OWCP shall notify every claimant, every duly appointed guardian or conservator of a claimant, or every person with power of attorney for a claimant, and require such person or persons to complete a Form EN-20 providing payment information. Such form shall be signed and returned to OWCP within sixty days of the date of the form or within such greater period as may be allowed by OWCP. Failure to sign and return the form within the required time may be deemed to be a rejection of the payment. If the claimant dies before the payment is received, the person who receives the payment shall return it to OWCP for redetermination of the correct disbursement of the payment. No payment shall be made until OWCP has made a determination concerning the survivors related to a respective claim for benefits.</P>
                <P>(d) The total amount of compensation (other than medical benefits) under Part E that can be paid to all claimants as a result of the exposure of a covered Part E employee shall not be more than $250,000 in any circumstances.</P>

                <P>(a) Except with respect to claims under Part B of the Act for beryllium sensitivity, payment shall be made to the covered Part B employee or the covered Part E employee, to the duly appointed guardian or conservator of <PRTPAGE P="134"/>that individual, or to the person with power of attorney for that individual, unless the covered Part B employee or covered Part E employee is deceased at the time of the payment. In all cases involving a deceased covered Part B employee or deceased covered Part E employee, payment shall be made to the eligible surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries, to the duly appointed guardian or conservator of the eligible surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to every person with power of attorney for an eligible surviving beneficiary, in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in sections 7384s(e), 7384u(e), and 7385s-3(c) and (d) of EEOICPA.</P>
                <P>(b) Under Part B of the Act, compensation for any consequential injury, illness, impairment or disease is limited to payment of medical benefits for that injury, illness, impairment or disease. Under Part E of the Act, compensation for any consequential injury, illness, impairment or disease consists of medical benefits for that injury, illness, impairment or disease, as well as any additional monetary benefits that are consistent with the terms of § 30.505(d).</P>
                <P>(c) Rejected compensation payments, or shares of compensation payments, shall not be distributed to other eligible surviving beneficiaries, but shall be returned to the Fund.</P>
                <P>(d) No covered Part B employee may receive more than one lump-sum payment under Part B of EEOICPA for any occupational illnesses he or she contracted. However, any individual, including a covered Part B employee who has received a lump-sum payment for his or her own occupational illness or illnesses, may receive one lump-sum payment for each deceased covered Part B employee for whom he or she qualifies as an eligible surviving beneficiary under Part B of the Act.</P>

                <P>Beryllium sensitivity monitoring shall consist of medical examinations to confirm and monitor the extent and nature of a covered Part B employee's beryllium sensitivity.

                <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances may a survivor claiming under Part E of the Act choose to receive the benefits that would otherwise be payable to a covered Part E employee who is deceased?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If a covered Part E employee dies after filing a claim but before monetary benefits are paid under Part E of the Act, and his or her death is from a cause other than a covered illness, his or her survivor can choose to receive either the survivor benefits payable on account of the death of that covered Part E employee, or the monetary benefits that would otherwise have been payable to the covered Part E employee.</P>

                <P>(b) For the purposes of this section only, a death “from a cause other than a covered illness” refers only to a death that was <E T="03">solely</E> caused by a non-covered illness or illnesses. Therefore, the choice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will not be available if a covered illness contributed to the death of the covered Part E employee in any manner. In those instances, survivor benefits will still be payable to the claimant, but he or she cannot choose to receive the monetary benefits that would have otherwise been payable to the deceased covered Part E employee in lieu of survivor benefits.</P>

                <P>(c) OWCP only makes impairment determinations based on rationalized medical evidence in the case file that is <PRTPAGE P="135"/>sufficiently detailed and meets the various requirements for the many different types of impairment determinations possible under the American Medical Association's <E T="03">Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment</E> (AMA's <E T="03">Guides</E>). Therefore, OWCP will only make an impairment determination for a deceased covered Part E employee pursuant to this section if the medical evidence of record is sufficient to satisfy the pertinent requirements in the AMA's <E T="03">Guides</E> and subpart J of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) In addition to providing narrative descriptions to recipients of benefits paid or payable, OWCP includes on each check a clear indication of the reason the payment is being made. For payments sent by electronic funds transfer, a notification of the date and amount of payment appears on the statement from the recipient's financial institution.</P>
                <P>(b) By these means, OWCP puts the recipient on notice that a payment was made and the amount of the payment. If the amount received differs from the amount indicated on the written notice or bank statement, the recipient is responsible for notifying OWCP of the difference. Absent affirmative evidence to the contrary, the recipient will be presumed to have received the notice of payment, whether mailed or transmitted electronically.</P>

                <P>Before seeking to recover an overpayment or adjust benefits, OWCP will advise the recipient of the overpayment in writing that:</P>
                <P>(a) The overpayment exists, and the amount of overpayment;</P>
                <P>(b) A preliminary finding shows either that the recipient was or was not at fault in the creation of the overpayment;</P>
                <P>(c) He or she has the right to inspect and copy OWCP records relating to the overpayment; and</P>
                <P>(d) He or she has the right to present written evidence which challenges the fact or amount of the overpayment, and/or challenges the preliminary finding that he or she was at fault in the creation of the overpayment. He or she may also request that recovery of the overpayment be waived. Any submission of evidence or request that recovery of the overpayment be waived must be presented to OWCP within 30 days of the date of the written notice of overpayment.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances may OWCP waive recovery of an overpayment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) OWCP may consider waiving recovery of an overpayment only if the recipient was not at fault in accepting or creating the overpayment. Recipients of benefits paid under EEOICPA are responsible for taking all reasonable measures to ensure that payments received from OWCP are proper. The recipient must show good faith and exercise a high degree of care in reporting events which may affect entitlement to or the amount of benefits. A recipient who has done any of the following will be found to be at fault with respect to creating an overpayment:</P>
                <P>(1) Made an incorrect statement as to a material fact which he or she knew or should have known to be incorrect; or</P>
                <P>(2) Failed to provide information which he or she knew or should have known to be material; or</P>

                <P>(3) Accepted a payment which he or she knew or should have known to be incorrect. (This provision applies only to the overpaid individual.)<PRTPAGE P="136"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Whether or not OWCP determines that a recipient was at fault with respect to the creation of an overpayment depends on the circumstances surrounding the overpayment. The degree of care expected may vary with the complexity of those circumstances and the recipient's capacity to realize that he or she is being overpaid.</P>

                <P>If OWCP finds that the recipient of an overpayment was not at fault, repayment will still be required unless:</P>
                <P>(a) Adjustment or recovery of the overpayment would defeat the purpose of the Act (see § 30.516); or</P>
                <P>(b) Adjustment or recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience (see § 30.517).</P>

                <P>(a) The fact that OWCP may have erred in making the overpayment does not by itself relieve the recipient of the overpayment from liability for repayment if the recipient also was at fault in accepting the overpayment.</P>
                <P>(b) However, OWCP may find that the recipient was not at fault if failure to report an event affecting compensation benefits, or acceptance of an incorrect payment, occurred because:</P>
                <P>(1) The recipient relied on misinformation given in writing by OWCP regarding the interpretation of a pertinent provision or EEOICPA of this part; or</P>
                <P>(2) OWCP erred in calculating either the percentage of impairment or wage-loss under Part E of EEOICPA.</P>

                <P>(a) The recipient from whom OWCP seeks recovery needs substantially all of his or her current income to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses; and</P>
                <P>(b) The recipient's assets do not exceed two months' expenditures as determined by OWCP using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey tables.</P>

                <P>(a) Recovery of an overpayment is considered to be against equity and good conscience when the recipient would experience severe financial hardship in attempting to repay the debt.</P>
                <P>(b) Recovery of an overpayment is also considered to be against equity and good conscience when the recipient, in reliance on such payments or on notice that such payments would be made, gives up a valuable right or changes his or her position for the worse. In making such a decision, OWCP does not consider the recipient's current ability to repay the overpayment.</P>
                <P>(1) To establish that a valuable right has been relinquished, it must be shown that the right was in fact valuable, that it cannot be regained, and that the action was based chiefly or solely in reliance on the payments or on the notice of payment. Gratuitous transfers of funds to other individuals are not considered relinquishments of valuable rights.</P>
                <P>(2) To establish that a recipient's position has changed for the worse, it must be shown that the decision made would not otherwise have been made but for the receipt of benefits, and that this decision resulted in a loss.</P>

                <P>(a) The recipient of the overpayment is responsible for providing information about income, expenses and assets as specified by OWCP. This information is needed to determine whether or not recovery of an overpayment would defeat the purpose of the Act, or would be against equity and good conscience. This information will also be used to determine the repayment schedule, if necessary.</P>

OWCP will send a copy of the final decision to the individual from whom recovery is sought and his or her representative, if any.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How are overpayments collected?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When an overpayment has been made to a recipient who is entitled to further payments, the recipient shall refund to OWCP the amount of the overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her attention is called to same. If no refund is made, OWCP shall recover the overpayment by reducing any further lump-sum payments due currently or in the future, taking into account the financial circumstances of the recipient, and any other relevant factors, so as to minimize any hardship. Should the recipient die before collection has been completed, further collection shall be made by decreasing later payments, if any, payable under EEOICPA with respect to the underlying occupational illness or covered illness.</P>

                <P>(b) When an overpayment has been made to a recipient and OWCP is unable to recover the overpayment by reducing compensation due currently, the recipient shall refund to OWCP the amount of the overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her attention is called to same. The overpayment is subject to the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and may be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as income. If the recipient fails to make such refund, OWCP may recover the overpayment through any available means, including offset of salary, annuity benefits, or other Federal payments, including tax refunds as authorized by the Tax Refund Offset Program, or referral of the debt to a collection agency or to the Department of Justice.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May a claimant designate a representative?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The claims process under this part is informal, and OWCP acts as an impartial evaluator of the evidence. A claimant need not be represented to file a claim or receive a payment. Nevertheless, a claimant may appoint one individual to represent his or her interests, but the appointment must be in writing.</P>
                <P>(b) There can be only one representative at any one time, so after one representative has been properly appointed, OWCP will not recognize another individual as a representative until the claimant withdraws the authorization of the first individual. In addition, OWCP will recognize only certain types of individuals (see § 30.601). For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a “representative” does not include a person who only has a power of attorney to act on behalf of a claimant.</P>
                <P>(c) A properly appointed representative who is recognized by OWCP may make a request or give direction to OWCP regarding the claims process, including a hearing. This authority includes presenting or eliciting evidence, making arguments on facts or the law, and obtaining information from the case file, to the same extent as the claimant.</P>
                <P>(1) Any notice requirement contained in this part or EEOICPA is fully satisfied if served on the representative, and has the same force and effect as if sent to the claimant.</P>

                <P>(2) A representative does not have authority to sign the Form EE-1 (described in § 30.100(a)) or the Form EE-2 (described in § 30.101(a)) for his or her client. A representative also does not have authority to sign the Form EN-20 <PRTPAGE P="138"/>(described in § 30.505(c)) for his or her client</P>

                <P>A claimant may authorize any individual to represent him or her in regard to a claim under EEOICPA, unless that individual's service as a representative would violate any applicable provision of law (such as 18 U.S.C. 205 and 208) or the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP. Under those standards, authorized representatives are prohibited from having private, non-representational financial interests with respect to their client's EEOICPA claims. This does not include their fee for serving as a representative. A Federal employee may act as a representative only:</P>
                <P>(a) On behalf of immediate family members, defined as a spouse, children, parents, and siblings of the representative, provided no fee or gratuity is charged; or</P>

                <P>(a) Notwithstanding any contract, the representative may not receive, for services rendered in connection with a claim pending before OWCP, more than the percentages of the lump-sum payment made to the claimant set out in paragraph (b) of this section, exclusive of costs and expenses.</P>
                <P>(b) The percentages referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:</P>
                <P>(1) 2 percent for the filing of an initial claim with OWCP, provided that the representative was retained prior to the filing of the initial claim; plus</P>

                <P>Since payments received by a covered Part B employee, a covered Part E employee or an eligible surviving beneficiary pursuant to an insurance policy purchased by someone other than a liable third party are not payments in satisfaction of liability for causing an occupational illness or covered illness compensable under the Act, they are not considered a recovery that must be reported to OWCP.</P>

                <P>The type of tort suits described in § 30.615 may be filed by more than one individual, each with a different cause of action. For example, a tort suit may be filed against a beryllium vendor by both a covered Part B employee and his or her spouse, with the covered Part B employee claiming for chronic beryllium disease and the spouse claiming for loss of consortium due to the covered Part B employee's exposure to beryllium. However, since the spouse of a living covered Part B employee could not be an eligible surviving beneficiary under Part B of EEOICPA, the spouse would not have to comply with the termination requirements of §§ 30.616 through 30.618. A similar result would occur if a tort suit were filed by both the spouse of a deceased covered Part B employee and other family members (such as children of the deceased covered part B employee). In this case, the spouse would be the only eligible surviving beneficiary of the deceased covered Part B employee under Part B of the EEOICPA because the other family members could not be eligible for benefits while he or she was alive. As a result, the spouse would be the only party to the tort suit who would have to comply with the termination requirements of §§ 30.616 through 30.618.</P>

                <P>In general, “coordination of benefits” under Part E of the Act occurs when compensation to be received under Part E is reduced by OWCP, pursuant to section 7385s-11 of EEOICPA, to reflect certain benefits the beneficiary receives under a state workers' compensation program for the same covered illness.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How will OWCP coordinate compensation payable under Part E of EEOICPA with benefits from state workers' compensation programs?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) OWCP will reduce the compensation payable under Part E by the amount of benefits the claimant receives from a state workers' compensation program by reason of the same covered illness, after deducting the reasonable costs to the claimant of obtaining those benefits.</P>
                <P>(b) To determine the amount of any reduction of EEOICPA compensation, OWCP shall require the covered Part E employee or each eligible surviving beneficiary filing a claim under Part E to execute and provide affidavits reporting the amount of any benefit received pursuant to a claim filed in a state workers' compensation program for the same covered illness.</P>
                <P>(c) If a covered Part E employee or a survivor of such employee receives benefits through a state workers' compensation program pursuant to a claim for the same covered illness, OWCP shall reduce a portion of the dollar amount of such state workers' benefit from the compensation payable under Part E. OWCP will calculate the net amount of the state workers' compensation benefit amount to be subtracted from the compensation payment under Part E in the following manner:</P>
                <P>(1) OWCP will first determine the dollar value of the benefits received by that individual from a state workers' compensation program by including all benefits, other than medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits, received for the same covered illness or injury sustained as a consequence of a covered illness.</P>
                <P>(2) OWCP will then make certain deductions from the above dollar benefit received under a state workers' compensation program to arrive at the dollar amount that will be subtracted from any compensation payable under Part E of EEOICPA.</P>
                <P>(i) Allowable deductions consist of reasonable costs in obtaining state workers' compensation benefits incurred by that individual, including but not limited to attorney's fees OWCP deems reasonable and itemized costs of suit (out-of-pocket expenditures not part of the normal overhead of a law firm's operation like filing, travel expenses, witness fees, and court reporter costs for transcripts), provided that adequate supporting documentation is submitted to OWCP for its consideration.</P>
                <P>(ii) The EEOICPA benefits that will be reduced will consist of any unpaid monetary payments payable in the future and medical benefits payable in the future. In those cases where it has not yet paid EEOICPA benefits under Part E, OWCP will reduce such benefits on a dollar-for-dollar basis, beginning with the current monetary payments first. If the amount to be subtracted exceeds the monetary payments currently payable, OWCP will reduce ongoing EEOICPA medical benefits payable in the future by the amount of any remaining surplus. This means that OWCP will apply the amount it would otherwise pay to reimburse the covered Part E employee for any ongoing EEOICPA medical treatment to the remaining surplus until it is absorbed (or until further monetary benefits become payable that are sufficient to absorb the surplus).</P>
                <P>(3) The above coordination of benefits will not occur if the beneficiary under a state workers' compensation program receives state workers' compensation benefits for both a covered and a non-covered illness arising out of and in the course of the same work-related incident.</P>

                <P>(a) All providers must enroll with OWCP or its designated bill processing agent (hereinafter OWCP in this subpart) to have access to the automated authorization system and to submit medical bills to OWCP. To enroll, the provider must complete and submit a Form OWCP-1168 to the appropriate location noted on that form. By completing and submitting this form, providers certify that they satisfy all applicable Federal and state licensure and regulatory requirements that apply to their specific provider or supplier type. The provider must maintain documentary evidence indicating that it satisfies those requirements. The provider is also required to notify OWCP immediately if any information provided to OWCP in the enrollment process changes. Federal government medical officers, private physicians and hospitals are also required to keep records of all cases treated by them under EEOICPA so they can supply OWCP with a history of the claimed occupational illness or covered illness, a description of the nature and extent of the claimed occupational illness or covered illness, the results of any diagnostic studies performed and the nature of the treatment rendered. This requirement terminates after a provider has supplied OWCP with the above-noted information, and otherwise terminates ten years after the record was created.</P>
                <P>(b) Where a medical provider intends to bill for a procedure where prior authorization is required, authorization must be requested from OWCP.</P>
                <P>(c) After enrollment, a provider must submit all medical bills to OWCP through its bill processing portal and include the Provider Number/ID obtained through enrollment or other identifying number required by OWCP.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 30.701</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How are medical bills to be submitted?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) All charges for medical and surgical treatment, appliances or supplies furnished to employees, except for treatment and supplies provided by nursing homes, shall be supported by medical evidence as provided in § 30.700. OWCP may withhold payment for services until such report or evidence is provided. The physician or provider shall itemize the charges on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500 (for professional charges or medicinal drugs dispensed in the office), Form OWCP-04 or UB-04 (for hospitals), an electronic or paper-based bill that includes required data elements (for pharmacies) or other form as warranted, and submit the form or bill promptly to OWCP.</P>
                <P>(b) The provider shall identify each service performed using the Physician's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, the National Drug Code (NDC) number, or the Revenue Center Code (RCC), with a brief narrative description. OWCP has discretion to determine which of these codes may be utilized in the billing process. OWCP also has the authority to create and supply specific procedure codes that will be used by OWCP to better describe and allow specific payments for special services. These OWCP-created codes will be issued to providers by OWCP as appropriate and may only be used as authorized by OWCP. For example, a physician conducting a referee or second opinion examination as described in §§ 30.410 through 30.412 will be furnished an OWCP-created code. A provider may not use an OWCP-created code for other types of medical examinations or services. When no code is submitted to identify the services performed, the bill will be returned to the provider and/or denied.</P>

                <P>(c) For professional charges billed on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500, the provider shall also state each diagnosed condition and furnish the corresponding diagnostic code using the “International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification” (ICD-9-CM), or as revised. A separate bill shall be submitted when the employee is discharged from treatment <PRTPAGE P="144"/>or monthly, if treatment for the occupational illness or covered illness is necessary for more than 30 days.</P>
                <P>(1)(i) Hospitals shall submit charges for both inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical treatment or supplies promptly to OWCP on Form OWCP-04 or UB-04.</P>
                <P>(ii) OWCP may adopt a Home Health Prospective Payment System (HHPPS), as developed and implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) within HHS for Medicare, while modifying the allowable costs under Medicare to account for deductibles and other additional costs that are covered by EEOICPA. If adopted, home health care providers will be required to submit bills on Form OWCP-04 or UB-04 and to use Health Insurance Prospective Payment System codes and other coding schemes.</P>
                <P>(2) Pharmacies shall itemize charges for prescription medications, appliances or supplies on electronic or paper-based bills and submit them promptly to OWCP. Bills for prescription medications must include all required data elements, including the NDC number assigned to the product, the generic or trade name of the drug provided, the prescription number, the quantity provided, and the date the prescription was filled.</P>
                <P>(3) Nursing homes shall itemize charges for appliances, supplies or services on the provider's billhead stationery and submit them promptly to OWCP. Such charges shall be subject to any applicable OWCP fee schedule.</P>
                <P>(d) By submitting a bill and/or accepting payment, the provider signifies that the service for which payment is sought was performed as described and was necessary, appropriate and properly billed in accordance with accepted industry standards. For example, accepted industry standards preclude upcoding billed services for extended medical appointments when the employee actually had a brief routine appointment, or charging for the services of a professional when a paraprofessional or aide performed the service. Also, industry standards prohibit unbundling services to charge separately for services that should be billed as a single charge. In addition, the provider thereby agrees to comply with all regulations set forth in this subpart concerning the rendering of treatment and/or the process for seeking payment for medical services, including the limitation imposed on the amount to be paid for such services.</P>
                <P>(e) In summary, bills submitted by providers must: Be itemized on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500 (for physicians), Form OWCP-04 or UB-04 (for hospitals), or an electronic or paper-based bill that includes required data elements (for pharmacies); contain the handwritten or electronic signature of the provider when required; and identify the procedures using HCPCS/CPT codes, RCCs or NDC numbers. Otherwise, OWCP may deny the bill, and the provider must correct and resubmit the bill. The decision of OWCP whether to pay a provider's bill is final when issued and is not subject to the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How should an employee prepare and submit requests for reimbursement for medical expenses, transportation costs, loss of wages, and incidental expenses?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If an employee has paid bills for medical, surgical or other services, supplies or appliances provided by a professional due to an occupational illness or a covered illness, he or she must submit a request for reimbursement on Form OWCP-915, together with an itemized bill on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500 prepared by the provider, or Form OWCP-04 or UB-04 prepared by the provider, and a medical report as provided in § 30.700, to OWCP for consideration.</P>

                <P>(1) The provider of such service shall state each diagnosed condition and furnish the applicable ICD-9-CM code, or as revised, and identify each service performed using the applicable HCPCS/CPT code, with a brief narrative description of the service performed, or, where no code is applicable, a detailed description of that service. If no code or description is received, OWCP will deny the reimbursement request, and correction and resubmission will be required.<PRTPAGE P="145"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The reimbursement request must be accompanied by evidence that the provider received payment for the service from the employee and a statement of the amount paid. Acceptable evidence that payment was received includes, but is not limited to, a signed statement by the provider, a mechanical stamp or other device showing receipt of payment, a copy of the employee's canceled check (both front and back), a copy of the employee's credit card receipt or a provider billing form indicating a zero balance due.</P>
                <P>(b) If a pharmacy or nursing home provided services for which the employee paid, the employee must also use Form OWCP-915 to request reimbursement and should submit the request in accordance with the provisions of § 30.701(a). Any such request for reimbursement must be accompanied by evidence, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that the provider received payment for the service from the employee and a statement of the amount paid.</P>
                <P>(c) OWCP may waive the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if extensive delays in the filing or the adjudication of a claim make it unusually difficult for the employee to obtain the required information.</P>
                <P>(d) Copies of bills submitted for reimbursement must bear the handwritten or electronic signature of the provider when required, with evidence of payment. Payment for medical and surgical treatment, appliances or supplies shall in general be no greater than the maximum allowable charge for such service determined by OWCP, as set forth in § 30.705. OWCP will issue a letter decision on whether to reimburse an employee for out-of-pocket medical expenses, and the amount of any reimbursement. A claimant who disagrees with OWCP's letter decision may request a formal recommended decision and utilize the adjudicatory process described in subpart D of this part.</P>
                <P>(e) An employee will be only partially reimbursed for a medical expense if the amount he or she paid to a provider for the service exceeds the maximum allowable charge set by OWCP's schedule. If this happens, OWCP shall advise the employee of the maximum allowable charge for the service in question and of his or her responsibility to ask the provider to refund to the employee, or credit to the employee's account, the amount he or she paid which exceeds the maximum allowable charge. The provider that the employee paid, but not the employee, may request reconsideration of the fee determination as set forth in § 30.712.</P>
                <P>(f) If the provider fails to make appropriate refund to the employee, or to credit the employee's account, within 60 days after the employee requests a refund of any excess amount, or the date of a subsequent reconsideration decision which continues to disallow all or a portion of the disputed amount, OWCP will initiate exclusion procedures as provided by § 30.715.</P>
                <P>(g) If the provider does not refund to the employee or credit to his or her account the amount of money paid in excess of the charge which OWCP allows, the employee should submit documentation of the attempt to obtain such refund or credit to OWCP. OWCP may authorize reasonable reimbursement to the employee after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>

                <P>(a) The “locality” which serves as a basis for the determination of cost is defined by the Bureau of Census Metropolitan Statistical Areas. OWCP shall base the determination of the relative per capita cost of medical care in a locality using information about enrollment and medical cost per county, provided by CMS.</P>

                <P>(a) OWCP will pay for inpatient medical services according to pre-determined, condition-specific rates based on the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) devised by CMS.

                <P>(2) The provider-specific factors will be provided by CMS in the form of their IPPS Pricer software program.

                <P>(b) All outpatient medical services will be classified according to the APC prescribed by CMS for that service in the form of the Outpatient Prospective Payment System Grouper software program.

                <P>(a) A physician or other provider whose charge for service is only partially paid because it exceeds a maximum allowable amount set by OWCP may, within 30 days, request reconsideration of the fee determination.</P>
                <P>(1) The provider should make such a request to the district office with jurisdiction over the employee's claim. The request must be accompanied by documentary evidence that the procedure performed was either incorrectly identified by the original code, that the presence of a severe or concomitant medical condition made treatment especially difficult, or that the provider possessed unusual qualifications. In itself, board certification in a specialty is not sufficient evidence of unusual qualifications to justify a charge in excess of the maximum allowable amount set by OWCP. These are the only three circumstances that will justify reevaluation of the paid amount.</P>

                <P>(2) A list of district offices and their respective areas of jurisdiction is available upon request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Washington, DC 20210, or at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/index.htm.</E> Within 30 days of receiving the request for reconsideration, the district office shall respond in writing stating whether or not an additional amount will be allowed as reasonable, considering the evidence submitted.</P>
                <P>(b) If the district office issues a decision that continues to disallow a contested amount, the provider may apply to the Regional Director of the region with jurisdiction over the district office. The application must be filed within 30 days of the date of such decision, and it may be accompanied by additional evidence. Within 60 days of receipt of such application, the Regional Director shall issue a decision in writing stating whether or not an additional amount will be allowed as reasonable, considering the evidence submitted. This decision is final, and shall not be subject to further review.</P>

                <P>(a) If a physician, hospital, or provider of medical services or supplies has been automatically excluded pursuant to § 30.716, the provider excluded will automatically be reinstated upon notice to OWCP that the conviction or exclusion which formed the basis of the automatic exclusion has been reversed or withdrawn. However, an automatic reinstatement shall not preclude OWCP from instituting exclusion proceedings based upon the underlying facts of the matter.</P>

                <P>(b) A physician, hospital, or provider of medical services or supplies excluded from participation as a result of an order issued pursuant to this subpart may apply for reinstatement one year after the entry of the order of exclusion, unless the order expressly provides for a shorter period. An application for reinstatement shall be addressed to the Director for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation, and shall contain a concise statement of the basis for the application.

                <P>Years of wage-loss occurring prior to normal retirement age that are the result of a covered illness contracted by a covered Part E employee through work-related exposure to a toxic substance at a Department of Energy facility or a RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate, may be compensable under Part E of the Act. Whether years of wage-loss are compensable depends on determinations with respect to:</P>
                <P>(a) The average annual wage of the employee as determined by OWCP in accordance with § 30.810;</P>
                <P>(b) The percentage of his or her average annual wage that the employee was able to earn during the calendar year(s) in question as determined by OWCP in accordance with § 30.811; and</P>
                <P>(c) Whether the employee's inability to earn at least as much as his or her average annual wage was due to a covered illness as defined in § 30.5(s).</P>

                <SUBJECT>What special definitions does OWCP use in connection with Part E wage-loss determinations?</SUBJECT>
                <P>For the purposes of paying compensation based on wage-loss under Part E of the Act, OWCP will apply the following definitions:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Average annual wage</E> means 12 times the average monthly wage of a covered Part E employee for the 36 months preceding the month during which he or she first experienced wage-loss due to exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility (referred to as the “trigger month”), excluding any months during which the employee was unemployed. Because being “retired” is not equivalent to being “unemployed,” months during which an employee had no wages because he or she was retired will not be excluded from this calculation.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Normal retirement age</E> means the age at which a covered Part E employee first became eligible for unreduced retirement benefits under the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) provisions of the Social Security Act. In general, persons born during or before 1937 are eligible for unreduced OASDI retirement benefits at age 65, and that age increases in monthly increments until it reaches 67, which is the age at which persons born during or after 1960 become eligible for unreduced OASDI retirement benefits.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Month during which the employee was unemployed</E> means any month during which the covered Part E employee had $250 (in constant 2013 dollars) or less in wages unless the month is one during which the employee was retired.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Quarter</E> means the three-month period January through March, April through June, July through September, or October through December.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Quarter during which the employee was unemployed</E> means any quarter during which the covered Part E employee had $750 (in constant 2013 dollars) or less in wages unless the quarter is one during which the employee was retired.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Trigger month</E> means the calendar month during which the employee first experienced a loss in wages due to exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility.<PRTPAGE P="155"/>
                </P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Wages</E> mean all monetary payments that the covered Part E employee earns from his or her regular employment or services that are taxed as income by the Internal Revenue Service. Salaries, overtime compensation, sick leave, vacation leave, tips, and bonuses received for employment services are considered wages under this subpart. However, capital gains, IRA distributions, pensions, annuities, unemployment compensation, state workers' compensation benefits, medical retirement benefits, and Social Security benefits are not considered wages.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Year of wage-loss</E> means a calendar year during which the covered Part E employee's earnings were less than his or her average annual wage, after such earnings have been adjusted using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), as produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to reflect their value in the year during which the employee first experienced wage-loss due to exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or RECA section 5 facility.</P>

                <P>(a) In addition to satisfying the general eligibility requirements applicable to all Part E claims, a claimant seeking benefits for calendar years of qualifying wage-loss has the burden of proof to establish each of the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) He or she held a job at which he or she earned wages;</P>
                <P>(2) He or she experienced a loss in those wages in a particular month (referred to as the “trigger month” in this section);</P>

                <P>(3) The wage-loss in the trigger month was caused by the covered Part E employee's covered illness, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> that he or she would have continued to earn wages in the trigger month from that employment <E T="03">but for the covered illness;</E>
                </P>
                <P>(4) His or her average annual wage;</P>
                <P>(5) His or her normal retirement age and the calendar year in which he or she would reach that age;</P>
                <P>(6) Beginning with the calendar year of the trigger month, the percentage of the average annual wage that was earned in each calendar year up to and including the retirement year;</P>
                <P>(7) The number of those calendar years in which the covered illness caused the covered Part E employee to earn 50% or less of his or her average annual wage; and</P>
                <P>(8) The number of those calendar years in which the covered illness caused him or her to earn more than 50% but not more than 75% of his or her average annual wage.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP will discontinue development of a request for wage-loss benefits, during which the claimant must meet his or her burden of proof to establish each of the criteria listed in paragraph (a) of this section, at any point when the claimant is unable to meet such burden and proceed to issue a recommended decision to deny the request.</P>

                <P>OWCP requires the submission of rationalized medical evidence of sufficient probative value to convince the fact-finder that the covered Part E employee experienced a loss in wages in his or her trigger month due to a covered illness, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> medical evidence based on a physician's fully explained and reasoned decision (see § 30.805(a)(3)). A loss in wages in the trigger month due solely to non-covered illness matters, such as a reduction in force or voluntary retirement, is not proof of compensable wage-loss under Part E.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What factual evidence does OWCP use to determine a covered Part E employee's average annual wage?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) OWCP may rely on annual or quarterly wage information reported to the Social Security Administration to establish a covered Part E employee's <PRTPAGE P="156"/>presumed average annual wage (see § 30.810) and the duration and extent of any years of wage-loss that are compensable under Part E of the Act (see § 30.811). OWCP may also rely on other probative evidence of a covered Part E employee's wages, and may ask the claimant for additional evidence needed to make this determination, if necessary. For the purposes of making these two types of determinations, OWCP will consider all monetary payments that the covered Part E employee received as wages (see § 30.801(g)).</P>
                <P>(b) A claimant who disagrees with the evidence OWCP has obtained under paragraph (a) of this section and alleges a different average annual wage for the covered Part E employee, or that there was a greater duration or extent of wage-loss, may submit records that were produced in the ordinary course of business due to the employee's employment to rebut that evidence, to the extent that such records are determined to be authentic by OWCP. The average annual wage and/or wage-loss of the covered Part E employee will then be determined by OWCP in the exercise of its discretion.</P>

                <P>(a) To determine the initial calendar years of wage-loss, OWCP will use the evidence it receives under §§ 30.805 through 30.807 to compare the calendar-year wages for the covered Part E employee, as adjusted, with the average annual wage determined under § 30.810 for each calendar year beginning with the calendar year that includes the trigger month, and concluding with the last calendar year of wage-loss prior to the submission of the claim or the calendar year in which the employee reached normal retirement age (as defined in § 30.801(b)), whichever occurred first.</P>
                <P>(b) OWCP will then aggregate separately the number of calendar years of wage-loss in which the employee's wages, as adjusted, did not exceed 50 percent of the average annual wage determined under § 30.810, and the number of calendar years of wage-loss in which the employee's wages, as adjusted, exceeded 50 percent of such average annual wage, but did not exceed 75 percent of such average annual wage.</P>
                <P>(c) For each calendar year of wage-loss determined under paragraph (c) of this section during which the employee's wages did not exceed 50 percent of his or her average annual wage, OWCP will pay the employee $15,000 as compensation for wage-loss. For each calendar year of wage-loss determined under paragraph (c) of this section during which the employee's calendar-year wages exceeded 50 percent of his or her average annual wage but did not exceed 75 percent of such average annual wage, OWCP will pay the employee $10,000 as compensation for wage-loss.</P>

During these particular calendar years, OWCP will also presume that the deceased covered Part E employee's subsequent calendar-year wages did not exceed 50 percent of his or her average annual wage as determined under § 30.810.</P>
                <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, OWCP will calculate the wage-loss of a deceased covered Part E employee in conformance with the provisions of §§ 30.800 through 30.811.</P>
                <P>(c) If OWCP determines that a deceased covered Part E employee had an aggregate of not less than ten calendar years of adjusted earnings that did not exceed 50 percent of his or her average annual earnings, it will pay the eligible surviving beneficiary(s) additional compensation (the basic survivor award payable under section 7385s-3(a)(1) is $125,000) in the amount of $25,000 pursuant to section 7385s-3(a)(2) of the Act. In the alternative, if OWCP determines that the aggregate number of such years is not less than 20 years, it will pay the eligible surviving beneficiary(s) additional compensation in the amount of $50,000 pursuant to section 7385s-3(a)(3).</P>

                <P>In order to receive impairment benefits under Part E, the employee must show that:</P>
                <P>(a) He or she is a covered Part E employee who has been determined to have contracted a covered illness through exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility, as appropriate, pursuant to either §§ 30.210 through 30.215 or §§ 30.230 through 30.232 of these regulations; and</P>

                <P>(a) OWCP will determine the amount of impairment benefits to which an employee is entitled based on one or more impairment evaluations submitted by physicians. An impairment evaluation shall contain the physician's opinion on the extent of whole person impairment of all organs and body functions of the employee that are compromised or otherwise affected by the employee's covered illness or illnesses, which shall be referred to as an “impairment rating.”</P>
                <P>(b) In making impairment benefit determinations, OWCP will only consider medical reports from physicians who are certified by the relevant medical board and who satisfy any additional criteria determined by OWCP to be necessary to qualify to perform impairment evaluations under Part E, including any specific training and experience related to particular conditions and other objective factors.</P>

                <P>(c) OWCP will establish criteria based upon objective factors such as training and certification that must be <PRTPAGE P="158"/>met by physicians preparing impairment evaluations in order for an impairment evaluation to be considered in determining an impairment award.

                <SUBJECT>How may an impairment evaluation be obtained?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, OWCP may request that an employee undergo an evaluation of his or her permanent impairment that specifies the percentage points that are the result of the employee's covered illness or illnesses. To be of any probative value, such evaluation must be performed by a physician who meets the criteria OWCP has identified for physicians performing impairment evaluations for the pertinent covered illness or illnesses in accordance with the AMA's <E T="03">Guides.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(b) In lieu of submitting an evaluation requested by OWCP under paragraph (a) of this section, an employee may obtain an impairment evaluation at his own initiative and submit it to OWCP for consideration. Such an evaluation will be deemed to have sufficient probative value to be considered in the adjudication of impairment benefits by OWCP only if:</P>
                <P>(1) The evaluation was performed by a physician who meets the criteria identified by OWCP for the covered illness or illnesses in question;</P>
                <P>(2) The evaluation was performed no more than one year before the date that it was received by OWCP; and</P>

                <SUBJECT>Who will pay for an impairment evaluation?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) OWCP will pay for one impairment evaluation obtained by an employee if it meets the criteria set out in § 30.905(b), unless it was performed by a physician prior to the date that the claim for Part E benefits is filed, or obtained for a claim in which OWCP finds that the employee did not contract a covered illness. At its discretion, OWCP may direct that the employee undergo additional evaluations. OWCP will pay for any such additional evaluations and will reimburse the employee for any reasonable and necessary costs incident to the evaluations, as described in §§ 30.404 and 30.412 of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) Except for one impairment evaluation obtained pursuant to § 30.905(b) and meeting the criteria set out in § 30.905(b)(1), (2) and (3), the employee must pay for any impairment evaluations not directed by OWCP.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Can an impairment evaluation obtained by OWCP be challenged prior to issuance of the recommended decision?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An employee may submit arguments challenging an impairment evaluation, and/or additional medical evidence of impairment, before the district office issues a recommended decision on his or her claim. However, the district office will not consider an additional impairment evaluation, even if it differs from the impairment evaluation obtained under § 30.905 or § 30.906, if it does not meet the criteria listed in § 30.905(b)(1), (2) and (3).</P>

                <P>(b) If the district office obtains an additional impairment evaluation that differs from the impairment evaluation obtained under § 30.905 or § 30.906, the district office will base its recommended determinations regarding <PRTPAGE P="159"/>impairment upon the evidence it considers to have the greatest probative value, after evaluating all relevant evidence of impairment in the record, including evidence from directed impairment evaluations and referee impairment evaluations, if any, that it deems necessary pursuant to §§ 30.410 and 30.411 of this part.</P>

                <P>(b) The employee shall bear the burden of proving that the additional impairment evaluation submitted is more probative than the evaluation relied upon by the district office to determine the employee's recommended impairment rating.</P>
                <P>(c) If an employee submits an additional impairment evaluation that differs from the impairment evaluation relied upon by the district office, the FAB will review all relevant evidence of impairment in the record, and will base its determinations regarding impairment upon the evidence it considers to be most probative. The FAB will determine the impairment rating after it has evaluated all relevant evidence and argument in the record.</P>

                <P>(a) An impairment that is the result of a covered illness will be included in the employee's impairment rating determined by OWCP under § 30.901 only if OWCP concludes that the impairment has reached maximum medical improvement, which means that it is well-stabilized and unlikely to improve substantially with or without medical treatment.</P>
                <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if OWCP finds that an employee's covered illness is in the terminal stages, based upon probative medical evidence, an impairment that results from such covered illness will be included in the impairment rating for the employee even if it has not reached maximum medical improvement.</P>

                <P>A covered Part E employee previously awarded impairment benefits by OWCP may file a claim for additional impairment benefits. Such claim must be based on an increase in the impairment rating that is the result of the covered illness or illnesses from the impairment rating that formed the basis for the last award of such benefits by OWCP. OWCP will only adjudicate claims for such an increased rating that are filed at least two years from the date of the last award of impairment benefits. However, OWCP will not wait two years before it will adjudicate a claim for additional impairment that is based on an allegation that the employee sustained a new covered illness.</P>

              <P>(b) The Office shall not provide reimbursement in any case in which an additional premium for war-risk hazard was charged, or in which the carrier <PRTPAGE P="164"/>has been reimbursed, paid, or compensated for the loss for which reimbursement is requested.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing a request for reimbursement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A carrier or employer may file a request for reimbursement. The request shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Branch of Special Claims, P.O. Box 37117, Washington, DC 20013-7117;</P>
              <P>(b) Each request for reimbursement shall include documentation itemizing the payments for which reimbursement is claimed. The documentation shall be sufficient to establish the purpose of the payment, the name of the payee, the date(s) for which payment was made, and the amount of the payment. Copies of any medical reports and bills related to medical examination or treatment for which reimbursement is claimed shall also be submitted.

              <SUBJECT>Disposition of reimbursement requests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the Office finds that insufficient or inadequate information has been submitted with the claim, the carrier shall be asked to submit further information. Failure to supply the requested information may result in disallowance of items not adequately supported as properly reimbursable.</P>
              <P>(b) The Office shall not withhold payment of an approved part of a reimbursement request because of denial of another part of the reimbursement request.</P>
              <P>(c) The Office shall regard awards, decisions and approved settlement agreements under the Defense Base Act or other applicable workers' compensation law, that have become final, as establishing prima facie, the right of the beneficiary to the payment awarded or provided for.</P>
              <P>(d) The Office shall advise the carrier of the amount approved for reimbursement. If the reimbursement request has been denied in whole or in part, the Office shall provide the carrier an explanation of the action taken and the reasons for the action. A carrier within the United States may file objections with the Associate Director for Federal Employees' Compensation to the disallowance or reduction of a claim within 60 days of the Office's decision. A carrier outside the United States has six months within which to file objections with the Associate Director. The Office may consider objections filed beyond the time limits under unusual circumstances or when reasonable cause has been shown for the delay. A determination by the Office is final.</P>
              <P>(e) In determining whether a claim is reimbursable, the Office shall hold the carrier to the same degree of care and prudence as any individual or corporation in the protection of its interests or the handling of its affairs would be expected to exercise under similar circumstances. A part or an item of a claim may be disapproved if the Office finds that the carrier—</P>
              <P>(1) Failed to take advantage of any right accruing by assignment or subrogation (except against the United States, directly or indirectly, its employees, or members of its armed forces) due to the liability of a third party, unless the financial condition of the third party or the facts and circumstances surrounding the liability justify the failure;</P>

              <P>(2) Failed to take reasonable measures to contest, reduce, or terminate its liability by appropriate available <PRTPAGE P="165"/>procedure under workers' compensation law or otherwise; or</P>
              <P>(3) Failed to make reasonable and adequate investigation or injury as to the right of any person to any benefit or payment; or</P>
              <P>(4) Failed to avoid augmentation of liability by reason of delay in recognizing or discharging a compensation claimant's right to benefits.</P>

The carrier shall furnish the records and permit or authorize their inspection as requested. The right of inspection shall also relate to records and data necessary for the determination of whether any premium or other charge was made with respect to the reimbursement claimed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reimbursement of claims expense.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A carrier may claim reimbursement for reasonable and necessary claims expense incurred in connection with a case for which reimbursement is claimed under the Act. Reimbursement may be claimed for allocated and unallocated claims expense.</P>
              <P>(b) The term “allocated claims expense” includes payments made for reasonable attorneys' fees, court and litigation costs, expenses of witnesses and expert testimony, examinations, autopsies and other items of expense that were reasonably incurred in determining liability under the Defense Base Act or other workers' compensation law. Allocated claims expense must be itemized and documented as described in § 61.101.</P>
              <P>(c) The term “unallocated claims expense” means costs that are incurred in processing a claim, but cannot be specifically itemized or documented. A carrier may receive reimbursement of unallocated claims expense in an amount of to 15% of the sum of the reimbursable payments made under the Defense Base Act or other workers' compensation law. If this method of computing unallocated claims expense would not result in reimbursement of reasonable and necessary claims expense, the Office may, in its discretion, determine an amount that fairly represents the expenses incurred.</P>
              <P>(d) The Office shall not consider as a claims expense any general administrative costs, general office maintenance costs, rent, insurance, taxes, or other similar general expenses. Nor shall expenses incurred in establishing or documenting entitlement to reimbursement under the Act be considered.</P>

              <P>(a) The Office may pay benefits, as they accrue, directly to any entitled beneficiary in lieu of reimbursement of a carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) The Office will not accept a case for direct payment until the right of the person or persons entitled to benefits has been established and the Office finds that the carrier would be entitled to reimbursement for continuing benefits.</P>
              <P>(c) The Office will not accept a case for direct payment until the rate of compensation or benefit and the period of payment have become relatively fixed and known. The Office may accept a case for direct payment before this condition has been satisfied, if the Office determines that direct payment is advisable due to the circumstances in that particular case.</P>

              <P>(d) In cases transferred to the Office for direct payment, medical care for the effects of a war-risk injury may be furnished in a manner consistent with the regulations governing the furnishing of medical care under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 8101, <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(e) The transfer of a case to the Office for direct payment does not affect the hearing or adjudicatory rights of a beneficiary or carrier as established under the Defense Base Act or other applicable workers' compensation law.</P>
              <P>(f) The Office may retransfer any case to a carrier either for the purpose of completion of adjudicatory processes or for continuation of payment of benefits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of detention status.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A determination that an employee has been detained by a hostile force or person may be made on the basis that the employee has disappeared under circumstances that make detention appear probable. In making the determination, the Office will consider the information and the conclusion of the Department or agency of the United States having knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the absence of the employee as prima facie evidence of the employee's status. The presumptive status of total disability of the missing person shall continue during the period of the absence, or until death is in fact established or can be legally presumed to have occurred.</P>

              <P>(b) If any employee or dependent receives or claims wages, payments in lieu of wages, or insurance benefits for the period of detention, and the cost of the wages, payments or benefits is provided in whole or in part by the United States, the Office shall credit the amount of the benefits against any detention payments to which the person is entitled under the Act. The Office shall apply credit only where the wages, payments, or benefits received are items for which the contractor is entitled to reimbursement from the United States, or where they are otherwise reimbursable by the United States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General administrative provisions.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Section 5(f) of the War Claims Act of 1948 (act of July 3, 1948; Pub. L. 896, 80th Cong., 62 Stat. 1240) makes provision for the payment of benefits with respect to the injury, disability or death resulting from injury of any civilian American citizen occurring while he was held by or in hiding from the Imperial Japanese Government to the same extent as if such civilian American citizen were an employee within the purview of the act of December 2, 1942 (Pub. L. 784, 77th Cong., 56 Stat. 1028, 42 U.S.C. 1701, <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Under section 5(f) of the said War Claims Act of 1948, the rights of individuals to benefits payable under this subchapter shall accrue from and after December 7, 1941, subject, however, to all of the provisions of said act and the regulations in this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(b) The regulations in part 61 of subchapter F of this chapter governing the administration of the benefits provided under titles I and II of the said act of December 2, 1942, as amended, shall, insofar as they are applicable and are not inconsistent with any of the provisions of this subchapter, govern the administration of the benefits payable under this subchapter. Provisions of such regulations relating to benefits for detention by the enemy, reimbursement to an employer or insurance carrier, and limitations on benefits in cases where workmen's compensation is payable are not applicable to the benefits provided in this subchapter nor are they within the purview of this subchapter. The provisions of sections 101(b), 104 and 105 of such act of December 2, 1942, and the various provisions of part 61 of this chapter relating to such provisions, accordingly, are not applicable to the payment of benefits under this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(c) All rights or benefits under this subchapter which are determinable with reference to other provisions of law other than the said War Claims Act of 1948, shall be determined with reference to such provisions as they existed and were in force on January 3, 1948.</P>
            <P>(d) As used in this subchapter:</P>
            <P>(1) The term “Bureau” means the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, U.S. Department of Labor.</P>

            <P>(2) The term “civilian American citizen” means any person who, being then a citizen of the United States, was captured by the Imperial Japanese Government on or after December 7, 1941, at Midway, Guam, Wake Island, the Philippine Islands, or any Territory or possession of the United States attacked or invaded by such government or while in transit to or from any such place, or who went into hiding at any such place in order to avoid capture or internment by such government; except (i) a person who at any time voluntarily gave aid to, collaborated with, or in any manner served such government, or (ii) a person who at the time of his capture or entrance into hiding was within the purview of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act of September 7, 1918, as amended and extended, or the said act of December 2, 1942, as amended, or the Missing Persons Act of March 7, 1942 (56 Stat. 143), as amended, or who was a regularly appointed, enrolled, enlisted, or <PRTPAGE P="172"/>inducted member of any military or naval force.</P>
            <P>(3) The terms “held by the Imperial Japanese Government” or “captured by the Imperial Japanese Government” mean a holding of such person as a prisoner, internee, hostage or in any other capacity.</P>
            <P>(4) The terms “compensation”, “physician” and “medical, surgical and hospital services and supplies” shall be construed and applied as defined in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act of September 7, 1916, as amended.</P>
            <P>(5) The term “benefit” is construed as synonymous with the term “compensation”.</P>
            <P>(6) The terms “disability”, “wages”, “child”, “grandchild”, “brother”, “sister”, “parent”, “widow”, “widower”, “adoption” or “adopted” shall be construed and applied as defined in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as amended.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 71.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Computation of benefits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For the purpose of determining the benefits under this subchapter, the average weekly wage of any such civilian American citizen, whether employed, self-employed, or not employed, shall be deemed to have been $37.50. The provisions of this subchapter are applicable and benefits are payable whether or not such civilian American citizen was employed. Monthly compensation in cases involving partial disability shall be determined by the percentage which the degree of partial disability bears to total disability, and shall not be determined with respect to the extent of loss of wage-earning capacity.</P>
            <P>(b) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of part 61 of this chapter, total maximum aggregate compensation for disability payable under this subchapter is limited to $7,500 in case of injury and $7,500 in case of death, such sum being exclusive of medical costs and funeral and burial expenses.</P>

            <P>(b) The benefit of a minor or an incompetent person who has no natural or legal guardian may, in the discretion of the Bureau be paid in whole or in such part as the Bureau may determine, for and on behalf of such minor or incompetent directly to the person or institution caring for, supporting or having custody of such minor or incompetent.</P>
            <P>(c) In any case in which benefits are payable under this subchapter to any person who is prevented from accepting such benefits by the rules, regulations or customs of the church or the religious order or organization of which he is a member, such benefits will be paid, upon the request of such person, to such church or to such religious order or organization.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Designation of central and field organization.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> (1) The Railroad Retirement Board (hereinafter referenced as the “Board”) is an independent agency in the executive branch of the Federal Government and is administered by three members appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. By law, one member is appointed upon recommendations made by railroad labor organizations, one upon recommendations of railroad employers, and the third member, the Chairman, is in effect independent of employees and employers and represents the public interest. The terms of office are five years and are arranged so as to expire in different calendar years.</P>
            <P>(2) The primary function of the Board is the determination and payment of benefits under the retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness programs. To this end, the Board must maintain lifetime earnings records for covered employees, a network of field offices to assist railroad personnel and their dependents in filing claims for benefits, and examiners to adjudicate the claims.</P>
            <P>(3) The Board administers the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The Railroad Retirement Tax Act, which imposes employment taxes to fund the railroad retirement system, is administered by the Internal Revenue Service of the U.S. Department of Treasury. The Board also participates in the administration of the Federal Medicare health insurance program.</P>
            <P>(4) The headquarters of the Board is in Chicago, Illinois, at 844 North Rush Street. The Board maintains numerous district offices across the country in localities easily accessible to large numbers of railroad workers.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Internal organization.</E> (1) Reporting directly to the Board Members is the seven member Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is comprised of the General Counsel, the Director of Administration, the Director of Programs, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Information Officer, and the Director of Field Service. The Chief Actuary is a non-voting member. The Board members will designate a member of the Executive Committee as Senior Executive Officer.</P>

            <P>(2) The Executive Committee is responsible for the day to day operations of the agency. The Senior Executive Officer is responsible for the direction and oversight of the Executive Committee. The General Counsel is responsible for advising the Board Members on major issues, interpreting the Acts and regulations administered by the Board, drafting and analyzing legislation, representing the Board in litigation and administrative forums and planning, directing, and coordinating the work of the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Secretary to the Board, the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, and the Office of Legislative Affairs through their respective directors. The Director of Programs is responsible for managing, coordinating, and controlling the program operations <PRTPAGE P="180"/>of the agency which carry out provisions of the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Acts. The Director of Administration is responsible for managing, coordinating and controlling certain administrative operations of the Board including the Division of Acquisition Management, the Bureau of Human Resources, the Office of Public Affairs, and the Division of Real Property Management. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the financial management of the agency, and the Chief Information Officer is responsible for coordinating the agency's information resources management program. The Chief Actuary is responsible for the actuarial program of the Board, and for maintaining statistical and financial information. The Director of Field Services is responsible for the oversight of the agency's nationwide field offices.</P>
            <P>(3) The Office of Equal Employment Opportunity is responsible for equal employment opportunity and affirmative employment programs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Office of Inspector General.</E> The Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 established the Office of Inspector General within the Board to be governed by the Inspector General Act of 1978. As structured, the Inspector General reports directly to the Chairman. The Office of Inspector General is responsible for policy direction and conduct of audit, inspection, and investigation activities relating to program and operations of the Board; and maintaining liaison with other law enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice, and United States Attorneys on all matters relating to the detection and prevention of fraud and abuse. The Inspector General reports semi-annually to the Congress through the Chairman concerning fraud, abuses, other serious problems, and deficiencies of agency programs and operations; recommends corrective action; and, reports on progress made in implementing these actions.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Retirement and death benefits.</E> (1) Retirement and death benefits must be applied for by filing application therefor. (For details as to application, see parts 210 and 237 of this chapter). The Bureau of Retirement Claims considers the application and the evidence and information submitted with it. Wage and service records maintained by the Board are checked and if necessary, further evidence is obtained from the employee, the employer, fellow employees, public records and any other person or source available. The Bureau makes initial decisions on the following matters:</P>
            <P>(i) Applications for benefits;</P>
            <P>(ii) Requests for the withdrawal of an application;</P>
            <P>(iii) Requests for a change in an annuity beginning date;</P>
            <P>(iv) The termination of an annuity;</P>
            <P>(v) The modification of the amount of an annuity or lump sum;</P>
            <P>(vi) Requests for the reinstatement of an annuity which had been terminated or modified;</P>
            <P>(vii) The existence of an erroneous payment;</P>
            <P>(viii) The eligibility of an individual for a supplemental annuity or the amount of such supplemental annuity.</P>
            <P>(ix) Whether representative payments shall serve the interests of an individual by reason of his incapacity to manage his annuity payments; and</P>
            <P>(x) Who shall be appointed or continued as representative payee on behalf of an annuitant.</P>

            <P>(2) A claimant dissatisfied with the Bureau's decision may, upon filing notice within one year from the date the decision is mailed to the claimant, appeal to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That (i) an individual under age 16 shall not have the right to appeal a finding of incapacity to manage his annuity payments, but shall have the right to contest on appeal that he is, in fact, under age 16; (ii) an individual who has been adjudged legally incompetent shall not have the right to appeal a finding of incapacity to manage his annuity payments, but shall have the right to contest on appeal the fact of his having <PRTPAGE P="181"/>been adjudged legally incompetent; and (iii) an individual shall not have the right to appeal a denial of his application to serve as representative payee on behalf of an annuitant. There he may have an oral hearing before a hearings officer of which a stenographic record is made, submit additional evidence, be represented, and present written and oral argument. If dissatisfied with the decision of the hearings officer, the claimant may appeal to the Board itself. This appeal must be made on a prescribed form within four months of the date a copy of the hearings officer's decision was mailed to him. If new evidence is received, the Board may remand the case to the hearings officer for investigation and recommendation concerning the new evidence. (For details on appeals procedure, see part 260 of this chapter.) A claimant, after he has unsuccessfully appealed to the Board itself and has thus exhausted all administrative remedies within the Board, may obtain a review of a final decision of the Board by filing a petition for review, within one year after the entry of the decision on the records of the Board and its communication to the claimant, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the claimant resides, or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Unemployment, sickness, and maternity benefits.</E> (1) Claims for unemployment benefits are handled by a comprehensive organization set up in the field. Under agreements between the Railroad Retirement Board and covered employers, the employers select employees of theirs to act as unemployment claims agents. These agents perform their services, specified in the agreement, in accordance with instructions issued by the Board but under general supervision and control of the employer. In accordance with the agreements, employers are reimbursed for such services at the rate of 50 cents for each claim taken by an unemployment claims agent and transmitted to the Board. There are some 13,000 such contract claims agents. An unemployed person who wishes to file a claim for unemployment benefits need only consult his recent railroad employer to be directed to the unemployment claims agent with whom he may file his claim.</P>
            <P>(2) When an employee makes his first claim in any benefit year, he identifies himself and fills out an application for unemployment benefits (UI-1), an application for employment service (Form ES-1), and a pay rate report (Form UI 1a) to be used in determining the rate at which benefits may be paid. The employee is given an informational booklet UB-4 and an Unemployment Bulletin No. UB-3 informing him of his responsibilities and explaining the statements to which he is required to certify and to which he does certify when he registers for benefits. When the applications and pay rate report are completed, the unemployment claims agent sends them to the nearest field office of the Board. That office inspects the applications to detect errors and omissions and to note items requiring investigation. The office also attempts to verify the employee's statement about his pay rate unless the unemployment claims agent has already done so. The application for unemployment benefits and the pay rate report are then sent to the appropriate regional office of the Board. The application for employment service is retained in the field office for use in referring the claimant to suitable job openings. On the basis of the information furnished on the application for unemployment benefits, the regional office determines whether the applicant is a qualified employee (that is, whether he earned $500 or more from covered employment in the base year). The applicant is notified by letter if he is found to be not qualified.</P>

            <P>(3) In addition to the application forms and pay rate report, the claimant executes a registration and claim for unemployment insurance benefits (Form UI-3). In substance, registration consists of his appearing before an unemployment claims agent during the agent's working hours and signing his name on the registration and claim form for the days he wishes to claim as days of unemployment. Registration for any day must be made on the day or not later than the sixth calendar day thereafter, except that, if such calendar day is not a business day, the claimant may make his registration on <PRTPAGE P="182"/>the next following business day. In other words, a claimant must ordinarily appear for registration at seven-day intervals. Under certain circumstances, such as illness, employment, looking for employment, etc., an employee may make a delayed registration for any day for which he is unable to register within the time limit mentioned above. The unemployment claims agent sends the claim to the nearest field office where it is inspected with a view to calling the claimant in for interview or referral to job openings, detecting errors and omissions, and noting items requiring investigation. The claim is then forwarded to the regional office.</P>
            <P>(4) Claims for sickness benefits are handled by the field organization of the Board. An employee need not register in person for sickness benefits but claims for such benefits must be made on the forms prescribed by the Board and executed by the individual claiming benefits except that, if the Board is satisfied that an employee is so sick or injured that he cannot sign forms, the Board may accept forms executed by someone else in his behalf. Forms used in connection with claims for sickness benefits may be obtained from a railroad employer, a railway labor organization, or any Board office. An application for sickness benefits (Form SI-1a) and the required statement of sickness (Form SI-1b) may be mailed to any office of the Board (see part 335 of this chapter). It is important that a statement of sickness be filed promptly, for no day can be considered as a day of sickness unless a statement of sickness with respect to such day is filed at an office of the Board within ten days. The application and statement of sickness are forwarded to a regional office where they are examined. If it appears that the employee is entitled to benefits, the regional office will send him a claim form covering a 14-day registration period, and a pay rate report (Form SI-1d). The employee completes the forms, indicating on the claim form the days during the period he claims as days of sickness and returns both forms to the regional office to which the claim form is preaddressed. When additional medical information is needed, a form for supplemental doctor's statement is sent to the employee. This should be filled out by a doctor and returned to the Board.</P>
            <P>(5) Maternity benefits must be applied for on a form prescribed by the Board. A statement of maternity sickness, executed by a person authorized to execute statements of sickness (see part 335 of this chapter), is required also. The necessary forms may be obtained from a railroad employer, a railway labor organization, or any Board office. An application for maternity benefits (Form SI-101) and the statement of maternity sickness (Form SI-104) may be filed in person or by mail with any Board office. It is important that the statement of maternity sickness be filed promptly since no day can be considered as a day of sickness in a maternity period unless a statement of maternity sickness with respect to the day is filed at an office of the Board within ten days. As in the case of claims for sickness benefits, the forms are forwarded to a regional office. Claim forms are mailed to the claimant and are pre-addressed for return to the regional office.</P>
            <P>(6) Whether benefits are payable to a claimant and, if so, the amount of benefits payable, is determined with respect to claims for unemployment, sickness, and maternity benefits, by the regional office. The names and addresses of claimants to whom benefits are found payable, and the amounts payable to them, are certified to the local disbursing office of the Treasury Department which mails the benefit checks to the claimants. If a claim is denied in whole or in part, an explanation is given to the claimant by letter.</P>
            <P>(7) The rate at which benefits are payable is determined from the claimant's railroad wages earned in a base year period or from his daily pay rate for his last railroad employment in the base year period, whichever will result in the higher benefit rate. His daily benefit rate will be at least 60 per centum of his daily pay rate for his last railroad employment in the base year period, but not exceeding $10.20.</P>

            <P>(8) Any qualified employee whose claim for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act has been denied in whole or in part may, within <PRTPAGE P="183"/>one year from the date such denial is communicated to him, appeal from the initial determination, and such appeal will be heard before an impartial hearings officer. An unsuccessful claimant in an appeal before such hearings officer may appeal to the Board. (For further details of appeals procedure by claimants for benefits and for appeals procedure by employers, see parts 319 and 320 of this chapter.)</P>
            <FP>Any claimant, or any railway labor organization organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, of which the claimant is a member, or any other party aggrieved by a final decision pursuant to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, may, only after all administrative remedies within the Board will have been availed of and exhausted, obtain a review of such final decision of the Board by filing a petition for review within 90 days after the mailing of notice of such decision to the claimant or other party, or within such further time as the Board may allow, in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant or other party resides or will have had his principal place of business or principal executive office, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</FP>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Current compensation and service records.</E> Current compensation and service records are maintained by the Bureau of Research and Employment Accounts. These records are obtained from reports made periodically on either a quarterly or annual basis by employers and employee representatives. General instructions in this regard may be found in part 250 of this chapter. Special instructions to employers and employee representatives are issued from time to time by the Director of Research and Employment Accounts.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Collection of contributions.</E> The Office of Budget and Fiscal Operations acts as the collecting agency of the Board in receiving contributions due under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Contributions are, with some few exceptions, due quarterly and with the payment, the employer must file a report, Form DC-1, Employers Quarterly or Annual Report of Contributions under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. (For further details see part 345 of this chapter.)</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Employment service.</E> Employers needing workers may avail themselves of the Board's employment service by making requests of any field office for referrals, in writing, on forms provided by the Board, or by telephone.</P>

            <P>(e) The copies of manuals and instructions made available for public copying and inspection shall not include:</P>
            <P>(1) Confidential statements, standards, and instructions which do not affect the public, and</P>
            <P>(2) Instructions not affecting the public (such as those relating solely to processing and procedure, to management, or to personnel) which it is feasible to separate from instructions that do affect the public.</P>
            <P>(f) With the exception of records specifically excluded from disclosure by section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, or other applicable statute, any records of or in the custody of this agency, other than those made available under paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section, shall, upon receipt of a written request reasonably describing them, promptly be made available to the person requesting them.</P>
            <P>(g) The RRB may charge the person of persons making a request for records under paragraph (f) of this section a fee in an amount not to exceed the costs actually incurred in complying with the request and not to exceed the cost of processing a check for payment. Depending on the category into which the request falls, a fee may be assessed for the cost of search for documents, reviewing documents to determine whether any portion of any located documents is permitted to be withheld, and duplicating documents.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> To the extent that the following are chargeable, they are chargeable according to the following schedule:</P>
            <P>(i) The charge for making a manual search for records shall be the salary rate, including benefits, for a GS-7, step 5 Federal employee;</P>
            <P>(ii) The charge for reviewing documents to determine whether any portion of any located document is permitted to be withheld shall be the salary rate, including benefits, for a GS-13, step 5 Federal employee;</P>
            <P>(iii) The charge for making photocopies of any size document shall be $.10 per copy per page:</P>

            <P>(iv) The charge for computer-generated listings or labels shall include the direct cost to the RRB of analysis and programming, where required, plus the cost of computer operations to <PRTPAGE P="185"/>produce the listing or labels. The maximum computer search charge shall be $2,250.00 per hour ($37.50 per minute). Search time shall not include the time expended in analysis or programming where these operations are required.</P>
            <P>(v) There shall be no charge for transmitting documents by regular post. The charge for all other methods of transmitting documents shall be the actual cost of transmittal.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Categories of requesters.</E> For the purpose of assessing fees, requesters shall be classified into one of the following five groups:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> Commercial use requesters are requesters who seek information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. For such requesters, the RRB will fully charge for the cost of searching, reviewing and copying and shall not consider a request for waiver or reduction of fees based upon an assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest; however, the RRB will not charge a fee if the total cost for searching, reviewing, and copying is less than $10.00.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> Educational requesters are educational institutions which operate a program or programs of scholarly research. They may be a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education. Non-commercial scientific requesters are institutions that are not operated on a “commercial” basis and which are operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. For requesters in this category, the RRB shall charge for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding the first 100 pages, for which no charge will be made. If after excluding the cost of the first 100 pages of reproduction, there remain costs to be assessed, the RRB will not charge for such costs is such costs total less than $10.00. If the cost is $10.00 or more, the RRB may waive the charge or reduce it if it determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To be eligible for free search time, these requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> The term “representative of the news media” refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that could be of interest to the public. In the case of “freelance” journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. For requesters in this category the RRB shall charge for the cost of reproduction alone excluding the cost of the first 100 pages, for which no charge will be made. If, after excluding the cost of the first 100 pages of reproduction, there remain costs to be assessed, the RRB will not charge for such costs if such costs total less than $10.00. If the cost is $10.00 or more, the RRB may waive the charge or reduce it if it determines that disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To be eligible for free search time, these requesters must reasonably describe the record sought.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Requests by subjects of records in Privacy Act Systems of Records.</E> Requests from subject individuals for records <PRTPAGE P="186"/>about themselves filed in any of the Board's Privacy Act Systems of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1984 which permit assessing fees only for reproduction.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> For requesters who do not fall within the purview of paragraph (g)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the RRB will charge the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request. The RRB will not charge for such costs to be assessed if the total is less than $10.00. If the total is $10.00 or more, the RRB may waive the charge or reduce it if it determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful searches.</E> Where search time is chargeable, the RRB may assess charges for time spent searching, even if the RRB fails to locate the records, or if located, the records are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If the Board estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25.00 it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has agreed in advance to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such notice will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or here needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> When the RRB reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to break a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the RRB will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One element the RRB will consider in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period in which the requests have been.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (i) The RRB estimates or determines that the allowable charges payment unless:</P>
            <P>(A) The RRB estimates or determines that the allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, in which case the RRV will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>
            <P>(B) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), in which case the RRB may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided below of demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>
            <P>(ii) When the Board acts under paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)) (i.e., 10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denials, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the Board has received the fee payments described in said paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> Interest may be charged to any requester who fails to pay fees charged within 30 days fo the date of billing. Interest will be assessed beginning on the 31st day following the day on which the bill for fees was sent. Interest will be the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the U.S. Code Annotated and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Collection of fees due.</E> Whenever it is appropriate in the judgment of the Board in order to encourage repayment of fees billed in accordance with these regulations, the Board will use the procedures authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies.</P>

            <P>(h) Any person or organization requesting records pursuant to this section shall submit such request in writing to the General Counsel, Railroad <PRTPAGE P="187"/>Retirement Board, Room 836, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611-2092. All such requests should be clearly and prominently identified as requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act. If submitted by mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, requests should be clearly and prominently identified as such on the envelope or cover. Requests may also be submitted by e-mail, <E T="03">LAWGroupMailbox@rrb.gov.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The General Counsel, or any other individual specifically authorized to act on behalf of the General Counsel, shall have the authority to grant or deny a request for information submitted under this section. The General Counsel or such authorized representative shall, within 20 working days following the receipt of a request, except as provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, make a determination granting or denying the request and notify the requester of his or her decision, and if a denial, the reasons therefor. The requester shall be further advised that a total or partial denial may be appealed to the Board as provided in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
            <P>(j) In cases where a request for information is denied, in whole or in part, by the General Counsel or his or her authorized representative, the party who originally made the request may appeal such determination to the Board by filing a written appeal with the Secretary of the Board within 20 working days following receipt of the notice of denial. The Board shall render a decision on an appeal within 20 working days following receipt of the appeal except as provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The requester shall promptly be notified of the Board's decision and, in cases where the denial is upheld, of the provisions for judicial review of such final administrative decisions.</P>
            <P>(1) In unusual circumstances, as enumerated in section 552(a)(6)(B) of title 5, United States Code, the time restrictions of paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section may be extended in the aggregate by no more than 10 days by notice to the requester of such extension, the reasons therefor, and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.</P>

            <P>(2) For purposes of paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section, a request shall be received by the General Counsel of the Board when it arrives at the Board's headquarters. <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That when the estimated fee to be assessed for a given request exceeds $30.00, such request shall be deemed not to have been received by the General Counsel until the requester is advised of the estimated cost and agrees to bear it. <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That a request which does not fully comply with all the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section shall be deemed to have been received by the General Counsel on the day it actually reaches his or her office.</P>
            <P>(k) Any person in the employ of the Railroad Retirement Board who receives a request for any information, document or record of this agency, or in the custody thereof, shall advise the requester to address such request to the General Counsel. If the request received is in writing, it shall be immediately referred for action to the Executive Director.</P>
            <P>(l) The General Counsel shall maintain records of:</P>
            <P>(1) The total amount of fees collected by this agency pursuant to this section;</P>
            <P>(2) The number of initial denials of requests for records made pursuant to this section and the reason for each;</P>
            <P>(3) The number of appeals from such denials and the result of each appeal, together with the reason(s) for the action upon each appeal that results in a denial of information;</P>

            <P>(6) Every rule made by this agency affecting or in implementation of section 552 of title 5 U.S. Code;<PRTPAGE P="188"/>

            <P>(8) All other information which indicates efforts to administer fully the letter and spirit of section 552 of title 5 U.S. Code.</P>
            <P>(m) The Board shall, prior to February 1 of each year, prepare and submit a report to the Attorney General of the United States covering each of the categories of records maintained in accordance with the foregoing for the preceding fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Special procedures for handling requests for business information:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) The Freedom of Information Act exempts from mandatory disclosure matters that are “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential * * *.” The Board maintains records that may include information within this exception and to protect the rights of submitters of business information with respect to the confidentiality of such information, all requests for records or information contained in contract bids, contract proposals, contracts, and similar business information documents shall be handled in accordance with the procedures established by this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) When the Executive Director or an individual authorized to grant or deny requests under the Freedom of Information Act receives a request for business information, the General Counsel or other individual shall promptly provide the person who submitted the information to the Board with written notice that a request for the information has been made. The notice shall specify what record or information has been requested and shall inform the business submitter that the submitter may, within ten working days after the date of the notice, file a written objection to disclosure of the information or portions of the information. The written objection to disclosure shall be addressed to the individual whose name appears in the notification and shall specify the portion or portions of the information that the submitter believes should not be disclosed and state the grounds or bases for objecting to disclosure of such portion or portions. No written notice to the business submitter shall be required under this subparagraph if it is readily determined that the information will not be disclosed or that the information has lawfully been published or otherwise made available to the public.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining whether to grant or deny the request for the business information, the official or entity making the determination shall carefully consider any objection to disclosure made by the submitter of the information in question.</P>
            <P>(4) If a determination is made to disclose information with respect to which the business submitter has filed an objection to disclosure, the official or entity making the determination shall, no later than ten working days prior to the date on which disclosure of the information will be made, provide the submitter with written notice of the determination to disclose. The written notice shall state the reasons why the submitter's grounds for objecting to disclosure were rejected and inform the submitter of the date on which the information is to be disclosed.</P>
            <P>(5) The Board shall promptly notify the business submitter of any suit commenced under the Freedom of Information Act to compel disclosure of information which he or she submitted to the Board.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Custom tailored information services; Fees charged.</E> This paragraph and paragraph (p) of this section set forth the policy of the Railroad Retirement Board with respect to the assessment of a fee for providing custom tailored information where requested. Except as provided in paragraphs (o)(4)(vii) and (p) of this section, a fee shall be charged for providing custom tailored information.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Definition: Custom tailored information.</E> Custom tailored information is information not otherwise required to be disclosed under this part but which can be created or extracted and manipulated, reformatted, or otherwise prepared to the specifications of the requester from existing records. For example, the Board needs to program computers to provide data in a particular format or to compile selected items from records, provide statistical <PRTPAGE P="189"/>data, ratios, proportions, percentages, etc. If this data is not already compiled and available, the end product would be the result of custom tailored information services.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Providing custom tailored information.</E> The Board is not required to provide custom tailored information. It will do so only when the appropriate fees have been paid as provided in paragraph (o)(4) of this section and when the request for such information will not divert staff and equipment from the Board's primary responsibilities.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Requesting custom tailored information.</E> Information may be requested in person, by telephone, or by mail. Any request should reasonably describe the information wanted and may be sent to the Director of Administration, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611-2092.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> Requests for custom tailored information are chargeable according to the following schedule:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Manual searching for records.</E> Full cost of the time of the employees who perform the service, even if records cannot be found, management and supervisory costs, plus the full costs of any machine time and materials the employee uses. Consulting and other indirect costs will be assessed as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Photocopying or reproducing records on magnetic tapes or computer diskettes.</E> The charge for making photocopies of any size document shall be $.10 per copy per page. The charge for reproducing records on magnetic tapes or computer diskettes is the full cost of the operator's time plus the full cost of the machine time and the materials used.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Protection of privacy of records maintained on individuals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> The purpose of this section is to establish specific procedures necessary for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579). These regulations apply to all record systems containing information of a personal or private nature maintained by the Railroad Retirement Board that are indexed and retrieved by personal identifier.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Individual.</E> The term “individual” pertains to a natural person who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and not to a company or corporation.<PRTPAGE P="190"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">System of records.</E> For the purposes of this section, the term “system of records” pertains to only those records that can be retrieved by an individual identifier.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Railroad Retirement Board.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “Railroad Retirement Board” refers to the United States Railroad Retirement Board, an independent agency in the executive branch of the United States Government.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Board.</E> For purposes of this section the term “Board” refers to the three member governing body of the United States Railroad Retirement Board.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure for requesting the existence of personally identifiable records in a record system.</E> An individual can determine if a particular record system maintained by the Railroad Retirement Board contains any record pertaining to him by submitting a written request for such information to the system manager of that record system as described in the annual notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> A current copy of the system notices, published in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, is available for inspection at all regional and district offices of the Board. If necessary, Board personnel will aid requesters in determining what system(s) of records they wish to review and will forward any requests for information to the appropriate system manager. Also, requests for personal information may be submitted either by mail or in person to the system manager at the headquarters of the Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. Prior to responding to a request for information under this subsection, the system manager shall require the individual requesting such information to provide identifying data, such as his full name, date of birth, and social security number. The system manager shall respond to a request under this subsection within a reasonable time by stating that a record on the individual either is or is not contained in the system.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Disclosure of requested information to individuals.</E> (1) Upon request, an individual shall be granted access to records pertaining to himself, other than medical records and records compiled in anticipation of a civil or criminal action or proceeding against him, which are indexed by individual identifier in a particular system of records. Requests for access must be in writing and should be addressed to the system manager of that record system as described in the annual notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Requests under this subsection may be submitted either by mail or in person at the headquarters offices of the Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.</P>
            <P>(2) The system manager shall, within ten working days following the date on which the request is received in his office, render a decision either granting or denying access and shall promptly notify the individual of his decision. If the request is denied, the notification shall inform the individual of his right to appeal the denial to the Board. An individual whose request for access under this subsection has been denied by the system manager may appeal that determination to the Board by filing a written appeal with the Secretary of the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611 within twenty working days following receipt of the notice of denial. The Board shall render a decision on an appeal within thirty working days following the date on which the appeal is received in the office of the Secretary of the Board. The individual shall promptly be notified of the Board's decision.</P>
            <P>(3) In cases where an individual has been granted access to his records, the system manager shall, prior to releasing such records, require the individual to produce identifying data such as his name, date of birth, and social security number.</P>
            <P>(4) Disclosure to an individual of his record may be made by providing him, upon written request therefor, a copy of the record or portion thereof which he reasonably describes in his request.</P>

            <P>(5) An individual, and if such individual so desires, one other person of his choosing, may review and have a copy made of his record (in a form comprehensible to him) during regular business hours at the location described as the repository of the record system containing such records in the <PRTPAGE P="191"/>annual notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or at such other location convenient to the individual as specified by the system manager. If an individual is accompanied by another person, the system manager may require written authorizations for disclosure in the presence of the other person from the individual before any record or portion thereof is released.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Special procedures—medical records.</E> (1) An individual concerning whom the Railroad Retirement Board maintains medical records in a system of records shall, upon written request, be permitted to review such medical records or be furnished copies of such records if the system manager of the system containing the requested records determines that disclosure of the records or any portion thereof would not be harmful to the individual's mental or physical health.</P>
            <P>(2) If, upon review of the medical records requested, the system manager determines that disclosure of such records or any portion thereof might be harmful to the individual's mental or physical health, he shall inform the individual that copies of the records may be furnished to a physician of the individual's own choosing. If the individual should select a physician to conduct such a review and direct the Board to permit the physician to review the records, the system manger shall promptly forward copies of the records in question to that physician. The system manger shall inform the physician that the records are being provided to him or her for the purpose of making an independent determination as to whether release or the records directly to the individual who has requested them might be harmful to that individual. The physician shall be informed that if, in his or her opinion, direct disclosure of the records would not be harmful to the individual's mental or physical health, he or she may then provide the copies to the individual. The physician shall further be informed that should he or she determine that disclosure of the records in question might be harmful to the individual, such records shall not be disclosed and should be returned to the Board, but the physician may summarize and discuss the contents of the records with the individual.</P>
            <P>(3) The special procedure established by paragraph (e) of this section to permit an individual access to medical records pertaining to himself or herself shall not be construed as authorizing the individual to direct the Board to disclose such medical records to any third parties, other than to a physician in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Medical records shall not be disclosed by the Board to any entities or persons other than the individual to whom the record pertains or his or her authorized physician regardless of consent, except as permissible under paragraphs (j)(1)(i), (iii), and (viii) of this section and as provided under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1), (2) and (3) of this section and of paragraph (d) of this section, if a determination made with respect to an individual's claim for benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is based in whole or in part on medical records, disclosure of or access to such medical records shall be granted to such individual or to such individual's representative when such records are requested for the purpose of contesting such determination either administratively of judicially.</P>
            <P>(5) The procedures for access to medical records set forth in paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply with respect to requests for access to an individual's disability decision sheet or similar adjudicatory documents, access to which is governed solely by paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">General exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Systems of records subject to investigatory material exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</E> RRB-43, Investigation Files, a system containing information concerning alleged violations of law, regulation, or rule pertinent to the administration of programs by the RRB or alleging misconduct or conflict of interest on the part of RRB employees in the discharge of their official duties.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Scope of exemption.</E> (i) The system of records identified in this paragraph is maintained by the Office of Investigations (OI) of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), a component of the <PRTPAGE P="192"/>Board which performs as its principal function activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Authority for the criminal law enforcement activities of the OIG's OI is the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App.</P>
            <P>(ii) Applicable information in the system of records described in this paragraph is exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G), (H), and (I), (5), and (8), (Agency Requirements), (f) (Agency Rules) and (g) (Civil Remedies) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</P>
            <P>(iii) To the extent that information in this system of records does not fall within the scope of this general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552(j)(2) for any reason, the specific exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(2) is claimed for such information. (See paragraph (g) of this section.)</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reasons for exemptions.</E> The system of records described in this section is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make available to the individual named in the records, at his or her request, an accounting of each disclosure of records. This accounting must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. Accounting of each disclosure would alert the subjects of an investigation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjects of an investigation. The release of such information to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, and could seriously impede or compromise the investigation and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.</P>
            <P>(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since the RRB is claiming that this system of records is exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, this section is inapplicable and is exempted to the extent that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records pertaining to him or her, to request amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to contest the information contained in such records. Granting access to records in this system of records could inform the subject of the investigation of an actual or potential criminal violation of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his or her activities, of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and could provide information to enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Granting access to such information could seriously impede or compromise an investigation, lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony, and disclose investigative techniques and procedures.</P>
            <P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President. The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement, because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of an investigation. Relevance and necessity are often questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established.</P>

            <P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement by alerting the subject of an investigation of the existence of the investigation, enabling <PRTPAGE P="193"/>the subject to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Moreover, in certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators, and information must be collected from other sources. Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect information from sources other than the subject of the investigation to verify the accuracy of the evidence collected.</P>
            <P>(vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by the person, of the authority under which the information is sought and whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; of the routine uses which may be made of the information; and of the effects on the person, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information. The application of this provision could provide the subject of an investigation with substantial information about the nature of that investigation.</P>

            <P>(vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) require an agency to publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice concerning its procedures for notifying an individual at his request if the system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her, how he or she can gain access to such a record, and how he or she can contest its contents. Since the RRB is claiming that the system of records is exempt from subsection (f) of the Act, concerning agency rules, and subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, these requirements are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsections (f) and (d) of the Act. Although the RRB is claiming exemption from these requirements, RRB has published such a notice concerning its notification, access, and contest procedures because, under certain circumstances, RRB might decide it is appropriate for an individual to have access to all or a portion of his or her records in this system of records.</P>

            <P>(viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice concerning the categories of sources or records in the system of records. Exemption from this provision is necessary to protect the confidentiality of the sources of information, to protect the privacy of confidential sources and witnesses, and to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques and procedures. Although RRB is claiming exemption from this requirement, RRB has published such a notice in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires.</P>
            <P>(ix) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any determination about the individual. Since the Act defines “maintain” to include the collection of information, complying with this provision would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In collecting information for criminal law enforcement purposes, it is not possible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Facts are first gathered and then placed into a logical order to prove or disprove objectively the criminal behavior of an individual. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as the investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report, thereby impending effective law enforcement.</P>
            <P>(x) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. Complying with this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.</P>

            <P>(xi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1) requires an agency to promulgate rules which shall establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified in response to his or her request if any system of <PRTPAGE P="194"/>records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him or her. The application of this provision could impede or compromise an investigation or prosecution if the subject of an investigation was able to use such rules to learn of the existence of an investigation before it could be completed. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others that their activities are under or may become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Since the RRB is claiming that these systems of records are exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, the requirements of subsections (f)(2) through (5) of the Act, concerning agency rules for obtaining access to such records, are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d) of the Act. Although RRB is claiming exemption from the requirements of subsection (f) of the Act, RRB has promulgated rules which establish Agency procedures because, under certain circumstances, it might be appropriate for an individual to have access to all or a portion of his or her records in this system of records. These procedures are described elsewhere in this part.</P>
            <P>(xii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the requirements concerning access to records under subsections (d)(1) and (3) of the Act; maintenance of records under subsection (e)(5) of the Act; and any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. Since the RRB is claiming that this system of records is exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G), (H), and (I), (5), and (8), and (f) of the Act, the provisions of subsection (g) of the Act are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent that this system or records is exempted from those subsections of the Act.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Specific exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Systems of records subject to investigatory material exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k</E>)(<E T="03">2</E>). RRB-43, Investigation Files, a system containing information concerning alleged violations of law, regulation, or rule pertinent to the administration of programs by the RRB or alleging misconduct or conflict of interest on the part of RRB employees in the discharge of their official duties.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Privacy Act provisions from which exempt.</E> The system of records described in this paragraph is exempt from subsections (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(1), 4G, H, and I (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reasons for exemptions.</E> The system of records described in this section is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(i) To prevent the subject of the investigations from frustrating the investigatory process.</P>
            <P>(ii) To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.</P>
            <P>(iii) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of sources and to maintain access to necessary sources of information.</P>
            <P>(iv) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Request for amendment of a record.</E> (1) An individual may request that a record pertaining to himself be amended by submitting a written request for such amendment to the system manager as described in the annual notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Requests under this subsection may be made either by mail or in person at the headquarters offices of the Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. Such a request should include a statement of the information in the record which the individual believes is incorrect, a statement of any information not in the record which the individual believes would correct the record, if included, and a statement of any evidence which substantiates the individual's belief concerning the inaccuracy of the information presently contained in the record.</P>

            <P>(2) Prior to rendering a determination in response to a request under this subsection, the system manager shall require that the individual provide identifying data such as his name, date of birth, and social security number.<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The system manager responsible for the system of records which contains the challenged record shall acknowledge receipt of the request in writing within ten working days following the date on which the request for amendment was received in his office and shall promptly render a decision either granting or denying the request.</P>
            <P>(i) If the system manager grants the individual's request to amend his record, the system manager shall amend the record accordingly, advise the individual in writing that the requested amendment has been made and where an accounting of disclosures has been made, advise all previous recipients of the record to whom disclosure of such record was made and accounted for of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the system manager denies the individual's request to amend his record, the system manager shall inform the individual that the request has been denied in whole or in part, the reason for the denial and the procedure regarding the individual's right to appeal the denial to the Board.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal of initial adverse determination on amendment.</E> (1) An individual, whose request for amendment of a record pertaining to him is denied, may appeal that determination to the Board by filing a written appeal with the Secretary of the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. The written notice of appeal should include a statement of the information in the record which the individual believes is correct, a statement of any information not in the record which the individual believes would correct the record, if included, and a statement of any evidence which substantiates the individual's belief concerning the inaccuracy of the information presently contained in the record.</P>
            <P>(2) The Board shall consider the appeal and render a final decision thereon within thirty working days following the date on which the appeal is received in the office of the Secretary of the Board. An extension of the thirty day response period is permitted for a good cause upon notification of such to the requester.</P>
            <P>(3) If, upon consideration of the appeal, the Board upholds the denial, the appellant shall be so informed in writing. The appellant shall be advised that he may file a concise statement with the Board setting forth his reasons for disagreeing with the Board's decision and the procedures to be followed in filing such a statement of disagreement. The individual shall also be informed of his right to judicial review as provided under section 552a(g)(1)(A) of title 5 of the United States Code. If disclosure has or will be made of a record containing information about which an individual has filed a statement of disagreement, that contested information will be annotated and a copy of the statement of disagreement will be provided to past and future recipients of the information along with which the Board may include a statement of its reasons for not amending the record in question.</P>
            <P>(4) If, upon consideration of the appeal, the Board reverses the denial, the Board shall amend the record, advise the appellant in writing that such amendment has been made, and where an accounting of disclosures has been made, advise all previous recipients of the record to whom disclosure of such was made and accounted for, of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Disclosure of record to person other than the individual to whom it pertains.</E> (1) Records collected and maintained by the Railroad Retirement Board in the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act which contain information of a personal or private nature shall not be disclosed to any person or to another agency without the express written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. Such written consent shall not be required if the disclosure is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation and is:</P>
            <P>(i) To officers or employees of the Railroad Retirement Board who, in the performance of their official duties, have a need for the record;</P>

            <P>(2) Where agency business is disposed of by notational voting as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the minutes of the next succeeding Board meeting shall reflect such action.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) Except as provided in this section, every portion of every meeting of the Board shall be open to the public. A meeting or a portion of a meeting may be closed where (i) the Board properly determines that the subject matter of the meeting or portion thereof is such as to make it likely that disclosure of matters falling within one or more of the exceptions set out in paragraph (c)(3) of this section would result, and (ii) the Board determines that the public interest would not require that the meeting or portion thereof be open to the public.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall not apply to information pertaining to a meeting which would otherwise be required to be disclosed to the public under this section where the Board properly determines that the disclosure of the information is likely to disclose matters within the exceptions listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and that the public interest would not require that the matters, even though excepted, should be disclosed.</P>

            <P>(v) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;</P>
            <P>(vi) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(vii) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would</P>
            <P>(A) Interfere with law enforcement proceedings,</P>
            <P>(B) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,</P>
            <P>(C) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>
            <P>(D) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source,</P>
            <P>(E) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or</P>
            <P>(F) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>
            <P>(viii) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Board action, except that this paragraph shall not apply in any instance where the Board has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Board is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final agency action on such proposal; or</P>
            <P>(ix) Specifically concern the agency's issuance of a subpoena, or the agency's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the agency of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the authority granted in 45 U.S.C. 231f and 45 U.S.C. 365.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Any action by the Board to close a meeting or a portion thereof, or to withhold any information pertaining to such meeting or portion thereof, shall be taken only upon the vote of at least two members of the Board that the meeting or portion thereof be closed or information withheld for one or more of the reasons set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, to close the meetings or portions thereof or to withhold information pertaining to such meetings, where the meetings or portions thereof involve the same subject matter and are scheduled within 30 calendar days after the date of the initial meeting in the series.</P>
            <P>(2) The vote of each member of the Board participating in the vote on closure of a meeting or portion thereof shall be recorded. Vote by proxy shall not be allowed.</P>

            <P>(3) A person whose interests might be directly affected by a meeting or portion thereof which otherwise would be open may request that the meeting or portion thereof which concerns such <PRTPAGE P="200"/>person's interests be closed under paragraphs (c)(3)(v), (vi), or (vii) of this section. The request should be directed to The Secretary, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, and must be received no later than the beginning of the meeting to which it applies. Upon receipt of such a request the Board shall vote by recorded vote on the question as to whether the meeting or portion thereof should be closed.</P>
            <P>(4) Within one day following a vote taken under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, a copy of such vote showing the vote of each member shall be available for public inspection and copying in the office of the Secretary of the Board, located in the Board's headquarters office.</P>
            <P>(5) If a meeting or portion thereof is closed in accordance with an action under paragraphs (d)(2) or (3) of this section, the Board shall, within one day following the vote, except to the extent such information is exempt from disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, make available for inspection and copying in the office of the Secretary of the Board a written explanation of the Board's action and a list of the persons expected to attend and their affiliations.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) Except as to those meetings or portions of meetings scheduled as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the Board shall for each meeting make public announcement at least one week prior thereto of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, whether the meeting is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and telephone number of an official of the Railroad Retirement Board designated by the Board to respond to any requests from the public pertaining to the meeting.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirement contained in paragraph (e)(1) of this section that the Board give one week advance notice of each meeting shall not apply where the Board determines by majority vote, which vote shall be recorded, that agency business requires that a meeting be scheduled at an earlier date. If a meeting is scheduled less than one week in the future, as provided in this paragraph, the Board shall make a public announcement at the earliest practicable time of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting and whether the meeting is to be open or closed to the public.</P>
            <P>(3) The Board may change the time and place of a previously scheduled and announced meeting, but such change must be announced to the public at the earliest practicable time. The Board may change the subject matter, or its determination to open or close a meeting or portion thereof, of a previously scheduled and announced meeting only if (i) a majority of the Board determines by recorded vote that agency business requires the change and that no earlier public announcement of the change was possible, and (ii) the Board makes a public announcement of the change and the vote of each member thereon at the earliest practicable time.</P>

            <P>(4) Immediately following each public announcement required by this subsection, the Board shall submit for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether the meeting is to be open or closed, any changes in such items from a previous announcement, and the name and telephone number of the Railroad Retirement Board official designated by the Board to respond to requests concerning the announced meeting.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) Whenever the Board should determine to close a meeting or a portion of a meeting under any of the exemptions contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the General Counsel of the Railroad Retirement Board shall, prior to the meeting, certify in writing that in his or her opinion the meeting or portion thereof may be closed to the public and shall state the applicable exemptions which permit closure. The Board shall maintain a copy of the General Counsel's certification and a copy of the statement of the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting and a list of the persons present, other than those present merely as spectators.</P>

            <P>(2) In the event that a meeting or any portion of a meeting is closed to the public, a complete transcript or recording shall be made of the meeting or portion thereof closed; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the meeting or portion <PRTPAGE P="201"/>thereof is closed under paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section, a set of minutes may be made of the closed meeting or portion of a meeting in lieu of a complete transcript or recording thereof. If a set of minutes is the method chosen to record the proceedings of a meeting or portion thereof closed under paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section, such minutes shall fully and clearly describe the matters discussed. The minutes shall also fully reflect any actions taken by the Board, set forth a statement of the reasons for such actions, summarize each of the views expressed concerning such actions, identify any documents considered in connection with such agency actions, and show the vote of the Board and each of its members on such actions.</P>
            <P>(3) The transcript, recording, or minutes of each meeting or portion thereof closed to the public shall be available for public inspection or listening in the office of the Secretary of the Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, no later than two weeks following the meeting. There shall be expunged or erased from the transcript, recording, or minutes of each meeting which is made available to the public any items of discussion or testimony when it has been determined that they contain information which may be withheld under paragraph (c) of this section, and that the public interest would not require disclosure. The determination as to what items of discussion or testimony shall be expunged or erased from the copies of the transcript, recording, or minutes available to the public shall be made by the Secretary of the Board with the approval of the Board.</P>
            <P>(4) Copies of transcripts, minutes, or transcriptions of recordings maintained by the Board as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall be provided to members of the public who request such copies, at the actual cost of duplicating or transcription. Requests for copies of transcripts, minutes or transcriptions of recordings should be in writing, addressed to the Secretary of the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, and should clearly indicate the date of the meeting or meetings for which such copies are requested. If the requester desires a copy of only a portion or portions of the transcript, minutes, or transcription of a specified meeting, the request should specify which portion or portions are desired.</P>
            <P>(5) The Board shall maintain the complete transcript, recording, or minutes required to be made under paragraph (e)(2) of this section for a period of at least two years after the meeting, or for at least one year after the conclusion of any agency proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion of the meeting was held, whichever occurs later.</P>
            <P>(g) Nothing in this section shall expand or limit the rights of any person under 5 U.S.C. 552, and 20 CFR 200.3, except that the exemptions contained in paragraph (c) of this section shall govern in the case of any request under 5 U.S.C. 552 and 20 CFR 200.3 to copy, inspect, or obtain copies of transcripts, recordings, or minutes described in paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of any individual under 5 U.S.C. 552a and 20 CFR 200.4 to gain access to any record which would be available to such individual under those provisions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assessment or waiver of interest, penalties, and administrative costs with respect to collection of certain debts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Debt Collection Act of 1982 requires the Board to charge interest on claims for money owed the Board, to assess penalties on delinquent debts, and to assess charges to cover the costs of processing claims for delinquent debts. The Act permits, and in certain cases requires, an agency to waive the collection of interest, penalties and charges under circumstances which comply with standards enunciated jointly by the Comptroller General and the Attorney General. Those standards are contained in 4 CFR 102.13. This section contains the circumstances under which the Board may either assess or waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs which arise from benefit or annuity overpayments made under any of the Acts which the Board administers.<PRTPAGE P="202"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b)(1) Simple interest shall be assessed once a month on the unpaid principal of a debt.</P>
            <P>(2) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt and demand for repayment with interest is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor, or in the case of a debt which is subject to section 10(c) of the Railroad Retirement Act or section 2(d) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, interest shall accrue from the date that a denial of waiver of recovery is mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor or, if waiver has not been requested, upon the expiration of the time within which to request waiver, except as otherwise specified in this section.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of a lien for reimbursement of sickness benefits pursuant to part 341 of this chapter, interest on the amount of the lien shall accrue from the date of settlement or the entry of final judgment.</P>

            <P>(4) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the Treasury Financial Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
            <P>(5) The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except that where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, a new interest rate may be assessed.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) A penalty charge of 6 percent per year shall be assessed on any debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</P>
            <P>(2) The penalty charge shall accrue from the date on which the debt became delinquent.</P>
            <P>(3) A debt is delinquent if it has not been paid in full by the 30th day after the date on which the initial demand letter was first mailed or hand-delivered, or, if the debt is being repaid under an installment payment agreement, at any time after the debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation for payment thereunder.</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of a lien for reimbursement of sickness benefits pursuant to part 341 of this chapter, the amount of the lien is delinquent if it has not been paid in full by the 30th day after the date of settlement or entry of final judgment.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Charges shall be assessed against the debtor for administrative costs incurred as a result of processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent.</P>
            <P>(2) Administrative costs include costs incurred in obtaining a credit report and in using a private debt collector.</P>
            <P>(e) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal. Where a debtor is in default under an installment repayment agreement, uncollected interest, penalties and administrative cost charges which have accrued under the agreement shall be added to the principal to be paid under any new installment repayment agreement entered into between the Board and the debtor.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> The assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs under this section does not apply to debts under sections 2(f) and 8(g) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 352(f) and 358(g)).</P>
            <P>(g)(1) The Board shall waive the collection of interest under the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(i) When the debt is paid within thirty days after the date on which notice of the debt was mailed or personally delivered to the debtor,</P>
            <P>(ii) When, in any case where a decision with respect to waiver of recovery of an overpayment must be made:</P>
            <P>(A) The debt is paid within thirty days after the end of the period within which the debtor may request waiver of recovery, if no request for waiver is received within the prescribed time period; or</P>

            <P>(B) The debt is paid within thirty days after the date on which notice was mailed to the debtor that his or her request for waiver of recovery has been wholly or partially denied if the debtor requested waiver of recovery within the prescribed time limit; however, regardless of when the debt is paid, no interest may be charged for any period prior to the end of the period within <PRTPAGE P="203"/>which the debtor may request waiver of recovery or, if such request is made, for any period prior to the date on which notice was mailed to the debtor that his or her request for waiver of recovery has been wholly or partially denied;</P>
            <P>(iii) When, in the situations described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the debt is paid within any extension of the thirty-day period granted by the Board;</P>
            <P>(iv) With respect to any portion of the debt which is paid within the time limits described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i), (g)(1)(ii), or (g)(1)(iii) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(v) In regard to any debt the recovery of which is waived.</P>
            <P>(2) The Board may waive the collection of interest, penalties and administrative costs in whole or in part in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(i) Where, in the judgment of the Board, collecting interest, penalty and administrative costs would be against equity and good conscience; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Where, in the judgment of the Board, collecting interest, penalty and administrative costs would not be in the best interest of the United States.</P>
            <P>(h)(1) In making determinations as to when the collection of interest, penalty and administrative costs is against equity and good conscience the Board will consider evidence on the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The fault of the overpaid individual in causing the underlying overpayment; and</P>

              <E T="03">Information.</E> The term <E T="03">information</E> means any non-medical document or <PRTPAGE P="204"/>data which is obtained by the agency in the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act and/or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. <E T="03">Information</E> does not include the fact of entitlement to or the amount of a benefit under either of these Acts. Medical records are subject to the disclosure provisions set out in § 200.5(e) of this part.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Testify and testimony.</E> The terms <E T="03">testify</E> and <E T="03">testimony</E> include both in-person oral statements before a court or a legislative or administrative body and statements made in the form of depositions, interrogatories, declarations, affidavits or other means of formal participation in such proceedings.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as otherwise authorized by this section, information shall not be produced, disclosed, delivered or open to inspection in any manner revealing the identity of an employee, applicant or beneficiary unless the Board or its authorized designee finds that such production, disclosure, delivery, or inspection is clearly in furtherance of the interest of the employee, applicant or beneficiary or of the estate of such employee, applicant, or beneficiary. Where no such finding is made, no information shall be released except in accordance with the provisions of § 200.5 of this part, unless release of such information is required by a law determined to supersede this general rule. In addition, regardless of whether or not such finding can be made, information which is compiled in anticipation of a civil or criminal action or proceeding against an applicant or beneficiary may not be released under this general rule.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Subpoenas—statement of policy and general rule.</E> (1) It is the policy of the Board to provide information, data, and records to non-Federal litigants to the same extent and in the same manner that they are available to the general public. The availability of Board employees to testify before state and local courts and administrative and legislative bodies, as well as in Federal court and administrative proceedings which involve non-Federal litigants, concerning information acquired in the course of performing their official duties or because of the employee's official capacity, is governed by the Board's policy of maintaining strict impartiality with respect to private litigants and minimizing the disruption of an employee's official duties. Thus, the Board may refuse to make an employee available for testimony under this paragraph or paragraph (e) or (f) of this section if it determines that the information sought is available other than through testimony and where making such employee available would cause disruption of agency operations. However, this paragraph does not apply to any civil or criminal proceeding where the United States, the Railroad Retirement Board, or any other Federal agency is a party; to Congressional requests or subpoenas for testimony; to consultative services and technical assistance provided by the Board or the agency in carrying out its normal program activities; to employees serving as expert witnesses in connection with professional and consultative services rendered as approved outside activities (in cases where employees are providing such outside services, they must state for the record that the testimony represents their own views and does not necessarily represent the official position of the agency); or to employees making appearances in their private capacity in legal or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the official business of the agency (such as cases arising out of traffic accidents, crimes, domestic relations, etc.) and not involving professional and consultative services as described above.</P>
            <P>(2) No officer, agent, or employee of the agency is authorized to accept or receive service of subpoenas, summons, or other judicial process addressed to the Board or to the agency except as the Board may from time to time delegate such authority by power of attorney. The Board has issued such power of attorney to the Deputy General Counsel of the agency and to no one else.</P>

            <P>(3) In the event the production, disclosure, or delivery of any information is called for on behalf of the United States or the agency, such information shall be produced, disclosed, or delivered only upon and pursuant to the advice of the Deputy General Counsel.<PRTPAGE P="205"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) When any member, officer, agent, or employee of the agency is served with a subpoena to produce, disclose, deliver, or furnish any information, he or she shall immediately notify the Deputy General Counsel of the fact of the service of such subpoena. Unless otherwise ordered by the Deputy General Counsel or his or her designee, he or she shall appear in response to the subpoena and respectfully decline to produce, disclose, deliver, or furnish the information, basing such refusal upon the authority of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Subpoena duces tecum.</E> (1) When any document is sought from the agency by a subpoena duces tecum or other judicial order issued to the agency by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding wherein such document is relevant, a copy of such document, certified by the Secretary to the Board to be a true copy, may be produced, disclosed, or delivered by the agency if, in the judgment of the Board or its designee, such production is clearly in furtherance of the interest of the employee, applicant, or beneficiary to whom the document pertains, or is clearly in furtherance of the interest of the estate of such employee, applicant, or beneficiary, and such document does not consist of or include a report of medical information.</P>
            <P>(2) When the production, diclosure, or delivery of any document described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section would not be permitted under the standards therein set forth, no member, officer, agent, or employee of the agency shall make any disclosure of or testify with respect to such document.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Requests for voluntary testimony.</E> All requests for testimony by a Board employee in his or her official capacity must be in writing and directed to the Deputy General Counsel. They shall state the nature of the requested testimony, why the information is not available by any other means, and the reasons, if any, why the testimony would be in the interest of the Board or the Federal government.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Authorized release of information.</E> Subject to the limitation expressed in paragraph (h) of this section, disclosure of documents and information is hereby authorized, in such manner as the Board may by instructions prescribe, in the following cases:</P>
            <P>(1) To any employer, employee, applicant, or prospective applicant for an annuity or death benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or his or her duly authorized representative, as to matters directly concerning such employer, employee, applicant, or prospective applicant in connection with the administration of such Act.</P>
            <P>(2) To any employer, employee, applicant or prospective applicant for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, or his or her duly authorized representative, as to matters directly concerning such employer, employee, applicant, or prospective applicant in connection with the administration of such Act.</P>

            <P>(4) To any applicant or prospective applicant for death benefits or accrued annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act, or to his or her duly authorized representative, as to the amount payable as such death benefits or accrued annuities, and the name of the person or persons determined by the agency to be the beneficiary, or beneficiaries, thereof, if such applicant or prospective applicant purports to have a valid reason for believing himself or herself to be, in whole or in part, the beneficiary thereof.</P>
            <P>(5) To any officer or employee of the United States lawfully charged with the administration of any Federal law concerning taxes imposed with respect to amounts payable under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and the name of the person or persons to whom such amount was payable.</P>

            <P>(6) To any officer or employee of any state of the United States lawfully charged with the administration of any law of such state concerning unemployment compensation, as to the amounts payable to payees or beneficiaries under the Railroad Retirement Act of <PRTPAGE P="206"/>1974 and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
            <P>(7) To any court of competent jurisdiction in which proceedings are pending which relate to the care of the person or estate of an incompetent individual, as to amounts payable under the Railroad Retirement Act to such incompetent individual, but only for the purpose of such proceedings.</P>
            <P>(8) To parties involved in litigation, including an action with respect to child support, alimony, or marital property, the amount of any actual or estimated benefit payable under the Railroad Retirement Act or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, where such amount or estimated amount is relevant to that litigation.</P>
            <P>(9) To any employer, as to the monthly amount of any retirement annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 or benefit under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to which a present or former employee of that employer is entitled.</P>
            <P>(10) To any governmental welfare agency, information about the receipt of benefits and eligibility for benefits.</P>
            <P>(11) To any law enforcement agency, information necessary to investigate or prosecute criminal activity in connection with claims for benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, or any other Act the Board may be authorized to administer.</P>
            <P>(12) To any consular official, other than a consular officer of a country to which United States Treasury checks and warrants may not be sent, acting in behalf of a compatriot who has claimed benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act or Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, information that is pertinent to the claim and that the applicant himself could have upon his or her own request.</P>
            <P>(h) No document and no information acquired solely by reason of any agreement, arrangement, contract, or request by or on behalf of the agency, relating to the gathering, preparation, receipt or transmittal of documents or information to, from or for the agency, which is by virtue of such agreement, arrangement, contract, or request in the possession of any person other than an employee of the agency, shall be produced, reproduced, or duplicated, disclosed or delivered by any person to any other person or tribunal (other than the agency or an employee thereof, or the person to whom the document or information pertains), whether in response to a subpoena or otherwise, except with the consent of the Board or its designee. Any person, upon receipt of any request, subpoena, or order calling for the production, disclosure, or delivery of such document or information shall notify the Board or its designee of the request, subpoena, or order and shall take no further action except upon advice of the Board or its designee. Unless consent of the Board or its designee is given, the person shall respectfully decline to comply with the request, subpoena or order.</P>
            <P>(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no disclosure of information may be made by the Board or any member, officer, agent, or employee of the agency, if the disclosure of such information is prohibited by law.</P>
            <P>(j) The Deputy General Counsel or his designee will request the assistance of the Department of Justice where necessary to represent the interests of the agency and its employees under this section.</P>

            <P>(a) With respect to any company or person principally engaged in business other than carrier business, but which, in addition to such principal business, engages in some carrier business, the Board will require submission of information pertaining to the history and all operations of such company or person with a view to determining whether some identifiable and separable enterprise conducted by the person or company is to be considered to be the employer. The determination will be made in the light of considerations such as the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The primary purpose of the company or person on and since the date it was established;</P>

            <P>A receiver, trustee, or other individual or body, judicial or otherwise, in the possession of the property or operating all or any part of the business of a carrier, or of a company or person owned or controlled by or under common control with such a carrier, which operates any equipment or facility or performs any service in connection with the transportation of passengers or property by railroad, shall be deemed to be an employer beginning as of whichever of the following three dates is the earliest:</P>
            <P>(a) The date that it takes possession of such property; or</P>
            <P>(b) The first date on which it has authority to operate all or any part of the business of such a carrier, company or person; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Evidence of termination of employer status.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining whether a cessation of an essential characteristic, such as control or service in connection with railroad transportation, has occurred, consideration will be given only to those events or actions which evidence a final or complete cessation. Mere temporary periods of inactivity or failure to exercise functions or to operate equipment or facilities will not necessarily result in a loss of employer status.</P>
            <P>(b) The actual date of cessation of employer status shall be the date upon which final or complete cessation of an essential employer characteristic occurs. The following indicate but do not delimit the type of evidence that will be considered in determining the actual date of cessation of an employer status: stoppage of business or operations; the cancellation of tariffs, concurrences, or powers of attorney filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission; the effective date of a certificate permitting abandonment; the effective date of a pertinent judicial action such as the discharge of a receiver, trustee, or other judicial officer, or an order approving sale of equipment or machinery; the sale, transfer, or lease of property, equipment, or machinery essential to the continuance of an employer function or to control by a carrier employer; public or private notices of contemplated or scheduled abandonment or cessation of operations; termination of contract; discharge of last employee; date upon which the right of a railway labor organization to participate in the selection of labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board ceases or is denied; and date on which an employer, if a labor organization, ceases to represent or is denied the right to represent crafts or classes of employees in the railroad industry, or to promote the interests of employees in the railroad industry.</P>

            <P>(c) In the absence of evidence to the contrary the employer status of an existing company or person shall be presumed to continue, and in accordance with § 250.1(b) of this chapter it is the <PRTPAGE P="212"/>duty of each employer promptly to notify the Board of any change in operations affecting such company's status as an employer.</P>

            <P>(a) The Deputy General Counsel will require the submission of information pertaining to the history and operations of an electric railway with a view to determining whether it is an employer and will inquire into and make his recommendations upon the following considerations:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the electric railway is more than a street, suburban or interurban electric railway; or</P>
            <P>(2) Whether it is operating as a part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation; or</P>
            <P>(3) Whether it is part of the national transportation system.</P>
            <P>(b) If in the opinion of the Deputy General Counsel an electric railway has the characteristic set forth in either paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (a)(3) of this section, he will conclude that it is an employer under the act and if the operator concurs in such opinion, the decision will be made final by the Board. If the operator does not concur in the conclusion reached the question will be submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission for determination.</P>

            <P>An organization, association, bureau or agency is performing a service in connection with or incidental to railroad transportation whenever it is engaged in the performance of functions which would normally be performed by the constituent employers in the absence of such organization, association, bureau, or agency.</P>

            <P>Railway labor organizations, national in scope, which have been or may be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and their State and National legislative committees and their general committees and their insurance departments and their local lodges and divisions, established pursuant to the constitution and bylaws of such organizations, shall be employers within the meaning of the act.</P>

            <P>(a) An organization doing business on or after June 21, 1934, which establishes, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section a right, under section 3 “First” (a) of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (48 Stat. 1189; 45 U.S.C. 153 “First” (a)), to participate in the selection of labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, will be presumed, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, to be, from and after the date on which such right is thus established, a labor organization, national in scope and organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended. Such an organization can establish that it is an employer by establishing, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, that, as a labor organization, national in scope and organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, it is a “railway” organization. An organization, doing business on or after June 21, 1934, which has not established such a right of participation, will be presumed not to be a labor organization, national in scope and organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and such presumption can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence satisfactory to the Board showing that the reasons for the organization's failure to establish such a right have no relation to its being a labor organization, national in scope and organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended. Only after such presumption has thus been rebutted will further evidence as to whether the organization is an employer be considered. (The establishment or nonestablishment of such a right of participation will not raise any presumption as to whether an organization is, or is not, a “railway” organization. The existence of this qualification shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.) An <PRTPAGE P="213"/>organization will have established such a right of participation if:</P>
            <P>(1) It has in fact participated in the selection of labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board and has continued to participate in such selection; or</P>
            <P>(2) It has been found, under section 3 “First” (f) of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (48 Stat. 1190; 45 U.S.C. 153 “First” (f)), to be qualified to participate in the selection of labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board; or</P>
            <P>(3) It is recognized by all organizations, qualified under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, as having the right to participate in the selection of labor members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</P>
            <P>(b) The question as to whether a labor organization, national in scope, and organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, is, as such a national labor organization, a “railway” labor organization, will be determined by the Board on the basis of considerations such as the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The extent to which it is, and has been recognized as, representative of crafts or classes of employees in the railroad industry.</P>
            <P>(2) The extent to which its purposes and business are and have been to promote the interests of employees in the railroad industry.</P>
            <P>(c) A labor organization which ceased doing business before June 21, 1934, will have been an employer if its characteristics were substantially the same as those of labor organizations, doing business on or after June 21, 1934, which are established as employers in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) An organization which establishes, to the satisfaction of the Board, that it is a labor organization, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, and that is composed of labor organizations which are established as employers in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, is thereby established as being an employer.</P>
            <P>(e) For the purposes of the regulations in this chapter, a labor organization is an organization whose business is to promote the interests of employees in their capacity as employees, either directly or through their organizations.</P>

            <P>The term “employee” means (1) any individual in the service of one or more employers for compensation, (2) any individual who is in the employment relation to one or more employers, and (3) an employee representative. The term “employee” shall include an employee of a local lodge or division defined as an employer in sub-section (a) only if he was in the service of or in the employment relation to a carrier on or after the enactment date. The term “employee representative” means any officer or official representative of a railway labor organization other than a labor organization included in the term “employer” as defined in section 1(a) who before or after the enactment date was in the service of an employer as defined in section 1(a) and who is duly authorized and designated to represent employees in accordance with the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and any individual who is regularly assigned to or regularly employed by such officer or official representative in connection with the duties of his office.</P>

            <P>The term “employee” shall not include any individual while such individual is engaged in the physical operations consisting of the mining of coal, the preparation of coal, the handling (other than movement by rail with standard railroad locomotives) of coal <PRTPAGE P="214"/>not beyond the mine tipple, or the loading of coal at the tipple.</P>

            <P>An individual is in the service of an employer whether his service is rendered within or without the United States if (i) he is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service, or he is rendering professional or technical services and is integrated into the staff of the employer, or he is rendering, on the property used in the employer's operations, other personal services the rendition of which is integrated into the employer's operations, and (ii) he renders such service for compensation, or a method of computing the monthly compensation for such service is provided in section 3(c): <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That an individual shall be deemed to be in the service of an employer, other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer, not conducting the principal part of its business in the United States only when he is rendering service to it in the United States; and an individual shall be deemed to be in the service of such a local lodge or division only if (1) all, or substantially all, the individuals constituting its membership are employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States; or (2) the headquarters of such local lodge or division is located in the United States; and an individual shall be deemed to be in the service of such a general committee only if (1) he is representing a local lodge or division described in clauses (1) or (2) immediately above; or (2) all, or substantially all, the individuals represented by it are employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States; or (3) he acts in the capacity of a general chairman or an assistant general chairman of a general committee which represents individuals rendering service in the United States to an employer, but in such case if his office or headquarters is not located in the United States and the individuals represented by such general committee are employees of an employer not conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, only such proportion of the remuneration for such service shall be regarded as compensation as the proportion which the mileage in the United States under the jurisdiction of such general committee bears to the total mileage under its jurisdiction, unless such mileage formula is inapplicable in which case the Board may prescribe such other formula as it finds to be equitable, and if the application of such mileage formula, or such other formula as the Board may prescribe, would result in the compensation of the individual being less than 10 per centum of his remuneration for such service no part of such remuneration shall be regarded as compensation: <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That an individual not a citizen or resident of the United States shall not be deemed to be in the service of an employer when rendering service outside the United States to an employer who is required under the laws applicable in the place where the service is rendered to employ therein, in whole or in part, citizens or residents thereof; and the laws applicable on August 29, 1935, in the place where the service is rendered shall be deemed to have been applicable there at all times prior to that date.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In order for an individual to receive credit under the Railroad Retirement Act (Act) for railroad service prior to 1937, he or she must establish that he or she was actively working for an employer under the Act on August 29, 1935, or was in an employment relation to an emp]oyer on that date. Section 204.3 of this part defines employment relation for purposes of establishing prior service. It is also necessary to establish an employment relation to an employer for any month in which an individual wishes to receive a deemed service month, as provided for in § 210.3 of this chapter, and to receive credit for pay for time lost as provided for in § 211.3 of this chapter. This part defines employment relation for these purposes. See §§ 204.5 and 204.6. In addition, in order for an individual to have his or her service to a local lodge or division of a railway labor organization considered as creditable service under the Act, he or she must establish that he or she was working for a railroad or in an employment relation to a railroad on or after August 29, 1935, and that such employment or employment relation preceded his or her service to the local lodge or division. Section 204.7 defines employment relation for this purpose.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Employment relation—determination by the Board.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The existence or non-existence of an employment relation, as defined in this part, is a conclusion which must be reached by the Board or its authorized officers or employees upon the basis of the evidence before the agency. The employer and the employee are the principal sources of evidence with respect to a determination whether an employment relation existed, but the Board will not be bound by the mere conclusion of the employer or the employee that the employee had or did not have an employment relation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Employment relation—prior service.</SUBJECT>
            <P>An individual shall have an employment relation to an employer on August 29, 1935, for purposes of crediting service prior to January 1, 1937, if:</P>
            <P>(a) He or she was in the service of an employer on that date; or</P>
            <P>(b) He or she was on that date on 1eave of absence expressly granted by the employer or by a duly authorized representative of such employer, but only if such leave of absence was established to the satisfaction of the Board before July 1947; or</P>
            <P>(c) He or she was in the service of an employer after that date and before January 1946, in each of six calendar months, whether or not consecutive; or</P>

            <P>(d) Before that date he or she did not retire and was not retired or discharged from the service of the last <PRTPAGE P="217"/>employer by whom he or she was employed, but solely by reason of a physical or mental disability he or she ceased before August 29, 1935, to be in the service of such employer and thereafter remained continuously disabled until he or she attained age sixty-five or until August 1945; or</P>
            <P>(e) Solely for the reason stated in paragraph (c) of this section an employer by whom he or she was employed before August 29, 1935, did not on or after August 29, 1935, and before August 1945, call him or her to return to service, or if he or she were called to return to service he or she for such reason was unable to render service in six calendar months as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(f) He or she was on August 29, 1935, absent from the service of an employer by reason of a discharge which, within one year after the effective date thereof, was protested to an appropriate labor representative or to the employer, as wrongful, and which was followed within ten years of the effective date thereof by his or her reinstatement in good faith to his or her former service with all his or her seniority rights.</P>

            <P>For the purpose of crediting deemed service months as provided in § 210.3(b) of this chapter, an individual must have maintained an employment relation to one or more employers in the month or months to be deemed. For that purpose an employment relation exists with respect to any month in which an individual, although not in the active service of an employer, is on furlough subject to recall by an employer, is on a bona fide leave of absence, has not been retired or discharged but was by reason of continuous disability unable to return to service, or was not in active service because of a discharge later determined to be wrongful. However, an employment relation with respect to an employer ceases after an individual has resigned or relinquished his or her rights to return to the service of that employer or after the individual becomes entitled to receive an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>

For that purpose an employment relation exists with respect to any month in which an individual, although not in the active service of an employer, is on furlough subject to recall by an employer, is on a bona fide leave of absence, has not been retired or discharged but was by reason of continuous disability unable to return to service, or was not in active service because of a discharge later determined to be wrongful.

            <P>(a) An individual shall be an employee representative within the meaning of the Railroad Retirement Act if he or she is an officer or official representative of a railway labor organization, other than a labor organization included in the term “employer” within the meaning of part 202 of these regulations, who before or after August 29, 1935, was in the service of an “employer” within the meaning of part 202 of these regulations and who is duly authorized and designated to represent employees in accordance with the Railway Labor Act, as amended.</P>
            <P>(b) An individual is also considered to be an employee representative within the meaning of the Act if he or she is regularly assigned to or regularly employed by an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section in connection with the duties of the office of employee representative of said individual.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Example:</E> A is employed by railroad R as a carman.

Although U represents some railroad employees, it is not a railway labor organization as described in part 202 of these regulations. A is an employee representative. His service for U is treated as employee service under the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In preparing a report required under this part, an employer may report compensation in the report required for the year in which the compensation was paid even though such compensation was earned by the employee in a previous year. If compensation is reported with respect to the year in which it was paid, it shall be credited by the Board to the employee in such year unless within the four year period provided in § 211.15 of this chapter the employee requests that such compensation be credited to the year in which it was earned. If the employee makes such a request, and the Board determines that the compensation should be credited to the year in which it was earned, the reporting employer must file an adjustment report as required by § 209.9 of this part which reports such compensation in the year in which it was earned. The employee may revoke his or her request anytime prior to the filing of the adjustment report. Upon the Board's receipt of the adjustment report, the request becomes irrevocable.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Pay for time lost.</E> Compensation which is pay for time lost, as provided in § 211.3 of this chapter, shall be reported with respect to the period in which the time and compensation were lost. For example, if an employee is off work because of an on-the-job injury for a period of months in a given year and in a later year receives a payment from his or her employer to compensate for wages lost during the period of absence, the employer must, by way of adjustment provided for in § 209.9 of this part, report the compensation with respect to the year in which the time and compensation were lost.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Separation allowance or severance pay.</E> A separation allowance or severance payment shall be reported in accordance with § 209.14 of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Miscellaneous pay.</E> Miscellaneous pay, as defined in § 211.11 of this chapter, shall be reported in the year paid and reported on the annual report of compensation as provided for in § 209.8 of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Vacation pay.</E> Vacation pay may be reported in accordance with this section except that any payments made in the year following the year in which the employee resigns or is discharged shall be reported by way of adjustment under § 209.9 of this part as paid in the year of resignation or discharge.</P>

            <P>(1) An employee who is credited with less than twelve reported months of service for a calendar year after 1984 may be “deemed” to have performed service for compensation in additional months, not to exceed twelve, providing:</P>
            <P>(i) The employee's compensation for the calendar year in question exceeds an amont calculated by multiplying the number of reported months credited for that year by an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current annual maximum for non-tier I components as defined in § 211.15 of this chapter; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The employee maintains an employment relation to one or more employers or serves as an employee representative in the month or months to be deemed. For purposes of this section, employment relation has the same meaning as defined in part 204 of this chapter, disregarding the restrictions involving the establishment of such a relationship as of August 29, 1935. Employee representative has the same meaning as defined in part 205 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) Employees satisfying the conditions in both paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section shall have their months of service for a calendar year calculated using the following formula:</P>

              <P>Employee B worked in the railroad industry in 1985 and was credited with nine reported months of service (January through September) and non-tier I compensation of $20,000. The 1985 annual maximum for non-tier I compensation is $29,700. B maintained an employment relation in the three months he was not employed in 1985. The following computations are necessary to determine if B has sufficient non-tier I compensation to be credited with deemed months of service.

            <SUBJECT>Creditability of service.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Service before January 1, 1937.</E> (1) Service performed before January 1, 1937, is called prior service. Prior service is creditable under the Railroad Retirement Act if the employee had an employment relation with a railroad employer on August 29, 1935. Prior service may be combined with creditable service performed after December 31, 1936, to make the employee's total years of service equal, but not exceed, 30 years (360 months).</P>
            <P>(2) An employee is considered to have an employment relation on August 29, 1935, if:</P>
            <P>(i) The employee was on that date in active railroad service for an employer; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The employee was on that date on a leave of absence expressly granted by the employer or the employer's authorized representative, but only if such leave of absence was established to the satisfaction of the Board before July 1947; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The employee had 6 months of active railroad service for an employer during the period August 29, 1935, through December 31, 1945; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The employee was not in the service of an employer by reason of a mental or physical disability from which the employee was continuously disabled until the employee attained age 65 or until August 1945; or</P>
            <P>(v) Solely for the reason stated in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section the employee was not recalled to active service before August 1945; or</P>
            <P>(vi) If the employee was recalled, the employee was unable to perform 6 months of service during the period August 29, 1935, through December 31, 1945, solely for the reason stated in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Service after December 31, 1936.</E> All service performed after December 31, 1936, is creditable. If an employee has service both before January 1, 1937, and after December 31, 1936, all service after December 31, 1936, is credited first; if this service totals less than 30 years (360 months), then the service before January 1, 1937, is included but only up to the amount sufficient to make the total years of service equal 30. Where the years of service include only part of the service performed before January 1, 1937, the part included is taken in reverse order beginning with the last calendar month of the service.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Service after December 31, 1936, to a local lodge or division.</E> Services performed for a local lodge or division of a railway labor organization is creditable if the employee is credited with compensation as defined in § 211.2 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Service based on time lost.</E> Any month or any part of a month during which an employee performed no active service but received pay for time lost as an employee is counted as a month of service. Service for time lost as an employee shall be credited as provided for in § 211.3 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Place of performance of service.</E> (1) Service performed for an employer who <PRTPAGE P="227"/>conducts the principal part of its business with the United States is creditable. However, service performed for an employer who conducts the principal part of its business outside the United States is creditable only when the service is performed in the United States. If an employer, other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway labor organization, does not conduct the principal part of its business within the United States, the service performed outside the United States for that employer is not creditable.</P>
            <P>(2) Service performed outside the United States by an employee who is not a citizen or resident of the United States is not creditable if the employer is required under the laws of that place to hire, in whole or in part, only citizens or residents of that place.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Service as employee representative.</E> Service performed as an employee representative is creditable in the same manner and to the same extent as service performed for an employer.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Service performed after the beginning date of an annuity.</E> Service performed after the beginning date of an annuity shall be used in the annuity recomputation.</P>

            <P>Service claimed by an employee, which is not credited in the records of the Board, must be verified to the satisfaction of the Board before it may be credited. Verification of the Service claimed shall be as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) Service claimed will be verified from the payroll or other detailed records of the employer.</P>
            <P>(b) If the payroll or other detailed records are incomplete or missing, the service claimed and not established by these records will be verified from the personnel records of the employer.</P>
            <P>(c) If the payroll, personnel and detailed records are incomplete or missing, the service claimed and not established by these records will be verified from any other books and records of the employer.</P>
            <P>(d) If the employer's records do not establish the service claimed, the employee may submit affidavits and other evidence in support of the service claimed in either of the following instances:</P>
            <P>(1) When there are no employer records available to show whether or not the service claimed was performed; or</P>
            <P>(2) When there are employer records available which do not verify the service claimed and do not establish that the service claimed was not performed.</P>
            <P>(e) When service is verified as to over-all dates, but is not supported in detail by employer records, and when there are no employer records showing in detail absences from service, a deduction shall be made to cover an average amount of the absences. The deduction shall be the absences shown by the applicant or 5 percent of the total period in question, whichever is greater. However, where the employee submits detailed records of the service claimed, properly identified and established as having been made at the time the employee performed the service for which detailed records of the employer are not available, full credit may be allowed for the service as may be verified from the records. Also, the employee may be permitted to establish in any other manner satisfactory to the Board the actual amount of his or her absences.</P>
            <P>(f) For the purpose of verifying service before 1937, employers shall preserve through 1986, in accessible form, the original records of the service and compensation.</P>

            <P>(g) For the purpose of verifying service after 1936, employers shall preserve in accessible form the original records <PRTPAGE P="228"/>of service and compensation for a period of five calendar years after the due date of the report.</P>

            <P>(11) Payments paid to an employee or employee representative which are subject to tax under section 3201(a) or 3211(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 are creditable as compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act for purposes of computation of benefits under sections 3(a)(1), 3(f)(3), 4(a)(1) and 4(f)(1).</P>
            <P>(12) Voluntary payments of any tax by an employer, without deducting such tax from the employee's salary.</P>

            <P>(a) A payment made to an employee for a period during which the employee was absent from the active service of the employer is considered to be pay for time lost and is, therefore, creditable compensation. Pay for time lost as an employee includes:</P>
            <P>(1) Pay received for a certain period of time due to personal injury, or</P>
            <P>(2) Pay received for loss of earnings for a certain period of time, resulting from the employee being placed in a position or occupation paying less money. In reporting compensation which represents pay for time lost, employers shall allocate the amount paid to the employee to the month(s) in which the time was actually lost. The entire amount of any payment made to an employee for personal injury is considered pay for time lost unless, at the time of payment, the employer states that a particular amount of the payment was for reasons other than pay for time lost.</P>
            <P>(b) Where pay for time lost is allocated to the month(s) in which the time was actually lost, the Board will accept the allocation made by the parties involved if it relates to the employee's normal monthly pay. A reasonable relationship to an employee's normal monthly pay is ordinarily no less than ten times the employee's daily pay rate.</P>

            <P>Military service is the performance of active service by an individual in the armed forces of the United States. An individual is considered to be in active military service when commissioned or enrolled in the land, naval or air forces of the United States until resignation or discharge therefrom. The service of an individual in any reserve component of the land, naval or air forces of the United States, during any period in which ordered to active duty, even though less than thirty days, is also considered active service. However, service in the Army Specialist Corps and the Merchant Marine is not creditable under the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>

            <P>(e) September 8, 1939, through June 14, 1948—National Emergency and World War II. Individuals required to continue in service after this period may be credited with the service if:</P>
            <P>(1) They were in military service on December 31, 1946, or</P>
            <P>(2) They were required to remain in military service involuntarily after December 31, 1946;</P>

            <P>(1) Entered into involuntarily; or</P>
            <P>(2) Entered into voluntarily, but only if:</P>
            <P>(i) The individual who seeks credit for this service performs service as an employee for an employer as defined in part 202 of this chapter either in the year of his or her release from active military service or in the year following such release, and;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Board's determination for use of military service.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Military service may be creditable under both the Railroad Retirement and Social Security Acts, but there are provisions under those Acts to prevent duplicate use of the service. The Railroad Retirement Board will determine whether an employee's military service should be used as railroad service or as Social Security service. The Board's determination is intended to be to the employee's advantage; however, if the employee does not agree with the Board's determination for use of the employee's military service, the employee may request that it be changed.</P>
            <P>(b) Generally, it is to the employee's advantage for the employee's military service to be creditable as railroad service where any of the following conditions may be met with the use of the employee's military service as railroad service:</P>
            <P>(1) It gives the employee 10 years of service (120 months), which is the minimum needed to qualify for an annuity based on age and service or total disability, as provided for in part 216, subpart B; or</P>
            <P>(2) It gives the employee 20 years of service (240 months), which is the minimum needed to qualify for an occupational disability annuity, as provided for in § 216.6 of this chapter; or</P>
            <P>(3) It gives the employee 25 years of service (300 months), which is the minimum needed to qualify for a supplemental annuity, as provided for in part 216, subpart C; or</P>
            <P>(4) It gives the employee 30 years of service (360 months), which would allow the employee to retire at age 60 with a full annuity and will also provide a full annuity to a qualified spouse at age 60, as provided for in part 216, subparts B and D; or</P>
            <P>(5) It gives the employee sufficient railroad service to entitle the employee to vested dual benefit payments, as provided for in part 216, subpart H.</P>
            <P>(c) In certain cases it may be to the employee's advantage for the employee's military service to be credited under the Social Security Act. This is generally true under the following conditions:</P>

            <P>(1) Crediting the military service under the Social Security Act would entitle the employee and any eligible children to social security benefits, since direct benefits are not payable to <PRTPAGE P="234"/>children of retired employees under the Railroad Retirement Act; or</P>
            <P>(2) Crediting the military service under the Social Security Act would entitle employee to vested dual benefit payments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A current connection with the railroad industry is required to qualify for certain types of railroad retirement benefits. The existence of a current connection is clear in most cases where entitlement or death immediately follows continuous years of railroad employment. However, there are cases in which the employee did not work for a railroad employer for a period of time before entitlement or death. In these situations, special tests are applied to determine whether the employee can be considered to have a current connection with the railroad industry for the purpose of determining his or her eligibility for an annuity or other benefits.</P>

              <P>The amount of regular non-railroad employment needed to break a current connection depends on when the applicable 30-month period ends (see § 216.13 of this part), as follows:</P>

              <P>To be eligible for an employee, a spouse, or a divorced spouse annuity, the Railroad Retirement Act requires that an applicant must stop work for pay performed as an employee for a railroad employer. In addition, no employee, spouse or divorced spouse annuity may be paid for any month in which the employee, spouse or divorced spouse annuitant works for pay for any railroad employer after the date his or her annuity began. No annuity may be paid to a widow or widower, surviving divorced spouse, remarried widow or widower, child, or parent for any month such individual works for pay for a railroad employer.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Work for a railroad employer.</E> Work for pay as an employee of a railroad employer always prevents payment of an annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Work for last non-railroad employer.</E> Work for pay in the service of the last non-railroad employer by whom an individual is employed will reduce the amount of the tier II benefit of the employee, spouse and supplemental annuity as provided in part 230 of this chapter. An individual's last non-railroad employer is:</P>
              <P>(1) Any non-railroad employer from whom the individual last resigned (in point of time) in order to receive an annuity; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Work which does not affect eligibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>An individual may engage in any of the following without adversely affecting his or her annuity:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Work for a railway labor organization.</E> An individual may work for a local lodge or division of a railway labor organization if the pay is under $25 a month, unless the work performed is solely for the purpose of collecting insurance premiums.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Work without pay.</E> Work performed for any person or entity for which no pay is received, or where the pay merely constitutes reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, or where the amount received consists only of free will donations and there is no agreement that such donation shall constitute remuneration for services, does not affect entitlement to an annuity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Self-employment.</E> Self-employment is work performed in an individual's own business, trade or profession as an independent contractor, rather than as an employee. An individual is not self-employed if the business is incorporated. The designation or description <PRTPAGE P="239"/>of the relationship between the individual and another person as anything other than that of an employer and employee is immaterial. If the Board determines that an employer-employee relationship exists, the fact that the employee is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or the like will be disregarded. An individual determined to be an employee of a railroad employer pursuant to part 203 of this chapter is not self-employed. Whether an individual performing services is an employee depends upon the degree to which the recipient of services controls the individual's work. Control is determined in accordance with general legal principles delineating an employer-employee relationship. Among the factors considered are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Instructions.</E> An individual required to comply with instructions about when, where, and how to work is ordinarily an employee. Instructions may be oral or in the form of manuals or written procedures which show how the desired result is to be accomplished. An individual who ordinarily works without receiving instructions because he or she is highly skilled or knowledgeable may nevertheless be an employee if the employer has a right to instruct the individual in performance of the work.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Training.</E> Training provided an individual by an employer indicates that the employer wants the work to be performed in a particular method or manner, especially if the training is given periodically or at frequent intervals. An individual may be trained by an experienced employee working with him or her, by correspondence, by required attendance at meetings, or by other methods.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Integration into the employer's business.</E> Integration of an individual's services into the business operations of an employer generally shows that the individual is subject to direction and control. When the success or continuation of a business depends to an appreciable degree upon the performance of certain services, the individuals who perform those services must necessarily be subject to a certain amount of control by the owner of the business.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Services rendered personally.</E> A requirement that an individual personally work for the employer indicates that the employer is interested in the methods as well as the results, and that the employer intends to control the result by controlling who does the work.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Hiring, supervising, and payment of assistants.</E> An employer generally hires, supervises, and pays assistants. An individual who hires, supervises, and pays other workers at the direction of the employer may be an employee acting as a representative of the employer. However, if an individual hires, supervises, and pays his or her own assistants pursuant to a contract under which the individual agrees to provide materials and labor and under which the individual is responsible only for the attainment of a result, this factor indicates an independent contractor status.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Continuing work relationship.</E> A work relationship between an individual and an employer which continues over time indicates that the individual is an employee. A relationship may continue if the individual works at frequently recurring, though somewhat irregular intervals, either on call of the employer or when work is available.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Set hours of work.</E> A requirement that an individual work for an employer during a specified period of the day, week, month or year, or for a specified number of hours daily indicates that the individual is an employee. An individual whose occupation renders fixed hours impractical may be an employee if required by the employer to work at certain times.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Full time required.</E> A requirement that an individual devote full time to the employer's business indicates that the individual is an employee. What full time means may vary with the intent of the parties, the nature of the occupation, and customs in the locality. Full-time work may be required indirectly even though not specified in writing or orally. An individual required to produce a minimum volume of business for an employer may be compelled to devote full time to producing the work. Prohibiting work for <PRTPAGE P="240"/>any other employer may require an individual to work full time to earn a living However, part-time work performed on a regular basis, or on call of the employer, or when work is available, may also render an individual an employee.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Working on employer's premises.</E> Working on the employer's premises may indicate that an individual is an employee where by nature the work could be done elsewhere, because the employer's place of business is physically within the employer's direction and supervision. Desk space, telephone, and stenographic services provided by an employer place the worker within the employer's direction and supervision unless the worker has the option not to use these facilities. Work done off the employer's premises does not by itself indicate that the worker is not an employee because some occupations require that work be performed away from the premises of the employer. Control over the place of work is indicated when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to compel the worker to travel a designated route, to canvass a territory within a certain time, or to work at specific places as required.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Order or sequence set.</E> Performing tasks in the order or sequence set by the employer indicates that the worker is an employee. Often, because of the nature of an occupation, the person or persons for whom the services are performed do not set the order of the services or set the order infrequently. It is sufficient to show control, however, if such person or persons retain the right to do so.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Oral or written reports.</E> Regular oral or written reports submitted to the employer indicate that the worker is an employee, compelled to account to the employer for his or her actions.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Payment by hour, week, month.</E> Payment at a fixed rate per hour, week, or month indicates that an individual is an employee. Payment by commission with a guaranteed minimum salary, or by a drawing account at stated intervals with no requirement to repay amounts which exceed the individual's earnings, also indicates that an individual is an employee. Payment in a lump sum for a completed job indicates that an individual is self-employed. The lump sum may be computed by the number of hours required to do the job at a fixed hourly rate, or by weekly or monthly installments toward a lump sum agreed upon in advance as the total cost. Payment made on a straight commission basis generally indicates that the worker is an independent contractor.</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">Payment of business and/or traveling expenses.</E> Payment by the employer of expenses which an individual incurs in connection with the employer's business indicates that the individual is an employee.</P>
              <P>(14) <E T="03">Furnishing of tools and materials.</E> The fact that the person or persons for whom the services are performed furnish significant tools, materials, and other equipment tends to show the existence of an employer-employee relationship.</P>
              <P>(15) <E T="03">Investment in facilities.</E> If the worker invests in facilities which are used by the worker in performing services and which are not typically maintained by employees, such as an office rented by the worker from a party unrelated to the worker or to the employer, this factor tends to indicate that the worker is an independent contractor. On the other hand, if all facilities necessary to the work which an individual performs are furnished without charge by the employer, this factor indicates the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Facilities include equipment or premises necessary for the work, other than items such as tools, instruments, and clothing which may be commonly provided by an employee in a particular trade.</P>
              <P>(16) <E T="03">Realization of profit or loss.</E> An individual not in a position to realize a profit or suffer a loss as a result of work performed for an employer is an employee. An individual has an opportunity for profit or loss if he or she:</P>
              <P>(i) Hires, directs, and pays assistants;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has his or her own office, equipment, materials, or other facilities for doing the work;</P>
              <P>(iii) Has continuing and recurring liabilities or obligations, and success or failure depends on the relation of receipts to expenditures; or</P>

              <P>(iv) Agrees to perform specific jobs for prices agreed upon in advance and <PRTPAGE P="241"/>pays expenses incurred in connection with the work.</P>
              <P>(17) <E T="03">Working for more than one firm at a time.</E> If a worker performs more than <E T="03">de minimis</E> services for a number of unrelated persons or firms at the same time, this factor generally indicates that the worker is an independent contractor. However, a worker who performs services for more than one person may be an employee of each of the persons, especially where such persons are part of the same service arrangement.</P>
              <P>(18) <E T="03">Making service available to the general public.</E> The fact that an individual makes his or her services available to the general public on a regular and consistent basis rather than to one employer indicates that the individual is self-employed rather than an employee of any one firm. An individual may make services available to the public by working from his or her own office with assistants, from his or her own home, by holding business licenses, by a listing in a business directory, or by advertising.</P>
              <P>(19) <E T="03">Employer's right to discharge.</E> The right to discharge a worker is a factor which indicates that the worker is an employee and the person who possesses the right is an employer. An employer exercises control through the threat of dismissal, which causes the worker to obey the employer's instructions. An employer's right to discharge exists even if it is restricted due to a collective bargaining agreement. An employer ordinarily cannot end a relationship without incurring liability with a self-employed individual who meets contract specifications.</P>
              <P>(20) <E T="03">Employee's right to terminate.</E> The fact that an individual has the right to end his or her relationship with an employer at any time without incurring liability for work to be performed indicates that the individual is an employee. A self-employed individual is legally obligated to satisfactorily complete a specific job.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">When right to return to work is ended.</E> An individual's right to return to work for a railroad employer is ended whenever any of the following events occur:</P>
              <P>(1) The employer reports to the Board that the individual no longer has the right;</P>
              <P>(2) The individual or an authorized agent of that individual gives the employer an oral or written notice of the individual's wish to give up that right and:</P>
              <P>(i) The individual certifies to the Board that the right has been given up;</P>
              <P>(ii) The Board notifies the employer of the individual's certification; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The employer either confirms the individual's right has been given up or fails to reply within 10 days following the day the Board mailed the notice to the employer;</P>
              <P>(3) An event occurs which under the established rules or practices of the employer automatically ends that right;</P>
              <P>(4) The employer or the individual or both take an action which clearly and positively ends that right;</P>
              <P>(5) The individual never had that right and permanently stops working;</P>
              <P>(6) The Board gives up that right for the individual, having been authorized to do so by the individual;</P>
              <P>(7) The individual dies; or</P>
              <P>(8) The individual signs a statement that he or she gives up all rights to return to work in order to receive a separation allowance or severance pay.</P>

              <P>The Railroad Retirement Act provides two types of disability annuities for employees who have been credited with at least 10 years of railroad service.

              <P>An employee with a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of retirement may qualify for a supplemental annuity in addition to the regular employee annuity. Supplemental annuities are paid from a separate account funded by employer taxes in addition to those assessed for regular annuities.

              <P>An employee is entitled to a supplemental annuity if he or she:</P>
              <P>(a) Has been credited with railroad service in at least one month before October 1981;</P>

              <SUBJECT>How a private railroad pension affects a supplemental annuity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">What is a private railroad pension.</E> The Board determines whether a pension established by a railroad employer is a private pension that will cause a reduction in the employee's supplemental annuity. A private pension for purposes of this subpart is a plan that:</P>
              <P>(1) Is a written plan or arrangement which is communicated to the employees to whom it applies;</P>
              <P>(2) Is established and maintained by an employer for a defined group of employees; and</P>
              <P>(3) Provides for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement or disability. Such a plan is sometimes referred to as a defined benefit plan.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Defined contribution plan.</E> A plan under which the employer is obligated to make fixed contributions to the plan regardless of profits (sometimes known as a money purchase plan) is a private pension plan. A plan under which the employer's contributions are discretionary is not a private pension plan under this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other than retirement benefits.</E> A plan which provides benefits not customarily considered retirement benefits (such as unemployment benefits, sickness or hospitalization benefits) is not a private pension plan under this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective date of private railroad pension for supplemental annuity purposes.</E> A private pension reduces a supplemental annuity payment effective on the first day of the month after the month the Board determines that it is a private pension as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of private railroad pension.</E> A supplemental annuity is reduced by the amount of any private pension the employee is receiving which is attributable to an employer's contributions, less any amount by which the private pension is reduced because of the supplemental annuity. The supplemental annuity is not reduced for the amount of a private pension attributable to the employee's contributions. The Board will determine the amount of a private pension for any month which is attributable to the employee's contributions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Effect of a supplemental annuity on other benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Employee annuity.</E> A supplemental annuity that begins after December 31, 1974, does not affect the payment of a regular employee annuity. A supplemental annuity beginning prior to 1975 causes a reduction in the employee annuity as provided by section 3(j) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937.<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Spouse or survivor annuity.</E> The payment of a supplemental annuity does not affect the amount of a spouse or survivor annuity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Residual lump-sum.</E> The amount of a supplemental annuity is not deducted from the gross residual lump-sum benefit. See part 234 of this chapter for an explanation of the residual lump-sum benefit.</P>

              <P>(3) Age 60 but less than retirement age. In such case, the tier I component is reduced if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The employee was under age 62 at the time his or her annuity began;</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee annuity began after June 30, 1984;</P>

              <P>The Railroad Retirement Act provides an annuity for the child of a deceased employee but not for the child of a living employee. The Act does provide that the child of a living employee can establish another individual's eligibility for a spouse annuity or cause an increase in the annuities of an employee and spouse. The eligibility requirements described in this subpart also apply for the following purposes, except as otherwise indicated in this part:</P>
              <P>(a) To establish annuity eligibility for a spouse under subpart F of this part if he or she has the employee's eligible child in care;</P>
              <P>(b) To establish annuity eligibility for a widow(er), or surviving divorce spouse or remarried widow(er) under subpart G of this part if he or she has the employee's child in care; or</P>

              <P>(c) To provide an increase in the employee's annuity under the Social Security Overall Minimum Guaranty (see <PRTPAGE P="248"/>part 229) by including the eligible child.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When a child is a full-time elementary or secondary school student.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A child is a full-time elementary or secondary school student if he or she meets all of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The child is in full-time attendance at an elementary or secondary school; or</P>
              <P>(2) The child is instructed in elementary or secondary education at home in accordance with a home school law of the State or other jurisdiction in which the child resides; or</P>
              <P>(3) The child is in an independent study elementary or a secondary education program administered by the local school, district, or jurisdiction, which is in accordance with the law of the State or other jurisdiction in which he or she resides.</P>
              <P>(b) The child is in full-time attendance in a day or evening non-correspondence course of at least 13 weeks duration and he or she is carrying a subject load that is considered full-time for day students under the institution's standards and practices. If he or she is in a home schooling program as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, he or she must be carrying a subject load that is considered full-time for day students under the standards and practices set by the State or other jurisdiction in which the student resides.</P>

              <P>(c) To be considered in full-time attendance, scheduled attendance must be at the rate of at least 20 hours per week unless one of the exceptions in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section applies. If the student is in an independent study program as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the number of hours spent in school attendance is determined by combining <PRTPAGE P="249"/>the number of hours of attendance at a school facility with the agreed upon number of hours spent in independent study. The student may still be considered in full-time attendance if the scheduled rate of attendance is below 20 hours per week if the Board finds that:</P>
              <P>(1) The school attended does not schedule at least 20 hours per week and going to that particular school is the student's only reasonable alternative; or</P>
              <P>(2) The student's medical condition prevents him or her from having scheduled attendance of at least 20 hours per week. To prove that the student's medical condition prevents him or her from scheduling 20 hours per week, the Board may request that the student provide appropriate medical evidence or a statement from the school; or</P>
              <P>(3) The student is not attending classes, but is graduating in that month and classes ended the month before.</P>
              <P>(d) An individual is not a full-time student if, while attending an elementary or secondary school, he or she is paid compensation by an employer who has requested or required that the individual attend the school. An individual is not a full time student while he or she is confined in a penal institution or correctional facility because he or she committed a felony after October 19, 1980.</P>
              <P>(e) A student who reaches age 19 but has not completed the requirements for a secondary school diploma or certificate and who is a full-time elementary or secondary student, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, will continue to be eligible for benefits until the first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or semester in which he or she is then enrolled, or if the school is not operated on a quarter or semester system, the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(1) The first day of the month following completion of the course(s) in which he or she was enrolled when age 19 was reached; or</P>
              <P>(2) The first day of the third month following the month in which he or she reached age 19.</P>

              <P>An individual may meet the eligibility provisions for more than one annuity described in this part. The Railroad Retirement Act generally requires that the total amount of annuities otherwise independently payable to one individual must be reduced if that individual is entitled to multiple annuities.

However, this reduction does not apply (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) if the spouse, divorced spouse or survivor or the individual upon whose earnings record the spouse, divorced spouse or survivor annuity is based worked for a railroad employer or as an employee representative before January 1, 1975.</P>

Where the spouse or survivor is entitled to a tier II component, then a portion of this reduction may be restored in the computation of this component.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An application filed with the Board is generally one that is filed on a form set up by the Board for that purpose. See part 200 of this chapter for a list of application forms.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Claim filed with the Social Security Administration.</E> An application filed for benefits under title II of the Social Security Act on one of the forms set up by the Social Security Administration for that purpose (except an application for a disability insurance benefit that terminated before the employee completed his or her 120th month of creditable railroad service) is also considered an application for an annuity or lump sum if it is filed as shown in § 217.7.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Claim filed with the Veterans Administration.</E> An application filed with the Veterans Administration on one of its forms for survivor benefits under section 3005 of title 38, United States Code, is also considered an application for a survivor annuity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Claim filed with the Social Security Administration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Claim is for life benefits.</E> An application for life benefits under title II of the Social Security Act is an application for an annuity if the conditions either in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) or in paragraph (a)(4) of this section are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The application was filed because the applicant did not know he or she was eligible for an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. The Board must have or receive evidence indicating why the applicant thought that he or she lacked eligibility for an annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) The claimant would have been entitled to and would currently be entitled to an annuity under subpart B or D of part 216 of this chapter if the applicant had applied for the annuity on the date the social security application was filed.</P>
              <P>(3) The applicant asks the Board in a written statement to consider the application for social security benefits as an application for an employee or spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(4) The application was filed because the employee had less than 10 years of creditable railroad service, and having established entitlement to social security benefits and continued working in railroad service, subsequently acquired 10 years of railroad service.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Claim is for death benefits.</E> An application for death benefits under title II of the Social Security Act is an application for an annuity or lump sum if—</P>
              <P>(1) The application is filed based on the death of an employee and the Board has jurisdiction for the payment of survivor benefits based on the compensation record of the deceased employee; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>When one application satisfies the filing requirement for other benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>An annuity application filed with the Board is generally considered as an application for other benefits to which a person is or may be eligible. Therefore a claimant does not need to file another application to be entitled to any of the following types of benefits:</P>
              <P>(a) An employee age annuity if—</P>
              <P>(1) The employee's application for a disability annuity is denied and the employee is eligible for the age annuity on the date the application is filed; or</P>
              <P>(2) The employee is entitled to a disability annuity in the month before the month he or she is 65 years old.</P>
              <P>(b) An employee disability annuity if an application for an age annuity is denied and the employee is eligible for the disability annuity on the date the application is filed.</P>

              <P>(e) A widow(er)'s annuity if the widow(er) was included in the computation of the employee's annuity under the social security overall minimum provision of the Railroad Retirement Act in the month before the month the employee died.</P>
              <P>(f) A child's annuity if the spouse of the employee had the child “in care” and was entitled to a spouse annuity in the month before the month the employee died.</P>
              <P>(g) A child's annuity or child's full-time student annuity if the child of the employee was included in the computation of the employee's annuity under the social security overall minimum provision of the Railroad Retirement Act in the month before the month the employee died.</P>
              <P>(h) A widow(er)'s annuity based on age if the widow(er) was entitled to a widow(er)'s annuity based on disability in the month before the month in which he or she attains age 60.</P>
              <P>(i) A widow(er)'s annuity based on age or disability if a widow(er), who was receiving an annuity because he or she had the employee's child “in care”, is eligible for an age or disability annuity when he or she no longer has an eligible child “in care”.</P>

              <P>(k) A widow(er)'s annuity based upon having the employee's child “in care” if during the time the widow(er) is entitled to an annuity based on disability, he or she has “in care” a child of the deceased employee.</P>

              <P>(m) A divorced spouse annuity if the spouse claimant has remarried the employee during the six-month retroactive period of the spouse annuity application.</P>
              <P>(n) A divorced spouse annuity if the divorced spouse was entitled to a spouse annuity not reduced for age in the month before the month of the effective date of the final decree of divorce and would also be entitled to a divorced spouse annuity not reduced for age.</P>
              <P>(o) A surviving divorced spouse annuity if the surviving divorced spouse was entitled to a divorced spouse annuity in the month before the month the employee died.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When effective period ends.</E> The effective period of an application ends on the date of the notice of an initial decision denying the claim. If a timely appeal is made (see part 260 of this chapter) the effective period of the application ends on the date of the notice of the decision of the referee, on the date of the notice of the final decision of the Board, or when court review of the denial has been completed. After the effective period of an application ends, the person must file a new application for any annuity or lump sum to which the claimant believes he or she is eligible.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application filed before claimant is eligible</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as shown in paragraph (b)(2) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an application for an annuity must be denied if it is filed with the Board more than three months before the date an annuity can begin.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for disability annuity.</E> If the Board determines that a claimant for a disability annuity is disabled under part 220 of this chapter, beginning with a date after the application is filed and before a final decision is made, the application is treated as though it were filed on the date the claimant became disabled. The claimant may be an employee, widow(er), surviving divorced spouse, remarried widow(er), or surviving child.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Application for spouse annuity filed simultaneously with employee disability annuity application.</E> When the qualifying employee's annuity application effective period is determined by the preceding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a spouse who meets all eligibility requirements may file an annuity application on the same date as the employee claimant. The spouse application will be treated as though it were filed on the later of the actual filing date or the employee's annuity beginning date.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application filed after the claimant is eligible</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application for lump-sum death payment.</E> An application for a lump-sum death payment under part 234 of this chapter must be filed within two years after the death of the employee. This period may be extended under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, or when the applicant can prove “good cause” under § 217.11 of this chapter for not filing within the time limit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for annuity unpaid at death.</E> An application for an annuity due but unpaid at death under part 234 of this chapter must be filed within two years after the death of the person entitled to the annuity. This period may be extended under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, or when the applicant can prove “good cause” under § 217.11 of this chapter for not filing within the time limit.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Application for residual lump sum.</E> An application for a residual lump sum under part 234 of this chapter may be filed at any time after the death of the employee.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Application for a period of disability.</E> In order to be entitled to a period of disability under part 220 of this chapter, an employee must apply while he or she is disabled under part 220 or not later than 12 months after the month in which the period of disability ends except that an employee who is unable to apply within the 12-month period after the period of disability ends because his or her physical condition limited his or her activities to the extent that he or she could not complete and sign an application or because he or she was mentally incompetent, may apply no later than 36 months after the period of disability ends.</P>

              <P>(b) A claimant who is unable to write must make his or her mark. A Board representative or two other persons must sign as witnesses to a signature by mark.</P>

              <P>(c) A claimant's representative, as described in part 266 of this chapter, <PRTPAGE P="256"/>must sign the application if the claimant is incompetent (unable to handle his or her own affairs).</P>

              <P>(e) If it is necessary to protect a claimant from losing benefits and there is good cause for the claimant not personally signing the application, the Board may accept an application signed by someone other than a person described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. A person who signs an application for someone else will be required to provide evidence of his or her authority to sign the application for the person claiming benefits under the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) If the person who signs is a court-appointed representative, he or she must submit a certificate issued by the court showing authority to act for the claimant.</P>

              <P>(4) The Board may, at any time, in its sole discretion require additional evidence to establish the authority of a person to sign an application for someone else.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Before benefits awarded.</E> If the Board selects a representative for an incompetent claimant (see part 266 of this chapter) after an application is filed but before the benefit is awarded, a new benefit application must be filed by the representative. However, benefits will be paid using the filing date of the original benefit application.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">After benefits awarded.</E> If the Board selects a representative after a monthly annuity was awarded to another person, the representative must apply as a substitute payee on a form specifically designed for that purpose. A new annuity application is not required.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Statement filed with the Board.</E> A written statement indicating an intent to file a claim for an annuity or lump sum, filed with the Board as provided in §§ 217.15 and 217.16, can establish the filing date of an application. A form set up by the Board to obtain information about persons who may be eligible for an annuity or lump sum in a particular case is not by itself considered a written statement for the purpose of this section. The Board will use the filing date of the written statement if all of the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The statement gives a person's clear and positive intent to claim an annuity or lump sum for himself or herself or for some other person.</P>
              <P>(2) The claimant or a person described in § 217.17 signs the statement.</P>
              <P>(3) The person who signed the statement files an application with the Board on one of the forms described in part 200 of this chapter within 90 days after the date a notice is sent advising the person of the need to file an application.</P>
              <P>(4) The claimant is alive when the application is filed except as provided in § 217.10.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Statement filed with the Social Security Administration.</E> A written statement filed with the Social Security Administration can be used to establish the filing date of an application if, assuming the statement were an application, the conditions under § 217.7 are met and—</P>
              <P>(1) The statement gives a clear and positive intent to claim benefits under title II of the Social Security Act;</P>
              <P>(2) The claimant or a person described in § 217.17 signs the statement;</P>
              <P>(3) The statement is sent to the Board by the Social Security Administration;</P>
              <P>(4) The person who signed the statement files an application with the Board on one of the forms described in part 200 of this chapter within 90 days after the date a notice is sent advising the person of the need to file an application; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Telephone contact with the Board.</E> If an individual telephones a Board office and advises a Board employee that he or she intends to file an application but cannot do so before the end of the month, the Board employee will prepare and sign a written statement which may be used to establish the filing date of an application if all of the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The inquirer expresses a clear and positive intent to claim benefits for himself or herself or for some other person;</P>
              <P>(2) The prescribed application cannot be filed by the end of the current month;</P>
              <P>(3) The inquirer is either the potential claimant or the person who will file an application as representative payee therefor;</P>
              <P>(4) The inquiry is received by an office of the Board no more than 3 months before eligibility exists;</P>
              <P>(5) It appears that a loss of benefits might otherwise result;</P>
              <P>(6) The telephone inquirer files an application with the Board on one of the forms described in part 200 of this chapter within 90 days after the date a notice is sent advising the person of the need to file an application; and</P>
              <P>(7) The claimant is alive when the application is filed, except as provided in § 217.10 of the part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The rules in this subpart apply only to an employee, spouse, divorced spouse, and supplemental annuity. They do not apply to any type of survivor annuity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Work started after annuity beginning date.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An annuity can begin only after an employee, spouse, or divorced spouse stops any work for a railroad employer. However, if the employee, spouse or divorced spouse starts work after an “intent to retire” is established, that work will have no effect on the annuity beginning date. However, an annuity cannot be paid for any month the employee, spouse or divorced spouse returns to work for a railroad employer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Intent to retire</E>—(1) <E T="03">Disability annuity.</E> An “intent to retire” is established to pay a disability annuity when—</P>
              <P>(i) The employee files for a disability annuity; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee gives up all rights to return to work for a railroad employee before starting any new work.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Age annuity.</E> An “intent to retire” is established to pay an employee age, spouse or divorced spouse annuity when the employee, spouse or divorced spouse gives up all rights to return to work for a railroad employer before starting any new work.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Vacation pay.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">From railroad employer.</E> Vacation pay may be credited to the vacation period due the employee or to the last day of actual work for the railroad employer. If the vacation pay is credited to the vacation period, the annuity can begin no earlier than the day after the vacation period ends. (Part 211 of this chapter discusses how vacation pay is credited as compensation.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">From non-railroad employer.</E> Vacation pay will not affect the annuity beginning date.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sick pay.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">From railroad employer.</E> If the employee is carried on the payroll while sick, the annuity can begin no earlier than the day after the last day of sick pay. However, sick pay is not considered compensation and does not affect the annuity beginning date if it is a payment described in § 211.2(c)(6) of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">From non-railroad employer.</E> Sick pay will not affect the annuity beginning date.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Pay for time lost.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Pay for time lost because of personal injury must be credited to an actual period of time lost. The annuity can begin no earlier than the day after that period ends.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 218.30</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Separation, displacement or dismissal allowance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When an employee receives a separation, displacement or dismissal allowance from a railroad employer, the annuity beginning date depends on whether the payments are a separation allowance as described in paragraph (b) of this section, or monthly compensation payments as described in paragraph (c) of this section. (Part 211 of this chapter discusses how a separation, displacement or dismissal alowance is credited as compensation.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Separation allowance.</E> When an employee accepts a separation allowance, the employee gives up his or her job rights. Regardless of whether a separation allowance is paid in a lump sum or in installments, the annuity can begin as early as the day after the day the separation allowance is credited.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Monthly compensation payments.</E> An employee who receives monthly compensation payments keeps his or her job rights while the payments are being made. The annuity cannot begin until after the end of the period for which payments are made.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of ended disability annuity on eligibility for a later annuity.</E> The ending of a disability annuity will not affect an employee's rights to receive any annuity to which he or she later becomes entitled. When a disability annuity ends before an employee attains full retirement age, any additional railroad service the employee has after the disability annuity ends can be credited as if no annuity had previously been paid.</P>

              <P>As described in parts 216 (Eligibility for an Annuity), 234 (Lump-Sum Payments), and 222 (Family Relationships), certain requirements must be met before benefits may be paid under the Railroad Retirement Act. This part contains the basic rules for evidence that is required to support a claimant's claim for monthly or lump-sum benefit payments under the Railroad Retirement Act. Part 219 describes when evidence is required and what types of documents can be used as evidence. Part 222 defines and explains family relationships for which evidence requirements are stated in part 219. Special evidence requirements for disability annuities are found in part 220 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Convincing evidence</E> means one or more pieces of evidence that proves to the satisfaction of the Board that an individual meets a requirement for eligibility for benefits. See § 219.7 for guides the Board uses in deciding whether evidence is convincing.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Eligible</E> means that a person meets all of the requirements for payment of benefits but has not yet applied therefor.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">To prove initial eligibility.</E> The Board will ask for evidence to prove a claimant is eligible for benefits when he or she applies for benefits. Usually the Board will ask the claimant to furnish specific kinds of evidence or information by a certain date to prove initial eligibility for benefits. If evidence or information is not received by that date, the Board may decide that the claimant is not eligible for benefits and will deny his or her application.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">To prove continued entitlement.</E> After a claimant establishes entitlement to an annuity, the Board may ask that annuitant to produce by a certain date information or evidence needed to decide whether he or she may continue to receive an annuity or whether the annuity should be reduced or stopped. If the information is not received by the date specified, the Board may decide that the person is no longer entitled to benefits or that his or her annuity should be stopped or reduced.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">What to do when required evidence will be delayed.</E> When the required evidence cannot be furnished within the specified time, the claimant or representative who was asked to furnish the evidence or information should notify the Board and explain why there will be a delay. If the delay is caused by illness, failure to receive the information from another source, or a similar situation, the claimant will be allowed a reasonable time to secure the evidence or information. If the information is not received within a reasonable time as determined by the Board, the claimant or representative who was asked to furnish the evidence or information will be notified of the effect that his or her failure to furnish the evidence or information will have on the claimant's eligibility to receive or continue to receive payments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How the Board decides what is convincing evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When the Board receives evidence, a Board representative examines it to see if it is convincing evidence. If it is, no other evidence is needed. In deciding whether the evidence is convincing, the Board representative decides whether—</P>
              <P>(a) The information contained in the evidence was given by a person in a position to know the facts;</P>
              <P>(b) There was any reason to give false information when the evidence was created;</P>
              <P>(c) The information contained in the evidence was given under oath, or in the presence of witnesses, or with the knowledge that there was a penalty for giving false information;</P>
              <P>(d) The evidence was created at the time the event took place or shortly after;</P>
              <P>(e) The evidence has been altered or has any erasures on it; and</P>
              <P>(f) The information contained in the evidence agrees with other available evidence, including existing Board records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preferred evidence and other evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preferred evidence.</E> When a claimant submits the type of evidence shown as preferred in subparts B and C of this part, the Board will generally find it is convincing evidence. This means that unless there is information in the Board's records that raises a doubt about the evidence, other evidence to prove the same fact will not be needed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other evidence.</E> If preferred evidence is not available, the Board will consider any other evidence a claimant <PRTPAGE P="273"/>furnishes. If the other evidence consists of several different records or documents which all show the same information, the Board may determine that it is convincing evidence even though it is not preferred evidence. If the other evidence is not convincing by itself, the claimant will be asked to submit additional evidence. If the additional evidence shows the same information all the evidence considered together may be convincing evidence.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Board decision.</E> When the Board has convincing evidence of the facts that must be proven, or when it is clear that the evidence provided does not prove the necessary facts, the Board will make a formal decision about the applicant's rights to benefits.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Claimants other than child or parent.</E> When any person other than a child or parent applies for benefits due because of the employee's death or because of the death of a beneficiary, the Board may ask the claimant for evidence of relationship.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Evidence required.</E> The type of evidence required is dependent upon the amount payable and the claimant's relationship to the deceased employee or beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">More than one eligible and claimants agree on relationship.</E> If there is more than one person eligible for benefits, and all eligible persons agree on the relationship of each other eligible person, only one of the persons will be asked to furnish proof of relationship. For example, if brothers and sisters of a deceased employee file applications for the residual lump sum or annuity payments due but unpaid at death, only one of them need file proof of relationship if their applications indicate that there is no dispute as to who are the brothers and sisters of the employee.</P>

              <P>(a) The employee's spouse applies for a spouse's annuity as a deemed spouse; or</P>
              <P>(b) The employee's legal widow or widower applies for a lump-sum death payment, annuity payments due the employee but unpaid at death, or a residual lump-sum death payment on the basis of that relationship, or the employee's deemed widow or widower applies for a widow's or widower's annuity.</P>

              <P>The following evidence may be required:</P>
              <P>(a) If the employee is alive, both the employee and his or her spouse must sign a statement that they are living together in the same household when the spouse applies for a spouse's annuity as a deemed spouse.</P>

              <P>(c) If the employee and spouse, widow or widower were temporarily living apart, a signed statement is required explaining where each was living, how long the separation lasted, and the reason for separation. If more evidence is required to remove any reasonable doubt about the temporary nature of the separation, the Board may ask for sworn statements of other persons having personal knowledge of the facts or for other convincing evidence.</P>
              <P>(d) If the employee and spouse, widow, or widower were not living in the same household, the Board may ask for evidence that the employee was contributing to or under court order to contribute to the support of his or her spouse, widow, or widower. Evidence of contributions or a certified copy of the order for support may be requested. The court order for support must be in effect on the day the spouse applies for a spouse's annuity or, if the employee is dead, the day of the employee's death. This type of evidence does not apply for purposes of establishing a deemed valid marriage. (See part 222 of this chapter.) A deemed spouse, widow, or widower must furnish evidence as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction of part.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part explains how disability determinations are made by the Railroad Retirement Board. In some determinations of disability entitlement, as described below, the Board makes the decision of disability under the Railroad Retirement Act based on the regulations set out in this part. However, in certain other determinations of disability entitlement (as also described below) the Board has the authority to decide whether the claimant is disabled as that term is defined in the Social Security Act and the regulations of the Social Security Administration.</P>
              <P>(b) In order for a claimant to become entitled to a railroad retirement annuity based on disability for his or her regular railroad occupation, or to become entitled to a railroad retirement annuity based on disability for any regular employment as an employee, widow(er), or child, he or she must be disabled as those terms are defined in the Railroad Retirement Act. In order for a claimant to become entitled to a period of disability, to early Medicare coverage based on disability, to benefits under the social security overall minimum, or to a disability annuity as a surviving divorced spouse or remarried widow(er), the claimant must be found disabled as that term is defined in the Social Security Act.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 220.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>The basis for the Board's disability decision.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Board makes disability decisions for claims of disability under the Railroad Retirement Act. These decisions are based either on the rules contained in the Board's regulations in this part or the rules contained in the regulations of the Social Security Administration, whichever is controlling.</P>
              <P>(b) A disability decision is made only if the claimant meets other basic eligibility requirements for the specific disability benefit for which he or she is applying. For example, a claimant for an occupational disability annuity must first meet the eligibility requirements for that annuity, as explained in part 216 of this chapter, in order for the Board to make a disability decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disability for work in an employee's regular railroad occupation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to receive an occupational disability annuity an eligible employee must be found by the Board to be disabled for work in his or her regular railroad occupation because of a permanent physical or mental impairment. In this subpart the Board describes in general terms how it evaluates a claim for an occupational disability annuity. In accordance with section 2(a)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act this subpart was developed with the cooperation of employers and employees. This subpart is supplemented by an Occupational Disability Claims Manual (Manual) <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> which was also developed with the cooperation of employers and employees.</P>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(b) In accordance with section 2(a)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board shall select two physicians, one from recommendations made by representatives of employers and one from recommendations made by representatives of employees. These individuals shall comprise the Occupational Disability Advisory Committee (Committee). This Committee shall periodically review, as necessary, this subpart and the Manual and make recommendations to the Board with respect to amendments to this subpart or to the Manual. The Board shall confer with the Committee before it amends either this subpart or the Manual.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishment of permanent disability for work in regular railroad occupation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Board will presume that a claimant who is not allowed to continue working for medical reasons by his employer has been found, under standards contained in this subpart, disabled unless the Board finds that no person could reasonably conclude on the basis of evidence presented that the claimant can no longer perform his or her regular railroad occupation for medical reasons. (See § 220.21 if the claimant is not currently disabled, but was previously occupationally disabled for a specified period of time in the past). The Board uses the following evaluation process in determining disability for work in the regular occupation:</P>
              <P>(a) The Board evaluates the employee's medically documented physical and mental impairment(s) to determine if the employee is medically disabled. In order to be found medically disabled, the employee's impairments must be severe enough to prevent a person from doing any substantial gainful activity. The Board makes this determination based on the guidelines set out in § 220.100(b)(3). If the Board finds that an employee has an impairment which is medically disabling, it will find the employee disabled for work in his or her regular occupation without considering the duties of his or her regular occupation.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Board finds that the claimant does not have an impairment described in paragraph (a) of this section, it will—</P>
              <P>(1) Determine the employee's regular railroad occupation, as defined in § 220.11, based upon the employee's own description of his or her job;</P>
              <P>(2) Evaluate whether the claimant is disabled as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The Board first determines whether the employee's regular railroad occupation is an occupation covered under appendix 3 of this part. Second, the Board will determine whether the employee's claimed impairment(s) is covered under appendix 3 of this part. If claimant's regular railroad occupation or impairment(s) is not covered under appendix 3 of this part, then the Board will determine if the employee is disabled under ICE as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) If the Board determines that, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, appendix 3 of this part applies, then the Board will confirm the existence of the employee's impairment(s) using—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The “highly recommended” and “recommended” tests set forth in appendix 3 of this part that relate to the body part affected by the claimant's impairment(s); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) By using valid diagnostic tests accepted by the medical community as described in § 220.27.</P>

              <P>(B) If the employee's impairment(s) cannot be confirmed because there are significant differences in objective tests such as imaging study, electrocardiograms or other test results, and these differences cannot be readily resolved, the Board will determine if the employee is disabled under ICE as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. However, if the employee's impairment(s) cannot be confirmed, and there are no significant differences in objective medical tests which cannot be readily resolved, then the employee will be found not disabled.<PRTPAGE P="287"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Once the impairment(s) is confirmed, as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Board will apply appendix 3 of this part. If appendix 3 of this part dictates a “D” (disabled) finding, the Board will find the claimant disabled.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the Board does not find the employee disabled using the standards in appendix 3 of this part, then the Board will determine if the employee is disabled using ICE. To evaluate a claim under ICE the Board will use the following steps:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> The Board will determine if the medical evidence is complete. Under this step the Board may request the claimant to take additional medical tests such as a functional capacity test or other consultative examinations;</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> If the employee's impairment(s) has not been confirmed, as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, the Board will next confirm the employee's impairment(s), as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section;</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> The Board will determine whether the opinions among the physicians regarding medical findings are consistent, by reviewing the employee's medical history, physical and mental examination findings, laboratory or other test results, and other information provided by the employee or obtained by the Board. If such records reveal that there are significant differences in the medical findings, significant differences in opinions concerning the residual functional capacity evaluations among treating physicians, or significant differences between the results of functional capacity evaluations and residual functional capacity examinations, then the Board may request additional evidence from treating physicians, additional consultative examinations and/or residual functional capacity tests to resolve the inconsistencies;</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Step 4.</E> When the Board determines that there is concordance of medical findings, then the Board will assess the quality of the evidence in accordance with § 220.112, which describes the weight to be given to the opinions of various physicians, and § 220.114, which describes how the Board evaluates symptoms such as pain. The Board will also assess the weight of evidence by utilizing § 220.14, which outlines factors to be used in determining the weight to be attributed to certain types of evidence. If, after assessment, the Board determines that there is no substantial objective evidence of an impairment, the Board will determine that the employee is not disabled;</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Step 5.</E> Next, the Board determines the physical and mental demands of the employee's regular railroad occupation. In determining the job demands of the employee's regular railroad occupation, the Board will not only consider the employee's own description of his or her regular railroad occupation, but shall also consider the employer's description of the physical requirements and environmental factors relating to the employee's regular railroad occupation, as provided by the employer on the appropriate form set forth in appendix 3 of this part, and consult other sources such as the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and the job descriptions of occupations found in the Occupational Disability Claims Manual, as provided for in § 220.10;</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Step 6.</E> Based upon the assessment of the evidence in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, the Board shall determine the employee's residual functional capacity. The Board will then compare the job demands of the employee's regular railroad occupation, as determined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(E) of this section. If the demands of the employee's regular railroad occupation exceed the employee's residual functional capacity, then the Board will find the employee disabled. If the demands do not exceed the employee's residual functional capacity, then the Board will find the employee not disabled.</P>

              <P>(2) The annuitant demonstrates the ability to perform the duties of his or her regular occupation. The Board provides a trial work period before terminating a disability annuity because of the annuitant's return to work.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of the trial work period.</E> The trial work period is a period during which the annuitant may test his or her ability to work and still be considered occupationally disabled. It begins and ends as described in paragraph (e) of this section. During this period, the annuitant may perform “services” (see paragraph (c) of this section) in as <PRTPAGE P="289"/>many as 9 months, but these months do not have to be consecutive. The Board will not consider those services as showing that the annuitant's occupational disability has ended until the annuitant has performed services in at least 9 months. However, after the trial work period has ended, the Board will consider the work the annuitant did during the trial work period in determining whether the annuitant's occupational disability has ended at any time after the trial work period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What the Board means by services in an occupational disability case.</E> When used in this section, “services” means any activity which, even though it may not be substantial gainful activity as defined in § 220.141, is—</P>
              <P>(1) Done by a person in employment or self-employment for pay or profit, or is the kind normally done for pay or profit; and</P>

              <P>(i) The ninth month (whether or not the months have been consecutive) in which the annuitant performed services; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The month in which new evidence, other than evidence relating to any work the annuitant did during the trial work period, shows that the annuitant is not disabled, even though the annuitant has not worked a full nine months.

              <P>(a) In some cases, the Board may determine that a claimant is not currently disabled for work in his or her regular occupation but was previously disabled for a specified period of time in the past. This can occur when—</P>
              <P>(1) The disability application was filed before the claimant's occupational disability ended, but the Board did not make the initial determination of occupational disability until after the claimant's disability ended; or</P>
              <P>(2) The disability application was filed after the claimant's occupational disability ended but no later than the 12th month after the month the disability ended.</P>

              <P>(b) When evaluating a claim for a previous occupational disability, the Board follows the steps in § 220.13 to determine whether an occupational disability existed, and follows the steps in §§ 220.16 and 220.17 to determine when the occupational disability ended.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>The claimant sustained multiple fractures to his left leg in an automobile accident which occurred on June 16, 1982. For a period of 18 months following the accident the claimant underwent 2 surgical procedures which restored the functional use of his leg. After a recovery period following the last surgery, the claimant returned to his regular railroad job on February 1, 1984. The claimant, although fully recovered medically and regularly employed, filed an application on December 3, 1984 for a determination of occupational disability for the period June 16, 1982 through January 31, 1984. The Board reviewed his claim in January 1985 and determined that he was occupationally disabled for the prior period which began on June 16, 1982 and continued through January 31, 1984. A disability annuity is payable to the employee only for the period December 1, 1983 through January 31, 1984.

              <P>An employee, widow(er), or child is disabled for any regular employment if he or she is unable to do any substantial gainful activity because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which meets the duration requirement defined in § 220.28. In the case of a widow(er), the permanent physical or mental impairment must have prevented work in any regular employment before the end of a specific period (see § 220.30). In the case of a child, the permanent physical or mental impairment must have prevented work in any regular employment since before age 22. To meet this definition of disability, a claimant must have a severe impairment, which makes him or her unable to do any previous work or other substantial gainful activity which exists in the national economy. To determine whether a claimant is able to do any other work, the Board considers a claimant's residual functional capacity, age, education and work experience. See § 220.100 for <PRTPAGE P="291"/>the process by which the Board evaluates disability for any regular employment. This process applies to employees, widow(er)s, or children who apply for annuities based on disability for any regular employment. This process does not apply to surviving divorced spouses or remarried widow(er)s who apply for annuities based on disability.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In addition to its authority to decide whether a claimant is disabled under the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board has authority in certain instances to decide whether a claimant is disabled as that term is defined in the Social Security Act. In making these decisions the Board must apply the regulations of the Social Security Administration in the same manner as does the Secretary of Health and Human Services in making disability decisions under the Social Security Act. Regulations of the Social Security Administration concerning disability are found at part 404, subpart P of this title.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Period of disability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In order to receive an annuity based upon a disability, an employee must be found disabled under the Railroad Retirement Act. If an employee is found disabled under the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board will determine whether he is disabled under the Social Security Act to qualify for a period of disability as defined in that Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Period of disability</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition and effect.</E> A period of disability is a continuous period of time during which an employee is disabled as that term is defined in § 404.1505 of this title. A period of disability established by the Board—</P>
              <P>(i) Preserves the disabled employee's earnings record as it is when the period begins;</P>
              <P>(ii) Protects the insured status required for entitlement to social security overall minimum;</P>
              <P>(iii) May cause an increase in the rate of an employee, spouse, or survivor annuity; or</P>
              <P>(iv) May permit a disabled employee to receive Medicare benefits in addition to an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect on benefits.</E> The establishment of a period of disability for the employee will never cause a denial or <PRTPAGE P="292"/>reduction in benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act or Social Security Act, but it will always be used to establish Medicare entitlement before age 65.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Who may establish a period of disability.</E> The Railroad Retirement Board or the Social Security Administration may establish a period of disability. However, the decision of one agency is not binding upon the other agency.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">When the Board may establish a period of disability.</E> The Board has independent authority to decide whether or not to establish a period of disability for any employee who was awarded an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act, or who—</P>
              <P>(i) Has applied for a disability annuity; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Has at least 10 years of railroad service.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">When an employee is entitled to a period of disability.</E> An employee is entitled to a period of disability if he or she meets the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The employee is disabled under the Social Security Act, as described in § 404.1505 of this title.</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee is insured for a period of disability under § 404.130 of this title based on combined railroad and social security earnings.</P>
              <P>(iii) The employee files an application as shown in subparagraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) At least 5 consecutive months elapse from the month in which the period of disability begins and before the month in which it would end.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Application for a period of disability.</E> (i) An application for an employee disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act or an employee disability benefit under the Social Security Act is also an application for a period of disability.</P>
              <P>(ii) An employee who is receiving an age annuity or who was previously denied a period of disability must file a separate application for a period of disability.</P>
              <P>(iii) In order to be entitled to a period of disability, an employee must apply while he or she is disabled or not later than 12 months after the month in which the period of disability ends.</P>
              <P>(iv) An employee who is unable to apply within the 12-month period after the period of disability ends because his or her physical condition limited his or her activities to the extent that he or she could not complete and sign an application or because he or she was mentally incompetent, may apply no later than 36 months after the period of disability ends.</P>
              <P>(v) A period of disability can also be established on the basis of an application filed within 3 months after the month a disabled employee died.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Social security overall minimum.</E> The social security overall minimum provision of the Railroad Retirement Act guarantees that the total monthly annuities payable to an employee and his or her family will not be less than the total monthly benefit which would be payable under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service were credited as employment under the Social Security Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Providing evidence of disability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The claimant for a disability annuity is responsible for providing evidence of the claimed disability and the effect of the disability on the ability to work. The Board will assist the claimant, when necessary, in obtaining the required evidence. At its discretion, the Board will arrange for an examination by a consultant at the expense of the Board as explained in §§ 220.50 and 220.51.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Kind of evidence.</E> The claimant must provide medical evidence showing that he or she has an impairment(s) and how severe it is during the time the claimant claims to be disabled. The Board will consider only impairment(s) the claimant claims to have or about which the Board receives evidence. Before deciding that the claimant is not disabled, the Board will develop a complete medical history (i.e., evidence from the records of the claimant's medical sources) covering at least the preceding 12 months, unless the claimant says that his or her disability began less than 12 months before he or she filed an application. The Board will make every reasonable effort to help the claimant in getting medical reports from his or her own medical sources when the claimant gives the Board permission to request them. Every reasonable effort means that the Board will make an initial request and, after 20 days, one follow-up request to the claimant's medical source to obtain the medical evidence necessary to make a determination before the Board evaluates medical evidence obtained from another source on a consultative basis. The medical source will have 10 days from the follow-up request to reply (unless experience indicates that a longer period is advisable in a particular case). In order to expedite processing the Board may order a consultative exam from a non-treating source while awaiting receipt of medical source evidence. If the Board ask the claimant to do so, he or she must contact the medical sources to help us get the medical reports. The Board may also ask the claimant to provide evidence about his or her—</P>
              <P>(1) Age;</P>
              <P>(2) Education and training;</P>
              <P>(3) Work experience;</P>
              <P>(4) Daily activities both before and after the date the claimant says that he or she became disabled;</P>
              <P>(5) Efforts to work; and</P>
              <P>(6) Any other evidence showing how the claimant's impairment(s) affects his or her ability to work. (In §§ 220.125 through 220.134, we discuss in more detail the evidence the Board needs when it considers vocational factors.)</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acceptable sources.</E> The Board needs reports about the claimant's impairment(s) from acceptable medical sources. Acceptable medical sources are—</P>
              <P>(1) Licensed physicians;</P>
              <P>(2) Licensed osteopaths;</P>
              <P>(3) Licensed or certified psychologists;</P>
              <P>(4) Licensed optometrists for the measurement of visual acuity and visual fields (a report from a physician may be needed to determine other aspects of eye diseases); and</P>

              <P>(5) Persons authorized to furnish a copy or summary of the records of a medical facility. Generally, the copy or <PRTPAGE P="294"/>summary should be certified as accurate by the custodian or by any authorized employee of the Railroad Retirement Board, Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, or State agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical reports.</E> Medical reports should include—</P>
              <P>(1) Medical history;</P>
              <P>(2) Clinical findings (such as the results of physical or mental status examinations);</P>
              <P>(3) Laboratory findings (such as blood pressure, x-rays);</P>
              <P>(4) Diagnosis (statement of disease or injury based on its signs and symptoms);</P>
              <P>(5) Treatment prescribed, with response to treatment and prognosis; and</P>
              <P>(6)(i) Statements about what the claimant can still do despite his or her impairment(s) based on the medical source's findings on the factors under paragraph (b)(1) through (5) of this section (except in disability claims for remarried widow's and surviving divorced spouses). (See § 220.112).</P>
              <P>(ii) Statements about what the claimant can still do (based on the medical source's findings on the factors under paragraph (b)(1) through (5) of this section) should describe—</P>
              <P>(A) The medical source's opinion about the claimant's ability, despite his or her impairment(s), to do work-related activities such as sitting, standing, moving about, lifting, carrying, handling objects, hearing, speaking, and traveling; and</P>
              <P>(B) In cases of mental impairment(s), the medical source's opinion about the claimant's ability to reason or make occupational, personal, or social adjustments. (See § 220.112).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Completeness.</E> The medical evidence, including the clinical and laboratory findings, must be complete and detailed enough to allow the Board to make a determination about whether or not the claimant is disabled. It must allow the Board to determine—</P>
              <P>(1) The nature and limiting effects of the claimant's impairment(s) for any period in question;</P>
              <P>(2) The probable duration of the claimant's impairment(s); and</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant's residual functional capacity to do work-related physical and mental activities.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Evidence from physicians.</E> A statement by or the opinion of the claimant's treating physician will not determine whether the claimant is disabled. However, the medical evidence provided by a treating physician will be considered by the Board in making a disability decision. A treating physician is a doctor to whom the claimant has been going for treatment on a continuing basis. The claimant may have more than one treating physician. The Board may use consulting physicians or other medical consultants for specialized examinations or tests, to obtain more complete evidence, and to resolve any conflicts. A consulting physician is a doctor (often a specialist) to whom the claimant is referred for an examination once or on a limited basis. (See § 220.50 for an explanation of when the Board may request a consultative examination.)</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Information from other sources.</E> Information from other sources may also help the Board understand how an impairment affects the claimant's ability to work. Other sources include—</P>
              <P>(1) Public and private social welfare agencies;</P>
              <P>(2) Observations by nonmedical sources;</P>
              <P>(3) Other practitioners (for example, naturopaths, chiropractors, audiologists, etc.); and</P>

If the individual is already receiving an annuity and does not have a good reason for failing or refusing to take part in a consultative examination or test which the Board arranged, the Board may determine that the individual's disability has stopped because of his or her failure or refusal. The claimant for whom an examination or test has been scheduled should notify the Board as soon as possible before the scheduled date of the examination or test if he or she has any reason why he or she cannot go to the examination or test.

              <SUBJECT>When the Board will purchase a consultative examination and how it will be used.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The decision to purchase a consultative examination for a claimant will be made after full consideration is given to whether the additional information needed (e.g., clinical findings, laboratory tests, diagnosis, and prognosis, etc.) is readily available from the records of the claimant's medical sources. Upon filing an application for a disability annuity, a claimant will be required to obtain from his or her medical source(s) information regarding the claimed impairments. The Board will seek clarification from a medical source who has provided a report when that report contains a conflict or ambiguity, or does not contain all necessary information or when the information supplied is not based on objective evidence. The Board will not, however, seek clarification <PRTPAGE P="296"/>from a medical source when it is clear that the source either cannot or will not provide the necessary findings, or cannot reconcile a conflict or ambiguity in the findings provided from the source's records. Therefore, before purchasing a consultative examination, the Board will consider not only existing medical reports, but also the background report containing the claimant's allegations and information about the claimant's vocational background, as well as other pertinent evidence in his or her file.</P>
              <P>(2) When the Board purchases a consultative examination, we will use the report from the consultative examination to try to resolve a conflict or ambiguity if one exists. The Board will do this by comparing the persuasiveness and value of the evidence. The Board will also use a consultative examination to secure needed medical evidence the file does not contain such as clinical findings, laboratory tests, a diagnosis or prognosis necessary for decision.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Situations requiring a consultative examination.</E> A consultative examination may be purchased when the evidence as a whole, both medical and non-medical, is not sufficient to support a decision on the claim. In addition, other situations, such as one or more of the following, will normally require a consultative examination (these situations are not all-inclusive):</P>
              <P>(1) The specific additional evidence needed for adjudication has been pinpointed and high probability exists for obtaining it through purchase.</P>
              <P>(2) The additional evidence needed is not contained in the records of the claimant's treating sources.</P>
              <P>(3) Evidence that may be needed from the claimant's treating or other medical sources cannot be obtained for reasons beyond his or her control, such as death or noncooperation of the medical source.</P>
              <P>(4) Highly technical or specialized medical evidence which is needed is not available from the claimant's treating sources.</P>
              <P>(5) A conflict, inconsistency, ambiguity or insufficiency in the evidence must be resolved.</P>
              <P>(6) There is an indication of a change in the claimant's condition that is likely to affect his or her ability to function, but current severity is not documented.</P>
              <P>(7) Information provided by any source appears not to be supported by objective evidence.</P>

              <P>(b) Where the evidence tends to substantiate an affirmation of the initial denial but the claimant states that the treating physician or psychologist considers him or her to be disabled, the Board will assist the claimant in securing medical reports or records from the treating physician.</P>

              <P>(a) Where there is a conflict in the medical evidence at the hearing level of review before a hearings officer, the hearings officer will try to resolve it by comparing the persuasiveness and value of the conflicting evidence. The hearings officer's reasoning will be explained in the decision rationale. Where such resolution is not possible, the hearings officer will secure additional medical evidence (e.g., clinical findings, laboratory test, diagnosis, prognosis, etc.) to resolve the conflict. Even in the absence of a conflict, the hearings officer will also secure additional medical evidence when the file does not contain findings, laboratory tests, a diagnosis, or a prognosis necessary for a decision.</P>
              <P>(b) Before requesting a consultative examination, the hearings officer will ascertain whether the information is available as a result of a recent examination by any of the claimant's medical sources. If it is, the hearings officer will request the evidence from that medical practitioner. If contact with the medical source is not productive for any reason, or if there is no recent examination by a medical source, the hearings officer will obtain a consultative examination.</P>

              <P>A claimant or his or her representative may object to his or her being examined by a designated physician or psychologist. If there is a good reason for the objection, the Board will schedule the examination with another physician or psychologist. A good reason may be where the consultative examination physician or psychologist had previously represented an interest adverse to the claimant. For example, the physician or psychologist may have represented the claimant's employer in a worker's compensation case or may have been involved in an insurance claim or legal action adverse to the claimant. Other things the Board will consider are: language barrier, office location of consultative examination physician or psychologist (2nd floor, no elevator, etc.), travel restrictions, and examination by the physician or psychologist in connection with a previous unfavorable determination. If the objection is because a physician or psychologist allegedly “lacks objectivity” (in general, but not in relation to the claimant personally) the Board will review the allegations. To avoid a delay in processing the claimant's claim, the consultative examination in such a case will be changed to another physician or psychologist while a review is being conducted. Any objection to use of the substitute physician or psychologist will be handled in the same manner. However, if the Board or the Social Security Administration had previously conducted such a review and <PRTPAGE P="298"/>found that the reports of the consultative physician or psychologist in question conform to the Board's guidelines, then the Board will not change the claimant's examination.</P>

              <P>Consulting physicians or psychologists will be fully informed at the time the Board contacts them of the following obligations:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In scheduling full consultative examinations, sufficient time should be allowed to permit the examining physician to take a case history and perform the examination (including any needed tests).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Report content.</E> The reported results of the claimant's medical history, examination, pertinent requested laboratory findings, discussions and conclusions must conform to accepted professional standards and practices in the medical field for a complete and competent examination. The facts in a particular case and the information and findings already reported in the medical and other evidence of record will dictate the extent of detail needed in the consultative examination report for that case. Thus, the detail and format for reporting the results of a purchased examination will vary depending upon the type of examination or testing requested. The reporting of information will differ from one type of examination to another when the requested examination relates to the performance of tests such as ventilatory function tests, treadmill exercise tests, or audiological tests. The medical report must be complete enough to help the Board determine the nature, severity, duration of the impairment, and residual functional capacity. Pertinent points in the claimant's medical history, such as a description of chest pain, will reflect the claimant's statements of his or her symptoms, not simply the physician's or psychologist's statements or conclusions. The examining physician's or psychologist's report of the consultative examination will include the objective medical facts.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Elements of a complete examination.</E> A complete examination is one which involves all the elements of a standard examination in the applicable medical specialty. When a complete examination is involved, the report will include the following elements:</P>
              <P>(1) The claimant's major or chief complaint(s).</P>
              <P>(2) A detailed description, within the area of speciality of the examination, of the history of the claimant's major complaint(s).</P>
              <P>(3) A description, and disposition, of pertinent “positive,” as well as “negative,” detailed findings based on the history, examination and laboratory test(s) related to the major complaint(s) and any other abnormalities reported or found during examination or laboratory testing.</P>
              <P>(4) The results of laboratory and other tests (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> x-rays) performed according to the requirements stated in the Board's directions to the examining physician or psychologist.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) The diagnosis and prognosis for the claimant's impairment(s).</P>
              <P>(6) A statement as to what the claimant can still do despite his or her impairment(s) (except in disability claims for remarried widows and widowers, and surviving divorced spouses). This statement must describe the consultative physician's or psychologist's opinion concerning the claimant's ability, despite his or her impairment(s), to do basic work activities such as sitting, standing, lifting, carrying, handling objects, hearing, speaking, and traveling: and, in cases of mental impairment(s), the consultative physician's or psychologist's opinion as to the claimant's ability to reason or make occupational, personal, or social adjustments.</P>
              <P>(7) When less than a complete examination is required (for example, a specific test or study is needed), not every element is required.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Signature requirements.</E> All consultative examination reports will be personally reviewed and signed by the physician or psychologist who actually performed the examination. This attests to the fact that the physician or psychologist doing the examination or testing is solely responsible for the report contents and for the conclusions, explanations or comments provided with respect to the history, examination and evaluation of laboratory test results.</P>

Board review physicians or psychologists will not perform consultative examinations for the Board's disability programs without prior approval. In addition, they will not acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, including any member of their families, any financial interest in a medical partnership or similar relationship in which consultative examinations are provided. Sometimes one of the Board's review physicians or psychologists will have prior knowledge of a case (e.g., the claimant was a patient). Where this is so, the physician or psychologist will not participate in the review or determination of the <PRTPAGE P="300"/>case. This does not preclude the physician or psychologist from submitting medical evidence based on prior treatment or examination of the claimant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation of disability for any regular employment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board uses a set evaluation process, explained in paragraph (b) of this section, to determine whether a claimant is disabled for any regular employment. This evaluation process applies to employees, widow(er)s, and children who have applied for annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act based on disability for any regular employment. Regular employment means substantial gainful activity as that term is defined in § 220.141.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Steps in evaluating disability.</E> A set order is followed to determine whether disability exists. The duration requirement, as described in § 220.28, must be met for a claimant to be found disabled. The Board reviews any current work activity, the severity of the claimant's impairment(s), the claimant's residual functional capacity, and the claimant's age, education, and work experience. If the Board finds that the claimant is disabled or is not disabled at any step in the process, the Board does not review further. (See § 220.105 if the claimant is not currently disabled but was previously disabled for a specified period of time in the past.) The steps are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Claimant is working.</E> If the claimant is working, and the work is substantial gainful activity, the Board will find that he or she is not disabled regardless of his or her impairments, age, education, or work experience. If the claimant is not performing substantial gainful activity, the Board will follow paragraph (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Impairment(s) not severe.</E> If the claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limit his or her physical or mental ability to do basic work activities, the Board will find that the claimant is not disabled without consideration of age, education, or work experience. If the claimant has an impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limit his or her ability to do basic work activities, the Board will follow paragraph (3) of this section. (See § 220.102(b) for a definition of basic work activities.)</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Impairment(s) is medically disabling.</E> If the claimant has an impairment or a combination of impairments which meets the duration requirement and which the Board finds is medically disabling, the Board will find the claimant disabled without considering his or her age, education or work experience. In determining whether an impairment or combination of impairments is medically disabling, the Board will consider factors such as the nature and limiting effects of the impairment(s); the effects of the treatment the claimant has undergone, is undergoing, and/or will continue to undergo; the prognosis for the claimant; medical records furnished in support of the claimant's claim; whether the severity of the impairment(s) would fall within any of <PRTPAGE P="301"/>the impairments included in the Listing of Impairments as issued by the Social Security Administration and as amended from time to time (20 CFR part 404, subpart P, appendix 1); or whether the impairment(s) meet such other criteria which the agency by administrative ruling of general applicability has determined to be medically disabling.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Impairment(s) must prevent past relevant work.</E> If the claimant's impairment or combination of impairments is not medically disabling, the Board will then review the claimant's residual functional capacity (<E T="03">see</E> § 220.120) and the physical and mental demands of past relevant work (see § 220.130). If the Board determines that the claimant is still able to do his or her past relevant work, the Board will find that he or she is not disabled. If the claimant is unable to do his or her past relevant work, the Board will follow paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Impairment(s) must prevent any other work.</E> (i) If the claimant is unable to do his or her past relevant work because of his or her impairment or combination of impairments, the Board will review the claimant's residual functional capacity and his or her age, education and work experience to determine if the claimant is able to do any other work. If the claimant cannot do other work, the Board will find him or her disabled. If the claimant can do other work, the Board will find the claimant not disabled.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the claimant has only a marginal education (see § 220.129) and long work experience (i.e., 35 years or more) in which he or she only did arduous unskilled physical labor, and the claimant can no longer do this kind of work, the Board will use a different rule (see § 220.127) to determine disability.</P>
              <P>(c) Once a claimant has been found eligible to receive a disability annuity, the Board follows a somewhat different order of evaluation to determine whether the claimant's eligibility continues as explained in § 220.180.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The steps outlined in § 220.100 apply to the evaluation of physical and mental impairments. In addition, in evaluating the severity of a mental impairment(s), the Board will follow a special procedure at each administrative level of review. Following this procedure will assist the Board in—</P>
              <P>(1) Identifying additional evidence necessary for the determination of impairment severity;</P>
              <P>(2) Considering and evaluating aspects of the mental impairment(s) relevant to the claimant's ability to work; and</P>
              <P>(3) Organizing and presenting the findings in a clear, concise, and consistent manner.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of the procedure to record pertinent findings and rate the degree of functional loss.</E> (1) This procedure requires the Board to record the pertinent signs, symptoms, findings, functional limitations, and effects of treatment contained in the claimant's case record. This will assist the Board in determining if a mental impairment(s) exists. Whether or not a mental impairment(s) exists is decided in the same way the question of a physical impairment is decided, i.e., the evidence must be carefully reviewed and conclusions supported by it. The mental status examination and psychiatric history will ordinarily provide the needed information. (See § 220.27 for further information about what is needed to show an impairment.)</P>
              <P>(2) If the Board determines that a mental impairment(s) exists, this procedure then requires the Board to indicate whether certain medical findings which have been found especially relevant to the ability to work are present or absent.</P>

              <P>(3) The procedure then requires the Board to rate the degree of functional loss resulting from the impairment(s). Four areas of function considered by the Board as essential to work have been identified, and the degree of functional loss in those areas must be rated on a scale that ranges from no limitation to a level of severity which is incompatible with the ability to perform those work-related functions.<PRTPAGE P="302"/>
              </P>
              <FP>For the first two areas (activities of daily living and social functioning), the rating is done based upon the following five-point scale; none, slight, moderate, marked, and extreme. For the third area (concentration, persistence, or pace), the following five-point scale is used: never, seldom, often, frequent, and constant. For the fourth area (deterioration or decompensation in work or work-like settings), the following four-point scale is used: never, once or twice, repeated (three or more), and continual. The last two points for each of these scales represent a degree of limitation which is incompatible with the ability to perform the work-related function.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of the procedure to evaluate mental impairments.</E> Following the rating of the degree of functional loss resulting from the impairment(s), the Board then determines the severity of the mental impairment(s).</P>
              <P>(1) If the four areas considered by the Board as essential to work have been rated to indicate a degree of limitation as “none” or “slight” in the first and second area, “never” or “seldom” in the third area, and “never” in the fourth area, the Board can generally conclude that the impairment(s) is not severe, unless the evidence otherwise indicates that there is significant limitation of the claimant's mental ability to do basic work activities (see § 220.102).</P>
              <P>(2) If the claimant's mental impairment(s) is severe, the Board must then determine if it is medically disabling using the Board's prior conclusions based on this procedure (i.e., the presence of certain medical findings considered by the Board as especially relevant to a claimant's ability to work and the Board's rating of functional loss resulting from the mental impairment(s)).</P>
              <P>(3) If the claimant has a severe impairment(s), but the impairment(s) is not medically disabling, the Board will then do a residual functional capacity assessment for those claimants (employees, widow(er)s, and children) whose applications are based on disability for any regular employment under the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>
              <P>(4) At all adjudicative levels, the Board will, in each case, incorporate the pertinent findings and conclusions based on this procedure in its decision rationale. The Board's rationale must show the significant history, including examination, laboratory findings, and functional limitations that the Board considered in reaching conclusions about the severity of the mental impairment(s).</P>

              <P>(1) The disability application was filed before the claimant's disability ended but the Board did not make the initial determination of disability until after the claimant's disability ended; or</P>
              <P>(2) The disability application was filed after the claimant's disability ended but no later than the 12th month after the month the disability ended.</P>

              <P>(b) When evaluating a claim for a previous disability, the Board follows the steps in § 220.100 to determine whether a disability existed, and follows the steps in § 220.180 to determine when the disability ended.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>The claimant sustained multiple fractures to his left leg in an automobile accident which occurred on June 16, 1982. For a period of 18 months following the accident the claimant underwent 2 surgical procedures which restored the functional use of his leg. After a recovery period following the last surgery, the claimant returned to work on February 1, 1984.</P>
                <P>The claimant, although fully recovered medically and regularly employed, filed an application on December 3, 1984 for a determination of disability for the period June 16, 1982 through January 31, 1984. The Board reviewed his claim in January 1985 and determined that he was disabled for the prior period which began June 16, 1982 and continued through January 31, 1984. A disability annuity is payable to the employee only for the period December 1, 1983 through January 31, 1984.</P>

              <P>(a) “<E T="03">Medically disabled.”</E> The term “medically disabled ”refers to disability based solely on impairment(s) which are considered to be so medically severe as to prevent a person from doing any substantial gainful activity. The Board will base its decision about whether the claimant's impairment(s) is medically disabling on medical evidence only, without consideration of the claimant's residual functional capacity, age, education or work experience. The Board will also consider the medical opinion given by one or more physicians employed or engaged by the Board or the Social Security Administration to make medical judgments. The medical evidence used to establish a diagnosis or confirm the existence of an impairment, and to establish the severity of the impairment includes medical findings consisting of signs, symptoms and laboratory findings. The medical findings must be <PRTPAGE P="304"/>based on medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. If the claimant has more than one impairment, but none of the impairments, by themselves, is medically disabling, the Board will review the signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of all of the impairments to determine whether the combination of impairments is medically disabling. In general, impairments that the Board considers to be medically disabling are:</P>
              <P>(1) Permanent;</P>
              <P>(2) Expected to result in death; or</P>
              <P>(3) Have a specific length of duration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Diagnosis of impairments.</E> A diagnosis of a particular impairment is not sufficient for a finding of medical disability, unless the diagnosis is supported by medical findings that are based on medically acceptable clinical and laboratory techniques.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Addiction to alcohol or drugs.</E> If a claimant has a condition diagnosed as addiction to alcohol or drugs, this condition will not, by itself, be a basis for determining whether the claimant is, or is not, disabled. As with any other medical condition, the Board will decide whether the claimant is disabled based on symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conclusions by physicians concerning the claimant's disability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under the statute, the Board is responsible for making the decision about whether a claimant meets the statutory definition of disability. A claimant can only be found disabled if he or she is unable to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. (See § 220.28). A claimant's impairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. (See § 220.27). The decision as to whether a claimant is disabled may involve more than medical considerations and the Board may have to consider such factors as age, education and past work experience. Such vocational factors are not within the expertise of medical sources.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical opinions that are conclusive.</E> A medical opinion by a treating source will be conclusive as to the medical issues of the nature and severity of a claimant's impairment(s) where the Board finds that (1) it is fully supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and (2) it is not inconsistent with the other substantial medical evidence of record. A medical opinion that is not fully supported will not be conclusive.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical opinions that are not fully supported.</E> If an opinion by a treating source(s) is not fully supported, the Board will make every reasonable effort (i.e., an initial request and, after 20 days, one follow-up request) to obtain from the claimant's treating source(s) the relevant evidence that supports the medical opinion(s) before the Board makes a determination as to whether a claimant is disabled.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>In a case involving an organic mental disorder caused by trauma to the head, a consultative physician, upon interview with the claimant, found only mild disorientation as to time and place. The claimant's treating physician reports that the claimant, as the result of his impairment, has severe disorientation as to time and place. The treating physician supplies office notes which follow the course of the claimant's illness from the date of injury to the present. These notes indicate that the claimant's condition is such that he has some “good days” on which he appears to be unimpaired, but generally support the treating physician's opinion that the claimant is severely impaired. In this case the treating physician's opinion will be given some weight over that of the consultative physician.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inconsistent medical opinions.</E> Where the Board finds that the opinion of a treating source regarding medical issues is inconsistent with the evidence of record, including opinions of other sources that are supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, the Board must resolve the inconsistency. If necessary to resolve the inconsistency, the <PRTPAGE P="305"/>Board will secure additional independent evidence and/or further interpretation or explanation from the treating source(s) and/or the consultative physician or psychologist. The Board's determination will be based on all the evidence in the case record, including the opinions of the medical sources. In resolving an inconsistency, the Board will give some extra weight to the treating source's supported opinion(s) which interprets the medical findings about the nature and severity of the impairment(s).
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>In a case involving arthritis of the shoulder, where the X-rays confirm bone destruction, the examinations indicate minimal swelling and inflammation, but the treating source supplies evidence of greater restriction in the range of motion than found by the consultative physician, the Board will ask the treating source for further interpretation of the range of motion studies. If the treating source supplies a reasonable explanation. e.g., that the individual's condition is subject to periods of aggravation, the treating source's explanation will be given some extra weight over that of the consultative physician.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Medical opinions that will not be considered conclusive nor given extra weight.</E> The Board will not consider as conclusive nor give extra weight to medical opinions which are not in accord with the statutory or regulatory standards for establishing disability. Thus, opinions that the individual's impairments are medically disabling where the medical findings which are the basis for that conclusion would not support an impairment so severe as to preclude any substantial gainful activity will not be conclusive nor given extra weight. Likewise, an opinion(s) as to the individual's residual functional capacity which is not in accord with regulatory requirements set forth in §§ 220.120 and 220.121 will not be conclusive nor given extra weight.

                <P>A medical opinion states that a claimant is disabled based on blindness, but findings show functional visual accuity in the better eye, after best correction, of 20/100. That medical opinion would not be conclusive or given extra weight.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation of symptoms, including pain.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In determining whether the claimant is disabled, the Board considers all of the claimant's symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which the claimant's symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence. By objective medical evidence, the Board means medical signs and laboratory findings as defined in §§ 220.113(b) and (c) of this part. By other evidence, the Board means the kinds of evidence described in §§ 220.45 and 220.46 of this part. These include statements or reports from the <PRTPAGE P="306"/>claimant, the claimant's treating or examining physician or psychologist, and others about the claimant's medical history, diagnosis, prescribed treatment, daily activities, efforts to work, and any other evidence showing how the claimant's impairment(s) and any related symptoms affect the claimant's ability to work. The Board will consider all of the claimant's statements about his or her symptoms, such as pain, and any description by the claimant, the claimant's physician, or psychologist, or other persons about how the symptoms affect the claimant's activities of daily living and ability to work. However, statements alone about the claimant's pain or other symptoms will not establish that the claimant is disabled; there must be medical signs and laboratory findings which show that the claimant has a medical impairment(s) which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged and which, when considered with all of the other evidence (including statements about the intensity and persistence of the claimant's pain or other symptoms which may reasonably be accepted as consistent with the medical signs and laboratory findings), would lead to a conclusion that the claimant is disabled. In evaluating the intensity and persistence of the claimant's symptoms, including pain, the Board will consider all of the available evidence, including the claimant's medical history, the medical signs and laboratory findings and statements about how the claimant's symptoms affect the claimant. (Section 220.112(b) of this part explains how the Board considers opinions of the claimant's treating source and other medical opinions on the existence and severity of the claimant's symptoms, such as pain.) The Board will then determine the extent to which the claimant's alleged functional limitations and restrictions due to pain or other symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the medical signs and laboratory findings and other evidence to decide how the claimant's symptoms affect the claimant's ability to work.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Need for medically determinable impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce symptoms, such as pain.</E> The claimant's symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness, or nervousness, will not be found to affect the claimant's ability to do basic work activities unless medical signs or laboratory findings show that a medically determinable impairment(s) is present. Medical signs and laboratory findings, established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques, must show the existence of a medical impairment(s) which results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities and which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged. The finding that the claimant's impairment(s) could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant's pain or other symptoms does not involve a determination as to the intensity, persistence, or functionally limiting effects of the claimant's symptoms. The Board will develop evidence regarding the possibility of a medically determinable mental impairment when the Board has information to suggest that such an impairment exists, and the claimant alleges pain or other symptoms but the medical signs and laboratory findings do not substantiate any physical impairment(s) capable of producing the pain or other symptoms.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluating the intensity and persistence of symptoms, such as pain, and determining the extent to which the claimant's symptoms limit his or her capacity for work</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> When the medical signs or laboratory findings show that the claimant has a medically determinable impairment(s) that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant's symptoms, such as pain, the Board must then evaluate the intensity and persistence of the claimant's symptoms so that it can determine how the claimant's symptoms limit the claimant's capacity for work. In evaluating the intensity and persistence of the claimant's symptoms, the Board considers all of the available evidence, including the claimant's medical history, the medical signs and laboratory findings, and statements from the claimant, the claimant's treating or examining physician or psychologist, or other persons about how the claimant's symptoms affect the claimant. The <PRTPAGE P="307"/>Board also considers the medical opinions of the claimant's treating source and other medical opinions as explained in § 220.112 of this part. Paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section explain further how the Board evaluates the intensity and persistence of the claimant's symptoms and how it determines the extent to which the claimant's symptoms limit the claimant's capacity for work, when the medical signs or laboratory findings show that the claimant has a medically determinable impairment(s) that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant's symptoms, such as pain.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Consideration of objective medical evidence.</E> Objective medical evidence is evidence obtained from the application of medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, such as evidence of reduced joint motion, muscle spasm, sensory deficit or motor disruption. Objective medical evidence of this type is a useful indicator to assist the Board in making reasonable conclusions about the intensity and persistence of the claimant's symptoms and the effect those symptoms, such as pain, may have on the claimant's ability to work. The Board must always attempt to obtain objective medical evidence and, when it is obtained, the Board will consider it in reaching a conclusion as to whether the claimant is disabled. However, the Board will not reject the claimant's statements about the intensity and persistence of the claimant's pain or other symptoms or about the effect the claimant's symptoms have on the claimant's ability to work solely because the available objective medical evidence does not substantiate the claimant's statements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Consideration of other evidence.</E> Since symptoms sometimes suggest a greater severity of impairment than can be shown by objective medical evidence alone, the Board will carefully consider any other information the claimant may submit about his or her symptoms. The information that the claimant, the claimant's treating or examining physician or psychologist, or other persons provide about the claimant's pain or other symptoms (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> what may precipitate or aggravate the claimant's symptoms, what medications, treatments or other methods he or she uses to alleviate them, and how the symptoms may affect the claimant's pattern of daily living) is also an important indicator of the intensity and persistence of the claimant's symptoms. Because symptoms, such as pain, are subjective and difficult to quantify, any symptom-related functional limitations and restrictions which the claimant, his or her treating or examining physician or psychologist, or other persons report, which can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence, will be taken into account as explained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section in reaching a conclusion as to whether the claimant is disabled. The Board will consider all of the evidence presented, including information about the claimant's prior work record, the claimant's statements about his or her symptoms, evidence submitted by the claimant's treating, examining or consulting physician or psychologist, and observations by Board employees and other persons. Section 220.112 of this part explains in detail how the Board considers and weighs treating source and other medical opinions about the nature and severity of the claimant's impairment(s) and any related symptoms, such as pain. Factors relevant to the claimant's symptoms, such as pain, which the Board will consider include:</P>
              <P>(i) The claimant's daily activities;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location, duration, frequency, and intensity of the claimant's pain or other symptoms;</P>
              <P>(iii) Precipitating and aggravating factors;</P>
              <P>(iv) The type, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of any medication the claimant takes or has taken to alleviate the claimant's pain or other symptoms;</P>
              <P>(v) Treatment, other than medication, the claimant receives or has received for relief of pain or other symptoms;</P>

              <P>(vi) Any measures the claimant uses or has used to relieve pain or other symptoms (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> lying flat on the claimant's back, standing for 15 to 20 minutes every hour, sleeping on a board, etc.); and<PRTPAGE P="308"/>
              </P>
              <P>(vii) Other factors concerning the claimant's functional limitations and restrictions due to pain or other symptoms.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">How the Board determines the extent to which symptoms, such as pain, affect the claimant's capacity to perform basic work activities.</E> In determining the extent to which the claimant's symptoms, such as pain, affect the claimant's capacity to perform basic work activities, the Board considers all of the available evidence described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. The Board will consider the claimant's statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of the claimant's symptoms, and the Board will evaluate the claimant's statements in relation to the objective medical evidence and other evidence, in reaching a conclusion as to whether the claimant is disabled. The Board will consider whether there are any inconsistencies in the evidence and the extent to which there are any conflicts between the claimant's statements and the rest of the evidence, including the claimant's medical history, the medical signs and laboratory findings, and statements by the claimant's treating or examining physician or psychologist or other persons about how the claimant's symptoms affect the claimant. The claimant's symptoms, including pain, will be determined to diminish the claimant's capacity for basic work activities to the extent that the claimant's alleged functional limitations and restrictions due to symptoms, such as pain, can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Consideration of symptoms in the disability determination process.</E> The Board follows a set order of steps to determine whether the claimant is disabled. If the claimant is not doing substantial gainful activity, the Board considers the claimant's symptoms, such as pain, to evaluate whether the claimant has a severe physical or mental impairment(s), and at each of the remaining steps in the process. Section 220.100 explains this process in detail. The Board also considers the claimant's symptoms, such as pain, at the appropriate steps in the Board's review when the Board considers whether the claimant's disability continues. Subpart O of this part explains the procedure the Board follows in reviewing whether the claimant's disability continues.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Need to establish a severe medically determinable impairment(s).</E> The claimant's symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness, or nervousness, are considered in making a determination as to whether the claimant's impairment or combination of impairment(s) is severe. (<E T="03">See</E> § 220.100(b)(2) of this part).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Decision of whether impairment(s) is medically disabling.</E> The Board will not substitute the claimant's allegations of pain or other symptoms for a missing or deficient sign or laboratory finding to raise the severity of the claimant's impairment(s) to that of being medically disabling. If the symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings of the claimant's impairment(s) are found by the Board to be so severe as to prevent any substantial gainful activity, the Board will find the claimant disabled. If it does not, the Board will consider the impact of the claimant's symptoms on the claimant's residual functional capacity. (<E T="03">See</E> paragraph (d)(3) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Impact of symptoms (including pain) on residual functional capacity.</E> If the claimant has a medically determinable severe physical or mental impairment(s), but the claimant's impairment(s) is not medically disabling, the Board will consider the impact of the claimant's impairment(s) and any related symptoms, including pain, on the claimant's residual functional capacity.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The claimant's impairment(s), and any related symptoms, such as pain, may cause physical and mental limitations that affect what the claimant can do in a work setting. The claimant's residual functional capacity is what the claimant can still do despite the claimant's limitations. If the claimant has more than one impairment, the Board will consider all of the claimant's impairment(s) of which the Board is aware. The Board will consider the claimant's ability to meet certain demands of jobs, such as physical demands, mental demands, sensory requirements, and other functions, as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Residual functional capacity is an assessment based upon all of the relevant evidence. It may include descriptions (even the claimant's own) of limitations that go beyond the symptoms, such as pain, that are important in the diagnosis and treatment of the claimant's medical condition. Observations by the claimant's treating or examining physicians or psychologists, the claimant's family, neighbors, friends, or other persons, of the claimant's limitations, in addition to those observations usually made during formal medical examinations, may also be used. These descriptions and observations, when used, must be considered along with the claimant's medical records to enable us to decide to what extent the claimant's impairment(s) keeps the claimant from performing particular work activities. This assessment of the claimant's remaining capacity for work is not a decision on whether the claimant is disabled, but is used as the basis for determining the particular types of work the claimant may be able to do despite the claimant's impairment(s). Then, using the guidelines in §§ 220.125 and 220.134 of this part the claimant's vocational background is considered along with the claimant's residual functional capacity in arriving at a disability determination or decision. In deciding whether the claimant's disability continues or ends, the residual functional capacity assessment may also be used to determine whether any medical improvement the claimant has experienced is related to the claimant's ability to work as discussed in § 220.178 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Physical abilities.</E> When the Board assesses the claimant's physical abilities, the Board first assesses the nature and extent of the claimant's physical limitations and then determines the claimant's residual functional capacity for work activity on a regular and continuing basis. A limited ability to perform certain physical demands of work activity, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or other physical functions (including manipulative or postural functions, such as reaching, handling, stooping or crouching), may reduce the claimant's ability to do past work and other work.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mental abilities.</E> When the Board assesses the claimant's mental abilities, the Board first assesses the nature and extent of the claimant's mental limitations and restrictions and then determines the claimant's residual functional capacity for work activity <PRTPAGE P="310"/>on a regular and continuing basis. A limited ability to carry out certain mental activities, such as limitations in understanding, remembering, and carrying out instructions, and in responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers, and work pressures in a work setting, may reduce the claimant's ability to do past work and other work.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other abilities affected by impairment(s).</E> Some medically determinable impairment(s), such as skin impairment(s), epilepsy, impairment(s) of vision, hearing or other senses, and impairment(s) which impose environmental restrictions, may cause limitations and restrictions which affect other work-related abilities. If the claimant has this type of impairment(s), the Board considers any resulting limitations and restrictions which may reduce the claimant's ability to do past work and other work in deciding the claimant's residual functional capacity.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Total limiting effects.</E> When the claimant has a severe impairment(s), but the claimant's symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings are not medically disabling, the Board will consider the limiting effects of all of the claimant's impairment(s), even those that are not severe, in determining the claimant's residual functional capacity. Pain or other symptoms may cause a limitation of function beyond that which can be determined on the basis of the anatomical, physiological or psychological abnormalities considered alone; e.g., someone with a low back disorder may be fully capable of the physical demands consistent with those of sustained medium work activity, but another person with the same disorder, because of pain, may not be capable of more than the physical demands consistent with those of light work activity on a sustained basis. In assessing the total limiting effects of the claimant's impairment(s) and any related symptoms, the Board will consider all of the medical and non-medical evidence, including the information described in § 220.114 of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) For cases at the initial or reconsideration level, the responsibility for determining residual functional capacity rests with the bureau of retirement claims. This assessment is based on all the evidence the Board has, including any statements regarding what the claimant can still do that have been provided by treating or examining physicians, consultative physicians, or any other physician designated by the Board. In any case where there is evidence which indicates the existence of a mental impairment, the bureau of retirement claims will not make a residual functional capacity determination without making every reasonable effort to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist has provided a medical review of the case.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board will consider vocational factors when the claimant is applying for—</P>
              <P>(1) An employee annuity based on disability for any regular employment; (See § 220.45(b))</P>
              <P>(2) Widow(er) disability annuity; or</P>

              <P>(1) The Board will use information from the claimant about his or her age, education, and work experience.</P>

              <P>(2) The Board will consider the doctors' reports, and hospital records, as well as the claimant's own statements and other evidence to determine a claimant's residual functional capacity <PRTPAGE P="311"/>and how it affects the work the claimant can do. Sometimes, to do this, the Board will need to ask the claimant to have special examinations or tests. (See § 220.50.)</P>
              <P>(3) If the Board finds that the claimant can no longer do the work he or she has done in the past, the Board will determine whether the claimant can do other work (jobs) which exist in significant numbers in the national economy.</P>

To determine whether the claimant can do other work, the Board will consider the claimant's residual functional capacity, and his or her age, education, and work experience. Any work (jobs) that the claimant can do must exist in significant numbers in the national economy (either in the region where he or she lives or in several regions of the country).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Arduous work.</E> Arduous work is primarily physical work requiring a high level of strength or endurance. The Board will consider the claimant unable to do lighter work and therefore, disabled if he or she has—</P>
              <P>(1) A marginal education (see § 220.129);</P>
              <P>(2) Work experience of 35 years or more during which he or she did arduous unskilled physical labor; and</P>

              <P>(2) Evidence shows that the claimant has training or past work experience which enables him or her to do substantial gainful activity in another occupation with his or her impairment, either full-time or on reasonably regular part-time basis.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>B is a 60-year-old miner with a 4th grade education who has a life-long history of arduous physical labor. B says that he is disabled because of arthritis of the spine, hips, and knees, and other impairments. Medical evidence shows a combination of impairments and establishes that these impairments prevent B from performing his usual work or any other type of arduous physical labor. His vocational background does not show that he has skills or capabilities needed to do lighter work which would be readily transferable to another work setting. Under these circumstances, the Board will find that B is disabled.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Age as a vocational factor.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) <E T="03">Age</E> refers to how old the claimaint is (chronological age) and the extent to which his or her age affects his or her ability to—</P>
              <P>(i) Adapt to a new work situation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Do work in competition with others.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining disability, the Board does not consider age alone. The Board must also consider the claimant's residual functional capacity, education, and work experience. If the claimant is unemployed because of his or her age and can still do a significant number of jobs which exist in the national economy, the Board will find that he or she is not disabled. Appendix 2 of this part explains in detail how the Board considers age as a vocational factor. However, the Board does not apply these age categories mechanically in a borderline situation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Younger person.</E> If the claimant is under age 50, the Board generally does not consider that his or her age will seriously affect the ability to adapt to a new work situation. In some circumstances, the Board considers age 45 a handicap in adapting to a new work setting (see Rule 201.17 in appendix 2 of this part).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Person approaching advanced age.</E> If the claimant is closely approaching advanced age (50-54), the Board considers that the claimant's age, along <PRTPAGE P="312"/>with a severe impairment and limited work experience, may seriously affect the claimant's ability to adjust to a significant number of jobs in the national economy.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Person of advanced age.</E> The Board considers that advanced age (55 or over) is the point at which age significantly affects the claimant's ability to do substantial gainful activity.</P>
              <P>(1) If the claimant is severly impaired and of advanced age, and he or she cannot do medium work (see § 220.132), the claimant may not be able to work unless he or she has skills that can be used in less demanding jobs which exist in significant numbers in the national economy.</P>
              <P>(2) If the claimant is close to retirement age (60-64) and has a severe impairment, the Board will not consider him or her able to adjust to sedentary or light work unless the claimant has skills which are highly marketable.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 220.129</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Education as a vocational factor.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> “Education” is primarily used to mean formal schooling or other training which contributes to the claimant's ability to meet vocational requirements, for example, reasoning ability, communication skills, and arithmetical ability. If the claimant does not have formal schooling, this does not necessarily mean that the claimant is uneducated or lacks these abilities. Past work experience and the kinds of responsibilities the claimant had when he or she was working may show that he or she has intellectual abilities, although the claimant may have little formal education. A claimant's daily activities, hobbies, or the results of testing may also show that the claimant has significant intellectual ability that can be used to work.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How the Board evaluates the claimant's education.</E> The importance of the claimant's educational background may depend upon how much time has passed between the completion of the claimant's formal education and the beginning of the claimant's physical or mental impairment(s) and what the claimant has done with his or her education in a work or other setting. Formal education completed many years before the claimant's impairment(s) began, or unused skills and knowledge that were a part of the claimant's formal education, may no longer be useful or meaningful in terms of ability to work. Therefore, the numerical grade level that the claimant completed in school may not represent his or her actual educational abilities. These educational abilities may be higher or lower than the numerical grade level that the claimant completed. However, if there is no other evidence to contradict it, the Board uses the claimant's numerical grade level to determine the claimant's educational abilities. The term “education” also includes how well the claimant is able to communicate in English since this ability is often acquired or improved by education. In evaluating the claimant's educational level, the Board uses the following categories:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Illiteracy.</E> Illiteracy means the inability to read or write. The Board will consider the claimant illiterate if he or she cannot read or write a simple message such as instructions or inventory lists even though the claimant can sign his or her name. Generally, the illiterate claimant has had little or no formal schooling.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Marginal education.</E> Marginal education means ability in reasoning, arithmetic, and language skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types of jobs. Generally, this means a 6th grade or less level of education.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited education.</E> Limited education means ability in reasoning, arithmetic, and language skills, but not enough to allow a person with these educational qualifications to do most of the more complex duties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs. Generally, a limited education is a 7th grade through 11th grade level of education.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">High school education and above.</E> High school and above means abilities in reasoning, arithmetic, and language skills acquired through formal schooling at a 12th grade level or above. The claimant with this level of education is generally considered able to do semi-skilled through skilled work.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Inability to communicate in English.</E> Since the ability to speak, read, and understand English is generally learned or increased at school, the <PRTPAGE P="313"/>Board may consider this an educational factor. Because English is the dominant language of the country, it may be difficult for the claimant who does not speak and understand English to do a job, regardless of the amount of education he or she may have in another language. The claimant's ability to speak, read and understand English will be considered when the Board evaluates what work, if any, he or she can do.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Information about the claimant's education.</E> The Board will ask the claimant how long he or she attended school and whether he or she can speak, understand, read and write in English, and do at least simple calculations in arithmetic. The Board will also consider information about how much formal or informal education the claimant received from his or her previous work, community projects, hobbies and any other activities which might help him or her to work.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Work experience as a vocational factor.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E>
                <E T="03">Work experience</E> means skills and abilities the claimant has acquired through work he or she has done which show the type of work he or she may be expected to do. Work the claimant has already been able to do shows the kind of work that he or she may be expected to do. The Board considers that the claimant's work experience is relevant and applies when it was done within the last 15 years, lasted long enough for him or her to learn to do it, and was substantial gainful activity. This work experience is called “past relevant work.” The Board does not usually consider that work the claimant did 15 years or more before the time the Board is deciding whether he or she is disabled (or when the disability insured status requirement was last met, if earlier) applies. A gradual change occurs in most jobs so that after 15 years, it is no longer realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired in a job done then continue to apply. The 15-year guide is intended to insure that remote work experience is not currently applied. If the claimant has no work experience or worked only “off-and-on” or for brief periods of time during the 15-year period, the Board generally considers that these do not apply. If the claimant has acquired skills through his or her past work, the Board considers the claimant to have these work skills unless he or she cannot use them in other skilled or semi-skilled work that he or she can do. If the claimant cannot use his or her skills in other skilled or semi-skilled work, the Board will consider his or her work background the same as unskilled. However, even if the claimant has no work experience, the Board may consider that the claimant is able to do unskilled work because it requires little or no judgment and can be learned in a short period of time.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Information about the claimant's work.</E> (1) Sometimes the Board will need information about the claimant's past work to make a disability determination. The Board may request work information from—</P>
              <P>(i) The claimant; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The claimant's employer or other person who knows about the claimant's work (member of family or co-worker) with the claimant's permission.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board will ask for the following information about all the jobs the claimant has had in the last 15 years:</P>
              <P>(i) The dates the claimant worked.</P>
              <P>(ii) All the duties the claimant did.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any tools, machinery, and equipment the claimant used.</P>
              <P>(iv) The amount of walking, standing, sitting, lifting and carrying the claimant did during the work day, as well as any other physical and mental duties of the job.</P>
              <P>(3) If all the claimant's work in the past 15 years has been arduous and unskilled, and the claimant has very little education, the Board will ask the claimant to tell about all of his or her work from the time he or she first began working. (See § 220.45(b).)</P>

              <SUBJECT>Work which exists in the national economy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board considers that work exists in the national economy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region where the claimant lives or in several other regions of the country. It does not matter whether—</P>

              <P>(1) Work exits in the immediate area in which the claimant lives,<PRTPAGE P="314"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A specific job vacancy exists for the claimant; or</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant would be hired if the claimant applied for work.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How the Board determines the existence of work.</E> Work exists in the national economy when there are a significant number of jobs (in one or more occupations) having requirements which the claimant is able to meet with his or her physical or mental ability and vocational qualifications. Isolated jobs that exist in very limited numbers in relatively few locations outside the region where the claimant lives are not considered “work which exists in the national economy.” The Board will not deny the claimant a disability annuity on the basis of the existence of these kinds of jobs. The Board will determine that the claimant is disabled if the work he or she can do does not exist in the national economy. If the work the claimant can do does exist in the national economy, the Board will determine that the claimant is not disabled.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Inability to obtain work.</E> The Board will determine that the claimant is not disabled if he or she has the residual functional capacity and vocational abilities to do work which exists in the national economy but the claimant remains unemployed because of—</P>
              <P>(1) His or her inability to get work;</P>
              <P>(2) Lack of work in his or her local area;</P>

              <P>(6) No job openings for the claimant;</P>
              <P>(7) The claimant not actually being hired to do work he or she could otherwise do; or</P>
              <P>(8) The claimant not wishing to do a particular type of work.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Physical exertion requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>To determine the physical exertion requirements of work in the national economy, jobs are classified as “sedentary”, “light”, “medium”, “heavy”, and “very heavy.” These terms have the same meaning as they have in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, published by the Department of Labor. In making disability determinations the Board uses the following definitions:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Sedentary work.</E> Sedentary work involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and the other sedentary criteria are met.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Light work.</E> Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, the claimant must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities. If the claimant can do light work, the Board determines that he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there <PRTPAGE P="315"/>are additional limiting factors such as loss of fine dexerity or inability to sit for long periods of time.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Medium work.</E> Medium work involves lifting no more than 50 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 25 pounds. If the claimant can do medium work, the Board determines that he or she can also do sedentary and light work.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Heavy work.</E> Heavy work involves lifting no more than 100 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If the claimant can do heavy work, the Board determines that he or she can also do medium, light, and sedentary work.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Very heavy work.</E> Very heavy work involves lifting objects weighing more than 100 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing 50 pounds or more. If the claimant can do very heavy work, the Board determines that he or she can also do heavy, medium, light and sedentary work.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> To evaluate skills and to help determine the existence in the national economy of work the claimant is able to do, occupations are classified as unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled. In classifying these occupations, the Board uses materials published by the Department of Labor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Unskilled work.</E> Unskilled work is work which needs little or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time (30 days). The job may or may not require considerable strength. A job is considered unskilled if the claimant can usually learn to do the job in 30 days, and little job training and judgment are needed. The claimant does not gain work skills by doing unskilled jobs. For example, jobs are considered unskilled if primary work duties are—</P>
              <P>(1) Handling;</P>
              <P>(2) Feeding;</P>
              <P>(3) Offbearing (placing or removing materials from machines which are automatic or operated by others); or</P>
              <P>(4) Machine tending.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Semi-skilled work.</E> Semi-skilled work is work which needs some skills but does not require doing the more complex work duties. A job may be classified as semi-skilled where coordination and dexterity are necessary, as when hand or feet must be moved quickly to do repetitive tasks. Semi-skilled jobs may require—</P>
              <P>(1) Alertness and close attention to watching machine processes;</P>
              <P>(2) Inspecting, testing, or otherwise looking for irregularities;</P>
              <P>(3) Tending or guarding equipment, property, materials, or persons against loss, damage, or injury; or</P>
              <P>(4) Other types of activities which are similarly less complex than skilled work but more complex than unskilled work.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Skilled work.</E> Skilled work requires qualifications in which a person uses judgment to determine the machine and manual operations to be performed in order to obtain the proper form, quality, or quantity of material to be produced. Skilled jobs may require—</P>
              <P>(1) Laying out work;</P>
              <P>(2) Estimating quality;</P>
              <P>(3) Determining suitability and needed quantities of materials;</P>
              <P>(4) Making precise measurements;</P>
              <P>(5) Reading blueprints or other specifications;</P>
              <P>(6) Making necessary computations or mechanical adjustments to control or regulate work; or</P>
              <P>(7) Dealing with people, facts, figures or abstract ideas at a high level of complexity.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Skills that can be used in other work (transferability)</E>—(1) <E T="03">What the Board means by transferable skills.</E> The Board considers the claimant to have skills that can be used in other jobs, when the skilled or semi-skilled work activities the claimant did in past work can be used to meet the requirements of skilled or semi-skilled work activities of other jobs or kinds of work. This depends largely on the similarity of occupationally significant work activities among different jobs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">How the Board determines skills that can be transferred to other jobs.</E> Transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in which—</P>
              <P>(i) The same or a lesser degree of skill is required;</P>

              <P>(ii) The same or similar tools and machines are used; and<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The same or similar raw materials, products, processes, or services are involved.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Degrees of transferability.</E> There are degrees of transferability of skills ranging from very close similarities to remote and incidental similarities among jobs. A complete similarity of all three factors is not necessary for transferability. However, when skills are so specialized or have been acquired in such an isolated vocational setting (like many jobs in mining, agriculture, or fishing) that they are not readily usable in other industries, jobs, and work settings, they are considered not transferable.</P>

              <P>(a) The Dictionary of Occupational Titles includes information about jobs (classified by their exertional and skill requirements) that exist in the national economy. Appendix 2 of this part provides rules using this data reflecting major functional and vocational patterns.</P>

              <P>(c) The rules in appendix 2 of this part do not cover all possible variations of factors. The Board does not apply these rules if one of the findings of fact about the claimant's vocational factors and residual functional capacity is not the same as the corresponding criterion of a rule. In these instances, the Board gives full consideration to all relevant facts in accordance with the definitions and discussions under vocational considerations. However, if the findings of fact made about all factors are the same as the rule, the Board uses that rule to decide whether that claimant is disabled.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exertional and nonexertional limitations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, may cause limitations of function or restrictions which limit the claimant's ability to meet certain demands of jobs. These limitations may be exertional, nonexertional, or a combination of both. Limitations are classified as exertional if they affect the claimant's ability to meet the strength demands of jobs. The classification of a limitation as exertional is related to the United States Department of Labor's classification of jobs by various exertional levels (sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy) in terms of the strength demands for sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling. Sections 220.132 and 220.134 of this part explain how the Board uses the classification of jobs by exertional levels (strength demands) which is contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles published by the Department of Labor, to determine the exertional requirements of work which exists in the national economy. Limitations or restrictions which affect the claimant's ability to meet the demands of jobs other than the strength demands, that is, demands other than sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling, are considered nonexertional. Sections 220.100(b)(5) and 220.180(h) of this part explain that if the claimant can no longer do the claimant's past relevant work because of a severe medically determinable impairment(s), the Board must determine whether the claimant's impairment(s), when considered along with the claimant's age, education, and work experience, prevents the claimant from doing any other work which exists in the national economy in order to decide whether the claimant is disabled or continues to be disabled. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section explain how the Board applies the medical-vocational guidelines in appendix 2 of this part in making this determination, depending on whether the limitations or restrictions imposed by the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, are exertional, nonexertional, or a combination of both.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exertional limitations.</E> When the limitations and restrictions imposed by the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, affect only the claimant's ability to meet the strength demands of jobs (sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, <PRTPAGE P="317"/>pushing, and pulling), the Board considers that the claimant has only exertional limitations. When the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms only impose exertional limitations and the claimant's specific vocational profile is listed in a rule contained in appendix 2 of this part, the Board will directly apply that rule to decide whether the claimant is disabled.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonexertional limitations.</E> (1) When the limitations and restrictions imposed by the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, affect only the claimant's ability to meet the demands of jobs other than the strength demands, the Board considers that the claimant has only nonexertional limitations or restrictions. Some examples of nonexertional limitations or restrictions include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Difficulty functioning because the claimant is nervous, anxious, or depressed;</P>
              <P>(ii) Difficulty maintaining attention or concentration;</P>
              <P>(iii) Difficulty understanding or remembering detailed instructions;</P>
              <P>(iv) Difficulty in seeing or hearing;</P>

              <P>(v) Difficulty tolerating some physical feature(s) of certain work settings, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the claimant cannot tolerate dust or fumes; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Difficulty performing the manipulative or postural functions of some work such as reaching, handling, stooping, climbing, crawling, or crouching.</P>
              <P>(2) If the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, only affect the claimant's ability to perform the nonexertional aspects of work-related activities, the rules in appendix 2 do not direct factual conclusions of disabled or not disabled. The determination as to whether disability exists will be based on the principles in the appropriate sections of the regulations, giving consideration to the rules for specific case situations in appendix 2 of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Combined exertional and nonexertional limitations.</E> When the limitations and restrictions imposed by the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, affect the claimant's ability to meet both the strength and demands of jobs other than the strength demands, the Board considers that the claimant has a combination of exertional and nonexertional limitations or restrictions. If the claimant's impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, affect the claimant's ability to meet both the strength and demands of jobs other than the strength demands, the Board will not directly apply the rules in appendix 2 unless there is a rule that directs a conclusion that the claimant is disabled based upon the claimant's strength limitations; otherwise the rules provide a framework to guide the Board's decision.</P>

              <P>The work that a claimant has done during any period in which the claimant believes he or she is disabled may show that the claimant is able to do work at the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is able to engage in substantial gainful activity, the Board will find that the claimant is not disabled for any regular employment under the Railroad Retirement Act. Even if the work the claimant has done was not substantial gainful activity, it may show that the claimant is able to do more work than he or she actually did. The Board will consider all of the medical and vocational evidence in the claimant's file to decide whether or not the claimant has the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</P>

              <P>Substantial gainful activity is work activity that is both substantial and gainful.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Substantial work activity.</E> Substantial work activity is work activity that involves doing significant physical or mental activities. The claimant's work may be substantial even if it is done on a part-time basis or if the claimant does less, gets paid less, or has less responsibility than when the claimant worked before.<PRTPAGE P="318"/>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Gainful work activity.</E> Gainful work activity is work activity that the claimant does for pay or profit. Work activity is gainful if it is the kind of work usually done for pay or profit, whether or not a profit is realized.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Some other activities.</E> Generally, the Board does not consider activities like taking care of one's self, household tasks, hobbies, therapy, school attendance, club activities, or social programs to be substantial gainful activity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General information about work activity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The nature of the claimant's work.</E> If the claimant's duties require use of the claimant's experience, skills, supervision and responsibilities, or contribute substantially to the operation of a business, this tends to show that the claimant has the ability to work at the substantial gainful activity level.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How well the claimant performs.</E> The Board considers how well the claimant does his or her work when the Board determines whether or not the claimant is doing substantial gainful activity. If the claimant does his or her work satisfactorily, this may show that the claimant is working at the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is unable, because of his or her impairments, to do ordinary or simple tasks satisfactorily without more supervision or assistance than is usually given other people doing similar work, this may show that the claimant is not working at the substantial gainful activity level. If the claimant is doing work that involves minimal duties that make little or no demands on the claimant and that are of little or no use to the claimant's railroad or non-railroad employer, or to the operation of a business if the claimant is self-employed, this does not show that the claimant is working at the substantial gainful activity level.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">If the claimant's work is done under special conditions.</E> Even though the work the claimant is doing takes into account his or her impairment, such as work done in a sheltered workshop or as a patient in a hospital, it may still show that the claimant has the necessary skills and ability to work at the substantial gainful activity level.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">If the claimant is self-employed.</E> Supervisory, managerial, advisory or other significant personal services that the claimant performs as a self-employed person may show that the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Time spent in work.</E> While the time the claimant spends in work is important, the Board will not decide whether or not the claimant is doing substantial gainful activity only on that basis. The Board will still evaluate the work to decide whether it is substantial and gainful regardless of whether the claimant spends more time or less time at the job than workers who are not impaired and who are doing similar work as a regular means of their livelihood.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 220.143</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Evaluation guides for an employed claimant.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board uses several guides to decide whether the work the claimant has done shows that he or she is able to do substantial gainful activity.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">The claimant's earnings may show the claimant has done substantial gainful activity.</E> The amount of the claimant's earnings from work the claimant has done may show that he or she has engaged in substantial gainful activity. Generally, if the claimant worked for substantial earnings, this will show that he or she is able to do substantial gainful activity. On the other hand, the fact that the claimant's earnings are not substantial will not necessarily show that the claimant is not able to do substantial gainful activity. The Board will generally consider work that the claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her impairment(s) as an unsuccessful work attempt and the claimant's earnings from that work will not show that the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The Board considers only the amount the claimant earns.</E> The Board does not consider any income not directly related to the claimant's productivity when the Board decides whether the claimant has done substantial <PRTPAGE P="319"/>gainful activity. If the claimant's earnings are subsidized, the amount of the subsidy is not counted when the Board determines whether or not the claimant's work is substantial gainful activity. Thus, where work is done under special conditions, the Board only considers the part of the claimant's pay which the claimant actually “earns.” For example, where a handicapped person does simple tasks under close and continuous supervision, the Board would not determine that the person worked at the substantial gainful activity level only on the basis of the amount of pay. A railroad or non-railroad employer may set a specific amount as a subsidy after figuring the reasonable value of the employee's services. If the claimant's work is subsidized and the claimant's railroad and non-railroad employer does not set the amount of the subsidy or does not adequately explain how the subsidy was figured, the Board will investigate to see how much the claimant's work is worth.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">If the claimant is working in a sheltered or special environment.</E> If the claimant is working in a sheltered workshop, the claimant may or may not be earning the amounts he or she is being paid. The fact that the sheltered workshop or similar facility is operating at a loss or is receiving some charitable contributions or governmental aid does not establish that the claimant is not earning all he or she is being paid. Since persons in military service being treated for a severe impairment usually continue to receive full pay, the Board evaluates work activity in a therapy program or while on limited duty by comparing it with similar work in the civilian work force or on the basis of reasonable worth of the work, rather than on the actual amount of the earnings.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Earnings guidelines</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> If the claimant is employed, the Board first considers the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and § 220.145, and then the guides in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Earnings that will ordinarily show that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity.</E> The Board will consider that the earnings from the employed claimant (including earnings from sheltered work, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section) show that the claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity if:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Before January 1, 2001</E>, the earnings averaged more than the amount(s) in Table 1 of this section for the time(s) in which the claimant worked.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Beginning January 1, 2001</E>, the earnings are more than an amount determined for each calendar year to be the larger of:</P>
              <P>(A) The amount for the previous year, or</P>
              <P>(B) The amount established by the Social Security Administration to constitute substantial gainful activity for such year.</P>

Average monthly earnings from a sheltered workshop or a comparable facility that are equal to or less than those indicated in Table 1 of this section will ordinarily show that the claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity without the need to consider the other information, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, regardless of whether they are more or less than those indicated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. When the claimant's earnings from a sheltered workshop or comparable facility are equal to or less than those amounts indicated in Table 1 of this section, the Board will consider the provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section only if there is evidence that the claimant may have done substantial gainful activity. For work performed in a sheltered workshop or comparable facility beginning January 1, 2001, the rules of paragraph (b)(2), (3), and (6) apply the same as they do to any other work done by an employee.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">If there is evidence showing that the claimant may have done substantial gainful activity.</E> If there is evidence showing that the claimant may have done substantial gainful activity, the Board will apply the criteria in paragraph (b)(6) of this section regarding comparability and value of services.</P>

This rule generally applies to employees who did not work in a sheltered workshop or a comparable facility, although the Board may apply it to some people who work in sheltered workshops or comparable facilities (see paragraph (b)(4) of this section).</P>
              <P>(ii) Beginning January 1, 2001, if the claimant's average monthly earnings are equal to or less than the amounts determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Board will generally not consider other information in addition to the claimant's earnings unless there is evidence indicating that the claimant may be engaging in substantial gainful activity or that the claimant is in a position to defer or suppress his or her earnings.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation guides for a self-employed claimant.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">If the claimant is a self-employed claimant.</E> The Board will consider the claimant's activities and their value to the claimant's business to decide whether the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity if the claimant is self-employed. The Board will not consider the claimant's income alone since the amount of income the claimant actually receives may depend upon a number of different factors like capital investment, profit sharing agreements, etc. The Board will generally consider work that the claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her impairment(s) as an unsuccessful work attempt and the claimant's income from that work will not show that the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity. The Board will evaluate the claimant's work activity on the value to the business of the claimant's services regardless of whether the claimant receives an immediate income for his or her services. The Board considers that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity if—</P>
              <P>(1) The claimant's work activity, in terms of factors such as hours, skills, energy output, efficency, duties, and responsibilities, is comparable to that of unimpaired persons in the claimant's community who are in the same or similar businesses as their means of livelihood;</P>
              <P>(2) The claimant's work activity, although not comparable to that of unimpaired persons, is clearly worth the amount shown in § 220.143(b)(2) when considered in terms of its value to the business, or when compared to the salary that an owner would pay to an employed person to do the work the claimant is doing; or</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant renders services that are significant to the operation of the business and receives a substantial income from the business.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What the Board means by significant services</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claimants who are not farm landlords.</E> If the claimant is not a farm landlord and the claimant operates a business entirely by himself or herself, any services that the claimant renders are significant to the business. If the claimant's business involves the services of more than one person, the Board will consider the claimant to be rendering significant services if he or she contributes more than half the total time required for the management of the business or he or she renders management services for more than 45 hours a month regardless of the total management time required by the business.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Claimants who are farm landlords</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> If the claimant is a farm landlord, that is, the claimant rents farm land to another, the Board will consider the claimant to be rendering significant services if the claimant materially participates in the production or the management of the production of the things raised on the rented farm. If the claimant was given social security earnings credits because he or she materially participated in the activities of the farm and he or she continues these same activities, the Board will consider the claimant to be rendering significant services.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Material participation.</E> (A) The claimant will have established that he or she is materially participating if he or she—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Furnishes a large portion of the machinery, tools, and livestock used in the production of the things raised on the rented farm; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Furnishes or advances monies or assumes financial responsibility for a substantial part of the expense involved in the production of the things raised on the rented farm.</P>
              <P>(B) The claimant will have presented strong evidence that he or she is materially participating if he or she periodically—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Advise or consults with the other person who under the rental agreement produces the things raised on the rented farm; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Inspects the production activities on the land.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Production.</E> The term “production” refers to the physical work performed and the expenses incurred in producing the things raised on the <PRTPAGE P="322"/>farm. It includes activities like the actual work of planting, cultivating, and harvesting of crops, and the furnishing of machinery, implements, seed, and livestock.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Management of the production.</E> The term “management of the production” refers to services performed in making managerial decisions about the production of the crop, such as when to plant, cultivate, dust, spray or harvest. It includes advising and consulting, making inspections, and making decisions on matters, such as rotation of crops, the type of crops to be grown, the type of livestock to be raised, and the type of machinery and implements to be furnished.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What the Board means by substantial income.</E> After the claimant's normal business expenses are deducted from the claimant's gross income to determine net income, the Board will deduct the reasonable value of any unpaid help, any soil bank payments that were included as farm income, and impairment-related work expenses described in § 220.145 that have not been deducted in determining the claimant's net earnings from self-employment. The Board will consider the resulting amount of income from the business to be substantial if—</P>
              <P>(1) It averages more than the amounts described in § 220.143(b)(2); or</P>
              <P>(2) It averages less than the amounts described in § 220.143(b)(2) but the livelihood which the claimant gets from the business is either comparable to what it was before the claimant became severely impaired or is comparable to that of unimpaired self-employed persons in the claimant's community who are in the same or similar businesses as their means of livelihood.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 220.145</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Impairment-related work expenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When the Board figures the claimant's earnings in deciding if the claimant has done substantial gainful activity, the Board will subtract the reasonable costs to the claimant of certain items and services which, because of his or her impairment(s), the claimant needs and uses to enable him or her to work. The costs are deductible even though the claimant also needs or uses the items and services to carry out daily living functions unrelated to his or her work. Paragraph (b) of this section explains the conditions for deducting work expenses. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the expenses the Board will deduct. Paragraph (d) of this section explains when expenses may be deducted. Paragraph (e) of this section describes how expenses may be allocated. Paragraph (f) of this section explains the limitations on deducting expenses. Paragraph (g) of this section explains the Board's verification procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conditions for deducting impairment-related work expenses.</E> The Board will deduct impairment-related work expenses if—</P>
              <P>(1) The claimant is otherwise disabled as defined in § 220.26;</P>
              <P>(2) The severity of the claimant's impairment(s) requires the claimant to purchase (or rent) certain items and services in order to work;</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant pays the cost of the item or service. No deduction will be allowed to the extent that payment has been or will be made by another source. No deduction will be allowed to the extent that the claimant has been, could be, or will be reimbursed for such cost by any other source (such as through a private insurance plan, Medicare or Medicaid, or other plan or agency). For example, if the claimant purchases crutches for $80 but the claimant was, could be, or will be reimbursed $64 by some agency, plan, or program, the Board will deduct only $16;</P>
              <P>(4) The claimant pays for the item or service in a month he or she is working (in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section); and</P>
              <P>(5) The claimant's payment is in cash (including checks or other forms of money). Payment in kind is not deductible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">What expenses may be deducted</E>—(1) <E T="03">Payments for attendant care services.</E> (i) If because of the claimant's impairment(s) the claimant needs assistance in traveling to and from work, or while at work the claimant needs assistance with personal functions (e.g., eating, toileting) or with work-related functions (e.g., reading, communicating), the payments the claimant makes for those services may be deducted.<PRTPAGE P="323"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If because of the claimant's impairment(s) the claimant needs assistance with personal functions (e.g., dressing, administering medications) at home in preparation for going to and assistance in returning from work, the payments the claimant makes for those services may be deducted.</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) The Board will deduct payments the claimant makes to a family member for attendant care services only if such person, in order to perform the services, suffers an economic loss by terminating his or her employment or by reducing the number of hours he or she worked.</P>
              <P>(B) The Board considers a family member to be anyone who is related to the claimant by blood, marriage or adoption, whether or not that person lives with the claimant.</P>
              <P>(iv) If only part of the claimant's payment to a person is for services that come under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Board will only deduct that part of the payment which is attributable to those services. For example, an attendant gets the claimant ready for work and helps the claimant in returning from work, which takes about 2 hours a day. The rest of the attendant's 8-hour day is spent cleaning the claimant's house and doing the claimant's laundry, etc. The Board would only deduct one-fourth of the attendant's daily wages as an impairment-related work expense.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment for medical devices.</E> If the claimant's impairment(s) requires that the claimant utilize medical devices in order to work, the payments the claimant makes for those devices may be deducted. As used in this subparagraph, medical devices include durable medical equipment which can withstand repeated use, is customarily used for medical purposes, and is generally not useful to a person in the absence of an illness or injury. Examples of durable medical equipment are wheelchairs, hemodialysis equipment, canes, crutches, inhalators and pacemakers.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payments for prosthetic devices.</E> If the claimant's impairment(s) requires that the claimant utilize a prosthetic device in order to work, the payments the claimant makes for that device can be deducted. A prosthetic device is that which replaces an internal body organ or external body part. Examples of prosthetic devices are artificial replacements of arms, legs and other parts of the body.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Payments for equipment</E>—(i) <E T="03">Work-related equipment.</E> If the claimant's impairment(s) requires that the claimant utilize special equipment in order to do his or her job, the payments the claimant makes for that equipment may be deducted. Examples of work-related equipment are one-hand typewriters, vision aids, sensory aids for the blind, telecommunication devices for the deaf and tools specifically designed to accommodate a person's impairment(s).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Residential modifications.</E> If the claimant's impairment(s) requires that the claimant make modifications to his or her residence, the location of the claimant's place of work will determine if the cost of these modifications will be deducted. If the claimant is employed away from home, only the cost of changes made outside of the claimant's home to permit the claimant to get to his or her means of transportation (e.g., the installation of an exterior ramp for a wheelchair confined person or special exterior railings or pathways for someone who requires crutches) will be deducted. Costs relating to modifications of the inside of the claimant's home will not be deducted. If the claimant works at home, the costs of modifying the inside of the claimant's home in order to create a working space to accommodate the claimant's impairment(s) will be deducted to the extent that the changes pertain specifically to the space in which the claimant works. Examples of such changes are the enlargement of a doorway leading into the workspace or modification of the workspace to accommodate problems in dexterity. However, if the claimant is self-employed at home, any cost deducted as a business expense cannot be deducted as an impairment-related work expense.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-medical appliances and equipment.</E> Expenses for appliances and equipment which the claimant does not ordinarily use for medical purposes are generally not deductible. Examples of these items are portable room heaters, air conditioners, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and electric air cleaners. <PRTPAGE P="324"/>However, expenses for such items may be deductible when unusual circumstances clearly establish an impairment-related and medically verified need for such an item because it is for the control of the claimant's disabling impairment(s), thus enabling the claimant to work. To be considered essential, the item must be of such a nature that if it were not available to the claimant there would be an immediate adverse impact on the claimant's ability to function in his or her work activity. In this situation, the expense is deductible whether the item is used at home or in the working place. An example would be the need for an electric air cleaner by a person with severe respiratory disease who cannot function in a non-purified air environment. An item such as an exercycle is not deductible if used for general physical fitness. If an exercycle is prescribed and used as necessary treatment to enable the claimant to work, the Board will deduct payments the claimant makes toward its cost.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Payments for drugs and medical services.</E> (i) If the claimant must use drugs or medical services (including diagnostic procedures) to control his or her impairment(s), the payments the claimant makes for them may be deducted. The drugs or services must be prescribed (or utilized) to reduce or eliminate symptoms of the claimant's impairment(s) or to slow down its progression. The diagnostic procedures must be performed to ascertain how the impairment(s) is progressing or to determine what type of treatment should be provided for the impairment(s).</P>
              <P>(ii) Examples of deductible drugs and medical services are anti-convulsant drugs to control epilepsy or anticonvulsant blood level monitoring; antidepressant medication for mental impairments; medication used to allay the side effects of certain treatments; radiation treatment or chemotherapy for cancer patients; corrective surgery for spinal impairments; electroencephalograms and brain scans related to a disabling epileptic impairment; tests to determine the efficacy of medication on a diabetic condition; and immunosuppressive medications that kidney transplant patients regularly take to protect against graft rejection.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Board will only deduct the costs of drugs or services that are directly related to the claimant's impairment(s). Examples of non-deductible items are routine annual physical examinations, optician services (unrelated to a disabling visual impairment) and dental examinations.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Payments for similar items and services</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> If the claimant is required to utilize items and services not specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section, but which are directly related to his or her impairment(s) and which the claimant needs to work, their costs are deductible. Examples of such items and services are medical supplies and services not discussed above, the purchase and maintenance of a dog guide which the claimant needs to work, and transportation.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Medical supplies and services not described above.</E> The Board will deduct payments the claimant makes for expendable medical supplies, such as incontinence pads, catheters, bandages, elastic stockings, face masks, irrigating kits, and disposable sheets and bags. The Board will also deduct payments the claimant makes for physical therapy which the claimant requires because of his or her impairment(s) and which the claimant needs in order to work.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Payments for transportation costs.</E> The Board will deduct transportation costs in these situations:</P>
              <P>(A) The claimant's impairment(s) requires that in order to get to work the claimant needs a vehicle that has structural or operational modifications. The modifications must be critical to the claimant's operation or use of the vehicle and directly related to the claimant's impairment(s). The Board will deduct the cost of the modifications, but not the cost of the vehicle. The Board will also deduct a mileage allowance for the trip to and from work. The allowance will be based on data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration relating to vehicle operating costs.</P>

              <P>(B) The claimant's impairment(s) requires the claimant to use driver assistance, taxicabs or other hired vehicles in order to work. The Board will <PRTPAGE P="325"/>deduct amounts paid to the driver and, if the claimant's own vehicle is used, the Board will also deduct a mileage allowance, as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, for the trip to and from work.</P>
              <P>(C) The claimant's impairment(s) prevents the claimant from taking available public transportation to and from work and the claimant must drive his or her (unmodified) vehicle to work. If the Board can verify through the claimant's physician or other sources that the need to drive is caused by the claimant's impairment(s) (and not due to the unavailability of public transportation), the Board will deduct a mileage allowance, as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, for the trip to and from work.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Payments for installing, maintaining, and repairing deductible items.</E> If the device, equipment, appliance, etc., that the claimant utilizes qualifies as a deductible item as described in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), (4) and (6) of this section, the costs directly related to installing, maintaining and repairing these items are also deductible. (The costs which are associated with modifications to a vehicle are deductible. Except for a mileage allowance, as provided for in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, the costs which are associated with the vehicle itself are not deductible.)</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">When expenses may be deducted</E>—(1) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> To be deductible, an expense must be incurred after November 30, 1980. An expense may be considered incurred after that date if it is paid thereafter even though pursuant to a contract or other arrangement entered into before December 1, 1980.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payments for services.</E> A payment the claimant makes for services may be deducted if the services are received while the claimant is working and the payment is made in a month the claimant is working. The Board considers the claimant to be working even though he or she must leave work temporarily to receive the services.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payments for items.</E> A payment the claimant makes toward the cost of a deductible item (regardless of when it is acquired) may be deducted if payment is made in a month claimant is working. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section when purchases are made in anticipation of work.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">How expenses are allocated</E>—(1) <E T="03">Recurring expenses.</E> The claimant may pay for services on a regular periodic basis, or the claimant may purchase an item on credit and pay for it in regular periodic installments or the claimant may rent an item. If so, each payment the claimant makes for the services and each payment the claimant makes toward the purchase or rental (including interest) is deductible in the month it is made.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>B starts work in October 1981 at which time she purchases a medical device at a cost of $4,800 plus interest charges of $720. Her monthly payments begin in October. She earns and receives $400 a month. The term of the installment contract is 48 months. No downpayment is made. The monthly allowable deduction for the item would be $115 ($5,520 divided by 48) for each month of work during the 48 months.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-recurring expenses.</E> Part or all of the claimant's expenses may not be recurring. For example, the claimant may make a one-time payment in full for an item or service or make a downpayment. If the claimant is working when he or she makes the payment, the Board will either deduct the entire amount in the month the claimant pays it or allocate the amount over a 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of payment, whichever the claimant selects.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>A begins working in October 1981 and earns $525 a month. In the same month, he purchases and pays for a deductible item at a cost of $250. In this situation the Board could allow a $250 deduction for October 1981, reducing A's earnings below the substantial gainful activity level for that month.</P>
                <P>If A's earnings had been $15 above the substantial gainful activity earnings amount, A probably would select the option of projecting the $250 payment over the 12-month period, October 1981-September 1982, giving A an allowable deduction of $20.83 a month for each month of work during that period. This deduction would reduce A's earnings below the substantial gainful activity level for 12 months.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Allocating downpayments.</E> If the claimant makes a downpayment, the Board will, if the claimant chooses, make a separate calculation for the downpayment in order to provide for uniform monthly deductions. In these <PRTPAGE P="326"/>situations the Board will determine the total payment that the claimant will make over a 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the downpayment and allocate that amount over the 12 months. Beginning with the 13th month, the regular monthly payment will be deductible. This allocation process will be for a shorter period if the claimant's regular monthly payments will extend over a period of less than 12 months.
              </P>

The balance of $3,600, plus interest of $540, is to be repaid in 36 installments of $115 a month beginning November 1981. C earns $500 a month. He chooses to have the downpayment allocated. In this situation the Board would allow a deduction of $205.42 a month for each month of work during the period October 1981 through September 1982. After September 1982, the deduction amount would be the regular monthly payment of $115 for each month of work during the remaining installment period.</P>

D chooses to have the downpayment allocated. In this situation, the Board would allow a deduction of $225 a month for each month of work during the period July 1981 through June 1982. After June 1982, the deduction amount would be the regular monthly payment of $125 for each month of work.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Payments made in anticipation of work.</E> A payment made toward the cost of a deductible item that the claimant made in any of the 11 months preceding the month he or she started working will be taken into account in determining the claimant's impairment-related work expenses. When an item is paid for in full during the 11 months preceding the month the claiment started working, the payment will be allocated over the 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the payment. However, the only portion of the payment which may be deductible is the portion allocated to the month work begins and the following months. For example, if an item is purchased 3 months before the month work began and is paid for with a one-time payment of $600, the deductible amount would be $450 ($600 divided by 12, multiplied by 9). Installment payments (including a downpayment) that the claimant made for a particular item during the 11 months preceding the month he or she started working will be totalled and considered to have been made in the month of the claimant's first payment for that item within this 11-month period. The sum of these payments will be allocated over the 12-consecutive-month period beginning with the month of the claimant's first payment (but never earlier than 11 months before the month work began). However, the only portion of the total which may be deductible is the portion allocated to the month work begins and the following months. For example, if an item is purchased 3 months before the month work began and is paid for in 3 monthly installments of $200 each, the total payment of $600 will be considered to have been made in the month of the first payment, that is, 3 months before the month work began. The deductible amount would be $450 ($600 divided by 12, multiplied by 9). The amount, as determined by these formulas, will then be considered to have been paid in the first month of work. The Board will deduct either this entire amount in the first month of work or allocate it over a 12-consecutive-month period, beginning with the first month of work, whichever the claimant selects. In the above examples, the claimant would have the choice of having the entire $450 deducted in the first month of work or having $37.50 a month ($450 divided by 12) deducted for each month that he or she works over a 12-consecutive-month period, beginning with the <PRTPAGE P="327"/>first month of work. To be deductible, the payments must be for durable items such as medical devices, prostheses, work-related equipment, residential modifications, non-medical appliances and vehicle modifications. Payments for services and expendable items such as drugs, oxygen, diagnostic procedures, medical supplies and vehicle operating costs are not deductible for the purpose of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Limits on deductions.</E> (1) The Board will deduct the actual amounts the claimant pays towards his or her impairment-related work expenses unless the amounts are unreasonable. With respect to durable medical equipment, prosthetic devices, medical services, and similar medically-related items and services, the Board will apply the prevailing charges under Medicare (Part B of the title XVIII, Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled) to the extent that this information is readily available. Where the Medicare guides are used, the Board will consider the amount that the claimant pays to be reasonable if it is no more than the prevailing charge for the same item or service under the Medicare guidelines. If the amount the claimant actually pays is more than the prevailing charge for the same item under the Medicare guidelines, the Board will deduct from the claimant's earnings the amount the claimant paid to the extent he or she establishes that the amount is consistent with the standard or normal charge for the same or similar item or service in his or her community. For items and services that are not listed in the Medicare guidelines, and for items and services that are listed in the Medicare guidelines but for which such guides cannot be used because the information is not readily available, the Board will consider the amount the claimant pays to be reasonable if it does not exceed the standard or normal charge for the same or similar item or service in the claimant's community.</P>
              <P>(2) Impairment-related work expenses are not deducted in computing the claimant's earnings for purposes of determining whether the claimant's work was “services” as described in § 220.170.</P>
              <P>(3) The decision as to whether the claimant performed substantial gainful activity in a case involving impairment-related work expenses for items or services necessary for the claimant to work generally will be based upon the claimant's “earnings” and not on the value of “services” the claimant rendered. (See §§ 220.143 (b)(6)(i) and (ii), and 220.144(a)). This is not necessarily so, however, if the claimant is in a position to control or manipulate his or her earnings.</P>
              <P>(4) No deduction will be allowed to the extent that any other source has paid or will pay for an item or service. No deduction will be allowed to the extent that the claimant has been, could be, or will be reimbursed for payments he or she made. (See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(5) The provisions described in the foregoing paragraphs in this section are effective with respect to expenses incurred on or after December 1, 1980, although expenses incurred after November 1980, as a result of contractual or other arrangements entered into before December 1980, are deductible. For months before December 1980, the Board will deduct impairment-related work expenses from the claimant's earnings only to the extent they exceeded the normal work-related expenses the claimant would have had if the claimant did not have his or her impairment(s). The Board will not deduct expenses, however, for those things with the claimant needed even when he or she was not working.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Verification.</E> The Board will verify the claimant's need for items or services for which deductions are claimed, and the amount of the charges for those items or services. The claimant will also be asked to provide proof that he or she paid for the items or services.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Earnings report.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Any annuitant receiving an annuity based on disability must report to the Board any work and earnings as described in §§ 220.160 and 220.161. The report may be a written or oral statement by the annuitant, or a person acting for the annuitant, made or sent to a representative of the Board.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Earnings are less than $5000.</E> If the employee's yearly earnings are less than $5000, all annuity payments and penalties withheld during the year because of earnings over $4800 are paid.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Earnings are $5000 or more.</E> (1) If the employee's yearly earnings are $5000 or more, the annuity payments are adjusted so that the employee does not have more than one regular deduction for every $400 of earnings over $4800. The last $200 or more of earnings over $4800 is treated as if it were $400. If the annuity rate changes during the year, any annuities due at the end of the year are paid first for months in which the annuity rate is higher.

If it is the employee's first failure to report, the penalty deduction is equal to one month's annuity. If it is the employee's second or later failure to report, the penalty deduction equals the annuity amount for each month in which the employee earned over $400 and failed to report it on time.</P>

                <P>Employee is awarded a disability annuity based upon his inability to engage in his regular railroad occupation effective January 1, 1989. During that year, he works April through October, for which he receives $785 per month. He does not report these earnings to the Board until January of the following year. The employee is considered to have earned $5600 (7 × $785 = $5495, <PRTPAGE P="329"/>which is rounded up to the nearest $400). He forfeits three months of annuities:</P>

              <SUBJECT>The trial work period.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition of the trial work period.</E> The trial work period is a period during which the annuitant may test his or her ability to work and still be considered disabled. The trial work period begins and ends as described in paragraph (e) of this section. During this period, the annuitant may perform “services” (see paragraph (b) of this section) in as many as 9 months, but these months do not have to be consecutive. The Board will not consider those services as showing that the annuitant's disability has ended until the annuitant has performed services in at least 9 months. However, after the trial work period has ended, the Board will consider the work the annuitant did during the trial work period in determining whether the annuitant's disability has ended at any time after the trial work period.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">What the Board means by services.</E> When used in this section, services means any activity (whether legal or illegal), even though it is not substantial gainful activity, which is done in employment or self-employment for pay or profit, or is the kind normally done for pay or profit. We generally do not consider work done without remuneration to be services if it is done merely as therapy or training, or if it is work usually done in a daily routine around the house, or in self-care.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">If the claimant is an employee.</E> The Board will consider the claimant's work as an employee to be services if:</P>
              <P>(i) Before January 1, 2002, the claimant's earnings in a month were more than the amount(s) indicated in Table 1 of this section for the year(s) in which the claimant worked.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Beginning January 1, 2002</E>, the claimant's earnings in a month are more than an amount determined for each calendar year to be the larger of:</P>
              <P>(A) Such amount for the previous year, or</P>
              <P>(B) The amount established by the Social Security Administration for such year as constituting the amount of monthly earnings used to determine whether a person has performed services for counting trial work period months.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">If the claimant is self-employed.</E> The Board will consider the claimant's activities as a self-employed person to be services if:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Before January 1, 2002</E>, the claimant's net earnings in a month were more than the amount(s) indicated in Table 2 of this section for the year(s) in which the claimant worked, or the hours the claimant worked in the business in a month are more than the number of hours per month indicated in Table 2 for the years in which the claimant worked.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Beginning January 1, 2002</E>, the claimant worked more than 80 hours a month in the business, or the claimant's net earnings in a month are more than an amount determined for each calendar year to be the larger of:</P>
              <P>(A) Such amount for the previous year, or</P>
              <P>(B) The amount established by the Social Security Administration for such year as constituting the amount of monthly earnings used to determine whether a person has performed services for counting trial work period months.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When disability continues or ends.</SUBJECT>
              <P>There is a statutory requirement that, if an annuitant is entitled to a disability annuity, the annuitant's continued entitlement to such an annuity must be reviewed periodically until the employee or child annuitant reaches full retirement age and the widow(er) annuitant reaches age 60. When the annuitant is entitled to a disability annuity as a disabled employee, disabled widow(er) or as a person disabled since childhood, there are a number of factors to be considered in deciding whether his or her disability continues. The Board must first consider whether the annuitant has worked and, by doing so, demonstrated the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. If so, the disability will end. If the annuitant has not demonstrated the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, then the Board must determine if there has been any medical improvement in the annuitant's impairment(s) and, if so, whether this medical improvement is related to the annuitant's ability to work. If an impairment(s) has not medically improved, the Board must consider whether one or more of the exceptions to medical improvement applies. If medical improvement related to ability to work has not occurred and no exception applies, the disability will continue. Even the medical improvement related to ability to work has occurred or an exception applies (see § 220.179 for exceptions), in most cases the Board must also show that the annuitant is currently able to engage in substantial gainful activity before it can find that the annuitant is no longer disabled.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Terms and definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>There are several terms and definitions which are important to know in order to understand how the Board reviews whether a disability for any regular employment continues:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Medical improvement.</E> Medical improvement is any decrease in the medical severity of an impairment(s) which was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision that <PRTPAGE P="332"/>the annuitant was disabled or continued to be disabled. A determination that there has been a decrease in medical severity must be based on a comparison of prior and current medical evidence showing changes (improvement) in the symptoms, signs or laboratory findings associated with the impairment(s).
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>The claimant was awarded a disability annuity due to a herniated disc. At the time of the Board's prior decision granting the claimant an annuity he had had a laminectomy.</P>
                <P>Postoperatively, a myelogram still shows evidence of a persistant deficit in his lumbar spine. He had pain in his back, and pain and a burning sensation in his right foot and leg. There were no muscle weakness or neurological changes and a modest decrease in motion in his back and leg. When the Board reviewed the annuitant's claim to determine whether his disability should be continued, his treating physician reported that he had seen the annuitant regularly every 2 to 3 months for the past 2 years. No further myelograms had been done, complaints of pain in the back and right leg continued especially on sitting or standing for more than a short period of time. The annuitant's doctor further reported a moderately decreased range of motion in the annuitant's back and right leg, but again no muscle atrophy or neurological changes were reported. Medical improvement has not occurred because there has been no decrease in the severity of the annuitant's back impairment as shown by changes in symptoms, signs or laboratory findings.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
                <P>The claimant was awarded a disability annuity due to rheumatoid arthritis. At the time, laboratory findings were positive for this impairment. The claimant's doctor reported persistent swelling and tenderness of the claimant's fingers and wrists and that he complained of joint pain. Current medical evidence shows that while laboratory tests are still positive for rheumatoid arthritis, the annuitant's impairment has responded favorably to therapy so that for the last year his fingers and wrists have not been significantly swollen or painful. Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decrease in the severity of the annuitant's impairment as documented by the current symptoms and signs reported by his physician. Although the annuitant's impairment is subject to temporary remission and exacerbations, the improvement that has occurred has been sustained long enough to permit a finding of medical improvement. The Board would then determine if this medical improvement is related to the annuitant's ability to work.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical improvement not related to ability to do work.</E> Medical improvement is not related to the annuitant's ability to work if there has been a decrease in the severity of the impairment(s) (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision, but no increase in that annuitant's functional capacity to do basic work activities as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. If there has been any medical improvement in an annuitant's impairment(s), but it is not related to the annuitant's ability to do work and none of the exceptions applies, the annuity will be continued.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>An annuitant was 65 inches tall and weighed 246 pounds at the time his disability was established. He had venous insufficiency and persistent edema in his legs. At the time, the annuitant's ability to do basic work activities was affected because he was able to sit for 6 hours, but was able to stand or walk only occasionally. At the time of the Board's continuing disability review, the annuitant had undergone a vein stripping operation. He now weighed 220 pounds and had intermittent edema. He is still able to sit for 6 hours at a time and to stand or walk only occasionally although he reports less discomfort on walking. Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decrease in the severity of the existing impairment as shown by his weight loss and the improvement in his edema. This medical improvement is not related to his ability to work, however, because his functional capacity to do basic work activities (i.e., the ability to sit, stand and walk) has not increased.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical improvement that is related to ability to do work.</E> Medical improvement is related to an annuitant's ability to work if there has been a decrease in the severity (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) of the impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision and an increase in the annuitant's functional capacity to do basic work activities as discussed in paragraph (d) of this section. A determination that medical improvement related to an annuitant's ability to do work has occurred does not, necessarily, mean that such annuitant's disability will be found to have ended unless it is also shown that the annuitant is currently able to engage in substantial gainful activity as discussed in paragraph (e) of this section.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <PRTPAGE P="333"/>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant has a back impairment and has had a laminectomy to relieve the nerve root impingement and weakness in his left leg. At the time of the Board's prior decision, basic work activities were affected because he was able to stand less than 6 hours, and sit no more than <FR>1/2</FR> hour at a time. The annuitant had a successful fusion operation on his back about 1 year before the Board's review of his entitlement. At the time of the Board's review, the weakness in his leg has decreased. The annuitant's functional capacity to perform basic work activities now is unimpaired because he now has no limitation on his ability to sit, walk, or stand. Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decrease in the severity of his impairment as demonstrated by the decreased weakness in his leg. This medical improvement is related to his ability to work because there has also been an increase in his functional capacity to perform basic work activities (or residual functional capacity) as shown by the absence of limitation on his ability to sit, walk, or stand. Whether or not his disability is found to have ended, however, will depend on the Board's determination as to whether he can currently engage in substantial gainful activity.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant was injured in an automobile accident receiving a compound fracture to his right femur and a fractured pelvis. When he applied for disability annuity 10 months after the accident his doctor reported that neither fracture had yet achieved solid union based on his clinical examination. X-rays supported this finding. The annuitant's doctor estimated that solid union and a subsequent return to full weight bearing would not occur for at least 3 more months. At the time of the Board's review 6 months later, solid union had occurred and the annuitant had been returned to full weight-bearing for over a month. His doctor reported this and the fact that his prior fractures no longer placed any limitation on his ability to walk, stand, and lift, and, that in fact, he could return to full-time work if he so desired.</P>
                <P>Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decrease in the severity of the annuitant's impairments as shown by x-ray and clinical evidence of solid union and his return to full weight-bearing. This medical improvement is related to his ability to work because these findings no longer support an impairment of the severity of the impairment on which the finding that he was medically disabled was based (see § 220.178(c)(1)). Whether or not the annuitant's disability is found to have ended will depend on the Board's determination as to whether he can currently engage in substantial gainful activity.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Functional capacity to do basic work activities.</E> (1) Under the law, disability is defined, in part, as the inability to do any regular employment by reason of a physical or mental impairment(s). “Regular employment” is defined in this part as “substantial gainful activity.” In determining whether the annuitant is disabled under the law, the Board will measure, therefore, how and to what extent the annuitant's impairment(s) has affected his or her ability to do work. The Board does this by looking at how the annuitant's functional capacity for doing basic work activities has been affected. Basic work activities means the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs. Included are exertional abilities such as walking, standing, pushing, pulling, reaching and carrying, and non-exertional abilities and aptitudes such as seeing, hearing, speaking, remembering, using judgment, dealing with changes in a work setting and dealing with both supervisors and fellow workers. The annuitant who has no impairment(s) would be able to do all basic work activities at normal levels; he or she would have an unlimited functional capacity to do basic work activities. Depending on its nature and severity, an impairment(s) will result in some limitation to the functional capacity to do one or more of these basic work activities. Diabetes, for example, can result in circulatory problems which could limit the length of time the annuitant could stand or walk and can result in damage to his or her eyes as well, so that the annuitant also had limited vision. What the annuitant can still do, despite his or her impairment(s), is called his or her residual functional capacity. How the residual functional capacity is assessed is discussed in more detail in § 220.120. Unless an impairment is so severe that it is deemed to prevent the annuitant from doing substantial gainful activity (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the impairment(s) is medically disabling), it is this residual functional capacity that is used to determine whether the annuitant can still do his or her past work or, in conjunction with his or her age, education and work experience, do any other work.</P>

              <P>(2) A decrease in the severity of an impairment as measured by changes <PRTPAGE P="334"/>(improvement) in symptoms, signs or laboratory findings can, if great enough, result in an increase in the functional capacity to do work activities. Vascular surgery (e.g., femoropopliteal bypass) may sometimes reduce the severity of the circulatory complications of diabetes so that better circulation results and the annuitant can stand or walk for longer periods. When new evidence showing a change in medical findings establishes that both medical improvement has occurred and the annuitant's functional capacity to perform basic work activities, or residual functional capacity, has increased, the Board will find that medical improvement which is related to the annuitant's ability to do work has occurred. A residual functional capacity assessment is also used to determine whether an annuitant can engage in substantial gainful activity and, thus, whether he or she continues to be disabled (see paragraph (e) of this section).</P>
              <P>(3) Many impairment-related factors must be considered in assessing an annuitant's functional capacity for basic work activities. Age is one key factor. Medical literature shows that there is a gradual decrease in organ function with age; that major losses and deficits become irreversible over time and that maximum exercise performance diminishes with age. Other changes related to sustained periods of inactivity and the aging process include muscle atrophy, degenerative joint changes, decrease in range of motion, and changes in the cardiac and respiratory systems which limit the exertional range.</P>
              <P>(4) Studies have also shown that the longer the annuitant is away from the workplace and is inactive, the more difficult it becomes to return to ongoing gainful employment. In addition, a gradual change occurs in most jobs so that after about 15 years, it is no longer realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired in these jobs will continue to apply to the current workplace. Thus, if the annuitant is age 50 or over and had been receiving a disability annuity for a considerable period of time, the Board will consider this factor along with his or her age in assessing the residual functional capacity. This will ensure that the disadvantages resulting from inactivity and the aging process during a longer period of disability will be considered. In some instances where available evidence does not resolve what the annuitant can or cannot do on a sustained basis, the Board may provide special work evaluations or other appropriate testing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</E> In most instances, the Board must show that the annuitant is able to engage in substantial gainful activity before stopping his or her annuity. When doing this, the Board will consider all of the annuitant's current impairments not just that impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent favorable determination. If the Board cannot determine that the annuitant is still disabled based on medical considerations alone (as discussed in §§ 220.110 through 220.115), it will use the new symptoms, signs and laboratory findings to make an objective assessment of functional capacity to do basic work activities (or residual functional capacity) and will consider vocational factors. See §§ 220.120 through 220.134.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Evidence and basis for the Board's decision.</E> The Board's decisions under this section will be made on a neutral basis without any initial inference as to the presence or absence of disability being drawn from the fact that the annuitant had previously been determined to be disabled. The Board will consider all of the evidence the annuitant submits. An annuitant must give the Board reports from his or her physician, psychologist, or others who have treated or evaluated him or her, as well as any other evidence that will help the board determine if he or she is still disabled (see § 220.45). The annuitant must have a good reason for not giving the Board this information or the Board may find that his or her disability has ended (see § 220.178(b)(2)). If the Board asks the annuitant, he or she must contact his or her medical sources to help the Board get the medical reports. The Board will make every reasonable effort to help the annuitant in getting medical reports when he or she gives the Board permission to request them from his or her <PRTPAGE P="335"/>physician, psychologist, or other medical sources, Every reasonable effort means that the Board will make an initial request and, after 20 days, one follow-up request to the annuitant's medical source to obtain the medical evidence necessary to make a determination before the Board evaluates medical evidence obtained from another source on a consultative basis. The medical source will have 10 days from the follow-up to reply (unless experience indicates that a longer period is advisable in a particular case). In some instances the Board may order a consultative examination while awaiting receipt of medical source evidence. Before deciding that an annuitant's disability has ended, the Board will develop a complete medical history covering at least the preceding 12 months (See § 220.45(b)). A consultative examination may be purchased when the Board needs additional evidence to determine whether or not an annuitant's disability continues. As a result, the Board may ask the annuitant, upon the Board request and reasonable notice, to undergo consultative examinations and tests to help the Board determine whether the annuitant is still disabled (see § 220.50). The Board will decide whether or not to purchase a consultative examination in accordance with the standards in §§ 220.53 through 220.54.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Point of comparison.</E> For purposes of determining whether medical improvement has occurred, the Board will compare the current medical severity of that impairment(s), which was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision that the annuitant was disabled or continued to be disabled, to the medical severity of that impairment(s) at that time. If medical improvement has occurred, the Board will compare the annuitant's current functional capacity to do basic work activities (i.e., his or her residual functional capacity) based on this previously existing impairment(s) with the annuitant's prior residual functional capacity in order to determine whether the medical improvement is related to his or her ability to do work. The most recent favorable medical decision is the latest decision involving a consideration of the medical evidence and the issue of whether the annuitant was disabled or continued to be disabled which became final.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determining medical improvement and its relationship to the annuitant's ability to do work.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 220.177 discuss what is meant by medical improvement, medical improvement not related to the ability to work and medical improvement that is related to the ability to work. How the Board will arrive at the decision that medical improvement has occurred and its relationship to the ability to do work, is discussed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining if medical improvement is related to ability to work.</E> If there is a decrease in medical severity as shown by the symptoms, signs and laboratory findings, the Board then must determine if it is related to the annuitant's ability to do work. In § 220.177(d) the relationship between medical severity and limitation on functional capacity to do basic work activities (or residual functional capacity) and how changes in medical severity can affect the annuitant's residual functional capacity is explained. In determining whether medical improvement that has occurred is related to the annuitant's ability to do work, the Board will assess the annuitant's residual functional capacity (in accordance with § 220.177(d)) based on the current severity of the impairment(s) which was present at that annuitant's last favorable medical decision. The annuitant's new residual functional capacity will then be compared to the annuitant's residual functional capcity at the time of the Board's most recent favorable medical decision. Unless an increase in the current residual functional capacity is based on changes in the signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings, any medical improvement that has occurred will not be considered to be related to the annuitant's ability to do work.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional factors and considerations.</E> The Board will also apply the following in its determinations of medical improvement and its relationship to the annuitant's ability to do work:<PRTPAGE P="336"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Previous impairment was medically disabling.</E> If the Board's most recent favorable decision was based on the fact that the annuitant's impairment(s) at that time was medically disabling, an assessment of his or her residual functional capacity would not have been made. If medical improvement has occurred and the current severity of the prior impairment(s) is no longer medically disabling based on the standard (<E T="03">see</E> § 220.100(b)(3)) applied at the time of that decision, the Board will find that the medical improvement was related to the annuitant's ability to work. If the medical findings support impairment(s) that is currently so severe as to be medically disabling, the annuitant is deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. If there has been medical improvement to the degree that the impairment(s) is not currently medically disabling, then there has been medical improvement related to the annuitant's ability to work. The Board must, of course, also establish that the annuitant can currently engage in gainful activity before finding that his or her disability has ended.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prior residual functional capacity assessment made.</E> The residual functional capacity assessment used in making the most recent favorable medical decision will be compared to the residual functional capacity assessment based on current evidence in order to determine if an annuitant's functional capacity for basic work activities has increased. There will be no attempt made to reassess the prior residual functional capacity.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Prior residual functional capacity assessment should have been made, but was not.</E> If the most recent favorable medical decision should have contained an assessment of the annuitant's residual functional capacity (i.e., his or her impairment(s) was not medically disabling) but does not, either because this assessment is missing from the annuitant's file or because it was not done, the Board will reconstruct the residual functional capacity. This reconstructed residual functional capacity will accurately and objectively assess the annuitant's functional capacity to do basic work activities. The Board will assign the maximum functional capacity consistent with an allowance.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant was previously found to be disabled on the basis that while his impairment was not medically disabling, it did prevent him from doing his past or any other work. The prior adjudicator did not, however, include a residual functional capacity assessment in the rationale of that decision and a review of the prior evidence does not show that such an assessment was ever made. If a decrease in medical severity, i.e., medical improvement, has occurred, the residual functional capacity based on the current level of severity of the annuitant's impairment will have to be compared with his residual functional capacity based on its prior severity in order to determine if the medical improvement is related to his ability to do work. In order to make this comparison, the Board will review the prior evidence and make an objective assessment of the annuitant's residual functional capacity at the time of its most recent favorable medical determination, based on the symptoms, signs and laboratory findings as they then existed.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Impairment subject to temporary remission.</E> In some cases the evidence shows that the annuitant's impairment(s) are subject to temporary remission. In assessing whether medical improvement has occurred in annuitants with this type of impairment(s), the Board will be careful to consider the longitudinal history of the impairment(s), including the occurrence of prior remission, and prospects for future worsenings. Improvement in such impairment(s) that is only temporary, i.e., less than 1 year, will not warrant a finding of medical improvement.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Prior file cannot be located.</E> If the prior file cannot be located, the Board will first determine whether the annuitant is able to now engage in substantial gainful activity based on all of his or her current impairments. (In this way, the Board will be able to determine that his or her disability continues at the earliest point without addressing the often lengthy process of reconstructing prior evidence.)

              <SUBJECT>Exceptions to medical improvement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">First group of exceptions to medical improvement.</E> The law provides for certain limited situations when the annuitant's disability can be found to have ended even though medical improvement has not occurred, if he or she can engage in substantial gainful activity. These exceptions to medical improvement are intended to provide a way of finding that the annuitant is no longer disabled in those limited situations where, even though there has been no decrease in severity of the impairment(s), evidence shows that the annuitant should no longer be considered disabled or never should have been considered disabled. If one of these exceptions applies, the Board must also show that, taking all of the annuitant's current impairment(s) into account, not just those that existed at the time of the Board's most recent favorable medical decision, the annuitant is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity before his or her disability can be found to have ended. As part of the review process, the annuitant will be asked about any medical or vocational therapy that he or she has received or is receiving. Those answers and the evidence gathered as a result as well as all other evidence, will serve as the basis for the finding that an exception applies.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Substantial evidence shows that the annuitant is the beneficiary of advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to his or her ability to work).</E> Advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology are improvements in treatment or rehabilitative methods which have increased the annuitant's ability to do basic work activities. The Board will apply this exception when substantial evidence shows that the annuitant has been the beneficiary of services which reflect these advances and they have favorably affected the severity of his or her impairment(s) or ability to do basic work activities. This decision will be based on new medical evidence and a new residual functional capacity assessment. In many instances, an advanced medical therapy or technology will result in a decrease in severity as shown by symptoms, signs and laboratory findings which will meet the definition of medical improvement. This exception will, therefore, see very limited application.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Substantial evidence shows that the annuitant has undergone vocational therapy (related to his or her ability to work).</E> Vocational therapy (related to the annuitant's ability to work) may include, but is not limited to, additional education, training, or work experience that improves his or her ability to meet the vocational requirements of more jobs. This decision will be based on substantial evidence which includes new medical evidence and a new residual functional capacity assessment. If, at the time of the Board's review the annuitant has not completed vocational therapy which could affect the continuance of his or her disability, the Board will review such annuitant's claim upon completion of the therapy.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant was found to be disabled because the limitations imposed on him by his impairment(s) allowed him to only do work that was at a sedentary level of exertion. The annuitant's prior work experience was work that required a medium level of exertion with no acquired skills that could be transferred to sedentary work. His age, education, and past work experience at the time did not qualify him for work that was below this medium level of exertion. The annuitant enrolled in and completed a specialized training course which qualifies him for a job in data processing as a computer programmer in the period since he was awarded a disability annuity. On review of his claim, current evidence shows that there is no medical improvement and that he can still do only sedentary work. As the work of a computer programmer is sedentary in nature, he is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity when his new skills are considered.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>

                <P>The annuitant was previously entitled to a disability annuity because the medical evidence and assessment of his residual functional capacity showed he could only do light work. His prior work was considered to be of a heavy exertional level with no acquired skills that could be transferred to light work. His age, education, and past work experience did not qualify him for work that was below the heavy level of exertion. The current evidence and residual functional capacity show there has been no medical improvement and that he can still do only light work. Since he was originally entitled to a disability annuity, his vocational rehabilitation agency enrolled him in and he successfully completed a trade school course so that <PRTPAGE P="338"/>he is now qualified to do small appliance repair. This work is light in nature, so when his new skills are considered, he is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity even though there has been no change in his residual functional capacity.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Substantial evidence shows that based on new or improved diagnostic or evaluative techniques the annuitant's impairment(s) is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent favorable decision.</E> Changing methodologies and advances in medical and other diagnostic or evaluative techniques have given, and will continue to give, rise to improved methods for measuring and documenting the effect of various impairments on the ability to do work. Where, by such new or improved methods, substantial evidence shows that the annuitant's impairment(s) is not as severe as was determined at the time of the Board's most recent favorable medical decision, such evidence may serve as a basis for finding that the annuitant can engage in substantial gainful activity and is no longer disabled. In order to be used under this exception, however, the new or improved techniques must have become generally available after the date of the Board's most recent favorable medical decision.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">How the Board will determine which methods are new or improved techniques and when they become generally available.</E> New or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations will come to the Board's attention by several methods. In reviewing cases, the Board often becomes aware of new techniques when their results are presented as evidence. Such techniques and evaluations are also discussed and acknowledged in medical literature by medical professional groups and other governmental entities. Through these sources, the Board develops listings of new techniques and when they become generally available.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">How the annuitant will know which methods are new or improved techniques and when they become generally available.</E> The Board will let annuitants know which methods it considers to be new or improved techniques and when they become available.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>The electrocardiographic exercise test has replaced the Master's 2-step test as a measurement of heart function since the time of the annuitant's last favorable medical decision. Current evidence shows that the annuitant's impairment, which was previously evaluated based on the Master's 2-step test, is not now as disabling as was previously thought. If, taking all his current impairments into account, the annuitant is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity, this exception would be used to find that he is no longer disabled even if medical improvement has not occurred.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Substantial evidence demonstrates that any prior disability decision was in error.</E> The Board will apply the exception to medical improvement based on error if substantial evidence (which may be evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the entitlement to an annuity based on disability was made, or newly obtained evidence which relates to that determination) demonstrates that a prior determination was in error. A prior determination will be found in error only if:</P>

              <P>(i) Substantial evidence shows on its face that the decision in question should not have been made (e.g., the evidence in file such as pulmonary function study values was misread or an adjudicative standard such as a medical/vocational rule in appendix 2 of this part was misapplied).
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant was granted a disability annuity when it was determined that his epilepsy met Listing 11.02. This listing calls for a finding of major motor seizures more frequently than once a month as documented by EEG evidence and by a detailed description of a typical seizure pattern. As history of either diurnal episodes or nocturnal episodes with residuals interfering with daily activities is also required. On review, it is found that a history of the frequency of his seizures showed that they occurred only once or twice a year. The prior decision would be found to be in error, and whether the annuitant was still considered to be disabled would be based on whether he could currently engage in substantial gainful activity.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>

                <P>The annuitant's prior award of a disability annuity was based on vocational rule 201.14 in appendix 2 of this part. This rule applies to a person age 50-54 who has at least a high school education, whose previous work was entirely at semiskilled level, and who can do only sedentary work. On review it is found that at the time of the prior determination the annuitant was actually only age 46 and vocational rule 201.21 should have been used. This rule would have called <PRTPAGE P="339"/>for a denial of his claim and the prior decision is found to have been in error. Continuation of his disability would depend on a finding of his current inability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(ii) At the time of the prior evaluation, required and material evidence of the severity of the annuitant's impairment(s) was missing. That evidence becomes available upon review, and substantial evidence demonstrates that had such evidence been present at the time of the prior determination, disability would not have been found.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant was found disabled on the basis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The severity of his impairment was documented primarily by pulmonary function testing results. The evidence showed that he could do only light work. Spirometric tracings of this testing, although required, were not obtained, however. On review, the original report is resubmitted by the consultative examining physician along with the corresponding spirometric tracings. A review of the tracings shows that the test was invalid. Current pulmonary function testing supported by spirometric tracings reveals that the annuitant's impairment does not limit his ability to perform basic work activities in any way. Error is found based on the fact that required material evidence, which was originally missing, now becomes available and shows that if it had been available at the time of the prior determination, disability would not have been found.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              

              <P>(iii) Substantial evidence which is new evidence relating to the prior determination (of allowance or continuance) refutes the conclusions that were based upon the prior evidence (e.g., a tumor thought to be malignant was later shown to have actually been benign). Substantial evidence must show that had the new evidence (which relates to the prior determination) been considered at the time of the prior decision, the disability would not have been allowed or continued. A substitution of current judgment for that used in the prior favorable decision will not be the basis for applying this exception.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>The annuitant was previously found entitled to a disability annuity on the basis of diabetes mellitus which the prior adjudicator believed was medically disabling. The prior record shows that the annuitant has “brittle” diabetes for which he was taking insulin. The annuitant's urine was 3 + for sugar, and he alleged occasional hypoglycemic attacks caused by exertion. His doctor felt the diabetes was never really controlled because he was not following his diet or taking his medication regularly. On review, symptoms, signs and laboratory findings are unchanged. The current adjudicator feels, however, that the annuitant's impairment clearly is not medically disabling. Error cannot be found because it would represent a substitution of current judgment for that of the prior adjudicator that the annuitant's impairment was medically disabling. The exception for error will not be applied retroactively under the conditions set out above unless the conditions for reopening the prior decision are met.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(5) <E T="03">The annuitant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity.</E> If the annuitant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity, before the Board determines whether he or she is no longer disabled because of his or her work activity, the Board will consider whether he or she is entitled to a trial work period as set out in § 220.170. The Board will find that the annuitant's disability has ended in the month in which he or she demonstrated the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity (following completion of a trial work period, where it applies). This exception does not apply in determining whether the annuitant continues to have a disabling impairment(s) for purposes of deciding his or her eligibility for a reentitlement period.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Second group of exceptions to medical improvement.</E> In addition to the first group of exceptions to medical improvement, the following exceptions may result in a determination that the annuitant is no longer disabled. In these situations the decision will be made without a determination that the annuitant has medically improved or can engage in substantial gainful activity.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">A prior determination was fraudulently obtained.</E> If the Board finds that any prior favorable determination was obtained by fraud, it may find that the annuitant is not disabled. In addition, the Board may reopen the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to cooperate with the Board.</E> If there is a question about whether the annuitant continues to be disabled and the Board requests that he or she submit medical or other evidence or go for a physical or mental examination by a certain date, the Board will find <PRTPAGE P="340"/>that the annuitant's disability has ended if he or she fails (without good cause) to do what is requested. The month in which the annuitant's disability ends will be the first month in which he or she failed to do what was requested.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inability of the Board to locate the annuitant.</E> If there is question about whether the annuitant continues to be disabled and the Board is unable to find him or her to resolve the question, the Board will suspend annuity payments. If, after a suitable investigation, the Board is still unable to locate the annuitant, the Board will determine that the annuitant's disability has ended. The month such annuitant's disability ends will be the first month in which the question arose and the annuitant could not be found.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure of the annuitant to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected to restore the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</E> If treatment has been prescribed for the annuitant which would be expected to restore his or her ability to work, he or she must follow that treatment in order to be paid a disability annuity. If the annuitant is not following that treatment and he or she does not have good cause for failing to follow the treatment, the Board will find that his or her disability has ended. The month such annuitant's disability ends will be the first month in which he or she failed to follow the prescribed treatment.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Evaluation steps.</E> To assure that disability reviews are carried out in a uniform manner, that decisions of continuing disability can be made in the most expeditious and administratively efficient way, and that any decisions to stop a disability annuity are made objectively, neutrally and are fully documented, the Board will follow specific steps in reviewing the question of whether an annuitant's disability continues. The Board's review may cease and the disability may be continued at any point if the Board determines that there is sufficient evidence to find that the annuitant is still unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. The steps are—</P>
              <P>(a) Is the annuitant engaging in substantial gainful activity? If he or she is (and any applicable trial work period has been completed), the Board will find disability to have ended (see § 220.179(a)(5));</P>
              <P>(b) If the annuitant is not engaging in substantial gainful activity, does he or she have an impairment or combination of impairments which is medically disabling? If the annuitant's impairment(s) is medically disabling, his or her disability will be found to continue;</P>
              <P>(c) If the annuitant's impairment(s) is not medically disabling, has there been medical improvement as defined in § 220.177(a)? If there has been medical improvement as shown by a decrease in medical severity, see step (d). If there has been no decrease in medical severity, then there has been no medical improvement; (See step (e));</P>
              <P>(d) If there has been medical improvement, the Board must determine whether it is related to the annuitant's ability to do work in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of § 220.177, (i.e., whether or not there has been an increase in the residual functional capacity based on the impairment(s) that was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical determination). If medical improvement is not related to the annuitant's ability to do work, see step (e). If medical improvement is related to the annuitant's ability to do work, see step (f);</P>
              <P>(e) If the Board found at step (c) that there has been no medical improvement or if it found at step (d) that the medical improvement is not related to the annuitant's ability to work, the Board considers whether any of the exceptions in § 220.178 apply. If none of them apply, disability will be found to continue. If one of the first group of exceptions to medical improvement applies, see step (f). If an exception from the second group of exceptions to medical improvement applies, disability will be found to have ended. The second group of exceptions to medical improvement may be considered at any point in this process;</P>

              <P>(f) If medical improvement is shown to be related to the annuitant's ability <PRTPAGE P="341"/>to do work or if one of the first group of exceptions to medical improvement applies, the Board will determine whether all of the annuitant's current impairments in combination are severe. This determination will consider all current impairments and the impact of the combination of those impairments on the ability to function. If the residual functional capacity assessment in step (d) above shows significant limitation of ability to do basic work activities, see step (g). When the evidence shows that all current impairments in combination do not significantly limit physical or mental abilities to do basic work activities, these impairments will not be considered severe in nature, and the annuitant will no longer be consider to be disabled;</P>
              <P>(g) If the annuitant's impairment(s) is severe, the Board will assess his or her current ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. That is, the Board will assess the annuitant's residual functional capacity based on all of his or her current impairments and consider whether he or she can still do work that was done in the past. If he or she can do such work, disability will be found to have ended; and</P>
              <P>(h) If the annuitant is not able to do work he or she has done in the past, the Board will consider one final step. Given the residual functional capacity assessment and considering the annuitant's age, education and past work experience, can he or she do other work? If the annuitant can do other work, disability will be found to have ended. If he or she cannot do other work, disability will be found to continue.</P>

              <P>(e) The first month in which the annuitant failed without good cause to do what the Board asked, when the rule set out in paragraph (b)(2) of § 220.179 applies;</P>

              <P>(i) The month the evidence shows that the annuitant is no longer disabled under the rules set out in §§ 220.177 through 220.180, and he or she was disabled only for a specified period <PRTPAGE P="342"/>of time in the past as discussed in § 220.21 or § 220.105;</P>

              <P>If a new severe impairment(s) begins in or before the month in which the last impairment(s) ends, the Board will find that disability is continuing. The impairment(s) need not be expected to last 12 months or to result in death, but it must be severe enough to keep the annuitant from doing substantial gainful activity, or severe enough so that he or she is still disabled.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The Board may conduct a review to find out whether the annuitant continues to be disabled.</SUBJECT>

              <P>After the Board finds that the annuitant is disabled, the Board must evaluate the annuitant's impairment(s) from time to time to determine if the annuitant is still eligible for disability cash benefits. The Board calls this evaluation a continuing disability review. The Board may begin a continuing disability review for any number of reasons including the annuitant's failure to follow the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act or these regulations. When the Board begins such a review, the Board will notify the annuitant <PRTPAGE P="343"/>that the Board is reviewing the annuitant's eligibility for disability benefits, why the Board is reviewing the annuitant's eligibility, that in medical reviews the medical improvement review standard will apply, that the Board's review could result in the termination of the annuitant's benefits, and that the annuitant has the right to submit medical and other evidence for the Board's consideration during the continuing disability review. In doing a medical review the Board will develop a complete medical history of at least the preceding 12 months in any case in which a determination is made that the annuitant is no longer under a disability. If this review shows that the Board should stop payment of cash benefits, the Board will notify the annuitant in writing and give the annuitant an opportunity to appeal. In § 220.186 the Board describes those events that may prompt it to review whether the annuitant continues to be disabled.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Board conducts continuing disability reviews to determine whether or not the annuitant continues to meet the disability requirements of the law. Payment of cash benefits or a period of disability ends if the medical or other evidence shows that the annuitant is not disabled under the standards set out in section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act or section 223(f) of the Social Security Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When the Board will conduct a continuing disability review.</E> A continuing disability review will be started if—</P>
              <P>(1) The annuitant has been scheduled for a medical improvement expected diary review;</P>
              <P>(2) The annuitant has been scheduled for a periodic review in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
              <P>(3) The Board needs a current medical or other report to see if the annuitant's disability continues. (This could happen when, for example, an advance in medical technology, such as improved treatment for Alzheimer's disease or a change in vocational therapy or technology raises a disability issue.);</P>
              <P>(4) The annuitant returns to work and successfully completes a period of trial work;</P>
              <P>(5) Substantial earnings are reported to the annuitant's wage record;</P>
              <P>(6) The annuitant tells the Board that he or she has recovered from his or her disability or that he or she has returned to work;</P>
              <P>(7) A State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency tells the Board that—</P>
              <P>(i) The services have been completed; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The annuitant is now working; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The annuitant is able to work;</P>
              <P>(8) Someone in a position to know of the annuitant's physical or mental condition tells the Board that the annuitant is not disabled, that the annuitant in not following prescribed treatment, that the annuitant has returned to work, or that the annuitant is failing to follow the provisions of the Social Security Act, the Railroad Retirement Act, or these regulations, and it appears that the report could be substantially correct; or</P>
              <P>(9) Evidence the Board receives raises a question as to whether the annuitant's disability continues.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section—</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Medical improvement expected diary—</E> refers to a case which is scheduled for review at a later date because the individual's impairment(s) is expected to improve. Generally, the diary period is set for not less than 6 months or for not more than 18 months. Examples of cases likely to be scheduled for a medical improvement excepted diary are fractures and cases in which corrective surgery is planned and recovery can be anticipated. The term “medical improvement expected diary” also includes a case which is scheduled for a review at a later date because the individual is undergoing vocational therapy, training or an educational program which may improve his or her ability to work so that the disability requirement of the law is no longer met. Generally, the diary period will be the length of the training, therapy, or program of education.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Permanent impairment medical improvement not expected—refers</E> to a case in <PRTPAGE P="344"/>which any medical improvement in the person's impairment(s) is not expected. This means an extremely severe condition determined on the basis of our experience in administering the disability program to be at least static, but more likely to be progressively disabling either by itself or by reason of impairment complications, and unlikely to improve so as to permit the individual to engage in substantial gainful activity. The interaction of the individual's age, impairment consequences and lack of recent attachment to the labor market may also be considered in determining whether an impairment is permanent. Improvement which is considered temporary under § 220.178(c)(3), will not be considered in deciding if an impairment is permanent. Examples of permanent impairments are as follows and are not intended to be all inclusive:</P>
              <P>(1) Parkinsonian syndrome with significant rigidity, brady kinesia, or tremor in two extremities, which, singly or in combination, result in sustained disturbance of gross and dexterous movements, or gait and station.</P>
              <P>(2) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, based on documentation of a clinically appropriate medical history, neurological findings consistent with the diagnosis of ALS, and the results of any electrophysiological and neuroimaging testing.</P>
              <P>(3) Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis in an individual age 55 or older which reduces FEV1 to 1.45 to 2.05 (L, BTPS) or less depending on the individual's height.</P>
              <P>(4) Amputation of leg at hip.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Nonpermanent impairment</E> refers to a case in which any medical improvement in the person's impairment(s) is possible. This means an impairment for which improvement cannot be predicted based on current experience and the facts of the particular case but which is not at the level of severity of an impairment that is considered permanent. Examples of nonpermanent impairments are: regional enteritis, hyperthyroidism, and chronic ulcerative colitis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Frequency of review.</E> If an annuitant's impairment is expected to improve, generally the Board will review the annuitant's continuing eligibility for disability benefits at intervals from 6 months to 18 months following the Board's most recent decision. The Board's notice to the annuitant about the review of the annuitant's case will tell the annuitant more precisely when the review will be conducted. If the annuitant's disability is not considered permanent but is such that any medical improvement in the annuitant's impairment(s) cannot be accurately predicted, the Board will review the annuitant's continuing eligibility for disability benefits at least once every 3 years. If no medical improvement is expected in the annuitant's impairment(s), the Board will not routinely review the annuitant's continuing eligibility. Regardless of the annuitant's classification, the Board will conduct an immediate continuing disability review if a question of continuing disability is raised pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Change in classification of impairment.</E> If the evidence developed during a continuing disability review demonstrates that the annuitant's impairment has improved, is expected to improve, or has worsened since the last review, the Board may reclassify the annuitant's impairment to reflect this change in severity. A change in the classification of the annuitant's impairment will change the frequency with which the Board will review the case. The Board may also reclassify certain impairments because of improved tests, treatment, and other technical advances concerning those impairments.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Review after administrative appeal.</E> If the annuitant was found eligible to receive or to continue to receive disability benefits on the basis of a decision by a hearings officer, the three-member Board or a Federal court, the agency will not conduct a continuing disability review earlier than 3 years after that decision unless the annuitant's case should be scheduled for a medical improvement expected or vocational reexamination diary review or a question of continuing disability is raised pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Waiver of timeframes.</E> All cases involving a nonpermanent impairment will be reviewed by the Board at least <PRTPAGE P="345"/>once every 3 years unless the Board determines that the requirements should be waived to ensure that only the appropriate number of cases are reviewed. The appropriate number of cases to be reviewed is to be based on such considerations as the backlog of pending reviews, the projected number of new applications, and projected staffing levels. Therefore, an annuitant's continuing disability review may be delayed longer than 3 years following the Board's original decision or other review under certain circumstances. Such a delay would be based on the Board's need to ensure that backlogs, and new disability claims workloads are accomplished within available medical and other resources and that such reviews are done carefully and accurately.</P>

              <P>If the annuitant's impairment was expected to improve and the annuitant returned to full-time work with no significant medical limitations and acknowledges that medical improvement has occurred, the Board may find that the annuitant's disability ended in the month he or she returned to work. Unless there is evidence showing that the annuitant's disability has not ended, the Board will use the medical and other evidence already in the annuitant's file and the fact that he or she has returned to full-time work without significant limitations to determine that the annuitant is no longer disabled. (If the annuitant's impairment is not expected to improve, the Board will not ordinarily review his or her claim until the end of the trial work period, as described in § 220.170.)

                <P>Evidence obtained during the processing of the annuitant's claim showed that the annuitant had an impairment that was expected to improve about 18 months after the annuitant's disability began. The Board, therefore, told the annuitant that his or her claim would be reviewed again at that time. However, before the time arrived for the annuitant's scheduled medical reexamination, the annuitant told the Board that he or she had returned to work and the annuitant's impairment had improved. The Board investigated immediately and found that, in the 16th month after the annuitant's began, the annuitant returned to full-time work without any significant medical restrictions. Therefore, the Board would find that the annuitant's disability ended in the first month the annuitant returned to full-time work.</P>

              <P>200.00 <E T="03">Introduction.</E> (a) The following rules reflect the major functional and vocational patterns which are encountered in cases which cannot be evaluated on medical considerations alone, where an individual with a severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) is not engaging in substantial gainful activity and the individual's impairment(s) prevents the performance of his or her vocationally relevant past work. They also reflect the analysis of the various vocational factors (i.e., age, education, and work experience) in combination with the individual's residual functional capacity (used to determine his or her maximum sustained work capability for sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy work) in evaluating the individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity in other than his or her vocationally relevant past work. Where the findings of fact made with respect to a particular individual's vocational factors and residual functional capacity coincide with all of the criteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the individual is or is not disabled. However, each of these findings of fact is subject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such findings. Where any one of the findings of fact does not coincide with the corresponding criterion of a rule, the rule does not apply in that particular case and, accordingly, does <PRTPAGE P="346"/>not direct a conclusion of disabled or not disabled. In any instance where a rule does not apply, full consideration must be given to all of the relevant facts of the case in accordance with the definitions and discussions of each factor in the appropriate sections of the regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) The existence of jobs in the national economy is reflected in the “Decisions” shown in the rules; i.e., in promulgating the rules, administrative notice has been taken of the numbers of unskilled jobs that exist throughout the national economy at the various functional levels (sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy) as supported by the “Dictionary of Occupational Titles” and the “Occupational Outlook Handbook,” published by the Department of Labor; the “County Business Patterns” and “Census Surveys” published by the Bureau of the Census; and occupational surveys of light and sedentary jobs prepared for the Social Security Administration by various State employment agencies. Thus, when all factors coincide with the criteria of a rule, the existence of such jobs is established. However, the existence of such jobs for individuals whose remaining functional capacity or other factors do not coincide with the criteria of a rule must be further considered in terms of what kinds of jobs or types of work may be either additionally indicated or precluded.</P>

              <P>(c) In the application of the rules, the individual's residual functional capacity (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the maximum degree to which the individual retains the capacity for sustained performance of the physical-mental requirements of jobs), age, education, and work experience must first be determined. When assessing the person's residual functional capacity, the Board considers his or her symptoms (such as pain), signs, and laboratory findings together with other evidence the Board obtains.</P>
              <P>(d) The correct disability decision (i.e., on the issue of ability to engage in substantial gainful activity) is found by then locating the individual's specific vocational profile. If an individual's specific profile is not listed within this appendix 2, a conclusion of disabled or not disabled is not directed. Thus, for example, an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful work where his or her residual functional capacity falls between the ranges of work indicated in the rules (e.g., the individual who can perform more than light but less than medium work), is decided on the basis of the principles and definitions in the regulations, giving consideration to the rules for specific case situations in this appendix 2. These rules represent various combinations of exertional capabilities, age, education and work experience and also provide an overall structure for evaluation of those cases in which the judgments as to each factor do not coincide with those of any specific rule. Thus, when the necessary judgments have been made as to each factor and it is found that no specific rule applies, the rules still provide guidance for decisionmaking, such as in cases involving combinations of impairments. For example, if strength limitations resulting from an individual's impairment(s) considered with the judgments made as to the individual's age, education and work experience correspond to (or closely approximate) the factors of a particular rule, the adjudicator then has a frame of reference for considering the jobs or types of work precluded by other, nonexertional impairments in terms of numbers of jobs remaining for a particular individual.</P>
              <P>(e) Since the rules are predicated on an individual's having an impairment which manifests itself by limitations in meeting the strength requirements of jobs, they may not be fully applicable where the nature of an individual's impairment does not result in such limitations, e.g., certain mental, sensory, or skin impairments. In addition, some impairments may result solely in postural and manipulative limitations or environmental restrictions. Environmental restrictions are those restrictions which result in inability to tolerate some physical feature(s) of work settings that occur in certain industries or types of work, e.g., an inability to tolerate dust or fumes.</P>
              <P>(1) In the evaluation of disability where the individual has solely a nonexertional type of impairment, determination as to whether disability exists shall be based on the principles in the appropriate sections of the regulations, giving consideration to the rules for specific case situations in this appendix 2. The rules do not direct factual conclusions of disabled or not disabled for individuals with solely nonexertional types of impairments.</P>

              <P>(2) However, where an individual has an impairment or combination of impairments resulting in both strength limitations and nonexertional limitations, the rules in this subpart are considered in determining first whether a finding of disabled may be possible based on the strength limitations alone and, if not, the rule(s) reflecting the individual's maximum residual strength capabilities, age, education, and work experience provide a framework for consideration of how much the individual's work capability is further diminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be contraindicated by the nonexertional limitations. Also, in these combinations of nonexertional and exertional limitations which cannot be wholly determined under the rules in this appendix 2, full consideration must be given to all of the relevant facts in the case in accordance with the definitions and discussions of each factor in the appropriate sections of the regulations, which will provide insight into the adjudicative weight to be accorded each factor.<PRTPAGE P="347"/>
              </P>
              <P>201.00 <E T="03">Maximum sustained work capability limited to sedentary work as a result of severe medically determinable impairment(s).</E> (a) Most sedentary occupations fall within the skilled, semi-skilled, professional, administrative, technical, clerical, and benchwork classifications. Approximately 200 separate unskilled sedentary occupations can be identified, each representing numerous jobs in the national economy. Approximately 85 percent of these jobs are in the machine trades and benchwork occupational categories. These jobs (unskilled sedentary occupations) may be performed after a short demonstration or within 30 days.</P>
              <P>(b) These unskilled sedentary occupations are standard within the industries in which they exist. While sedentary work represents a significantly restricted range of work, this range in itself is not so prohibitively restricted as to negate work capability for substantial gainful activity.</P>
              <P>(c) Vocational adjustment to sedentary work may be expected where the individual has special skills or experience relevant to sedentary work or where age and basic educational competences provide sufficient occupational mobility to adapt to the major segment of unskilled sedentary work. Inability to engage in substantial gainful activity would be indicated where an individual who is restricted to sedentary work because of a severe medically determinable impairment lacks special skills or experience relevant to sedentary work, lacks educational qualifications relevant to most sedentary work (e.g., has a limited education or less) and the individual's age, though not necessarily advanced, is a factor which significantly limits vocational adaptability.</P>
              <P>(d) The adversity of functional restrictions to sedentary work at advanced age (55 and over) for individuals with no relevant past work or who can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work and have no transferable skills, warrants a finding of disabled in the absence of the rare situation where the individual has recently completed education which provides a basis for direct entry into skilled sedentary work. Advanced age and a history of unskilled work or no work experience would ordinarily offset any vocational advantages that might accrue by reason of any remote past education, whether it is more or less than limited education.</P>
              <P>(e) The presence of acquired skills that are readily transferable to a significant range of skilled work within an individual's residual functional capacity would ordinarily warrant a finding of ability to engage in substantial gainful activity regardless of the adversity of age, or whether the individual's formal education is commensurate with his or her demonstrated skill level. The acquisition of work skills demonstrates the ability to perform work at the level of complexity demonstrated by the skill level attained regardless of the individual's formal educational attainments.</P>
              <P>(f) In order to find transferability of skills to skilled sedentary work for individuals who are of advanced age (55 and over), there must be very little, if any, vocational adjustment required in terms of tools, work processes, work settings, or the industry.</P>
              <P>(g) Individuals approaching advanced age (age 50-54) may be significantly limited in vocational adaptability if they are restricted to sedentary work. When such individuals have no past work experience or can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work and have no transferable skills, a finding of disabled ordinarily obtains. However, recently completed education which provides for direct entry into sedentary work will preclude such a finding. For this age group, even a high school education or more (ordinarily completed in the remote past) would have little impact for effecting a vocational adjustment unless relevant work experience reflects use of such education.</P>

              <P>(h) The term “younger individual” is used to denote an individual age 18 through 49. For those within this group who are age 45-49, age is a less positive factor than for those who are age 18-44. Accordingly, for such individuals; (1) who are restricted to sedentary work, (2) who are unskilled or have no transferable skills, (3) who have no relevant past work or who can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work, and (4) who are either illiterate or unable to communicate in the English language, a finding of disabled is warranted. On the other hand, age is a more positive factor for those who are under age 45 and is usually not a significant factor in limiting such an individual's ability to make a vocational adjustment, even an adjustment to unskilled sedentary work, and even where the individual is illiterate or unable to communicate in English. However, a finding of disabled is not precluded for those individuals under age 45 who do not meet all of the criteria of a specific rule and who do not have the ability to perform a full range of sedentary work. The following examples are illustrative: Example 1: An individual under age 45 with a high school education can no longer do past work and is restricted to unskilled sedentary jobs because of a severe medically determinable cardiovascular impairment (which does not meet or equal the listings in appendix 1). A permanent injury of the right hand limits the individual to sedentary jobs which do not require bilateral manual dexterity. None of the rules in appendix 2 are applicable to this particular set of facts, because this individual cannot perform the full range of work defined as sedentary. Since the inability to perform jobs requiring bilateral manual dexterity significantly compromises the only range of work for which the individual is otherwise qualified (i.e., sedentary), a finding of disabled <PRTPAGE P="348"/>would be appropriate. Example 2: An illiterate 41 year old individual with mild mental retardation (IQ of 78) is restricted to unskilled sedentary work and cannot perform vocationally relevant past work, which had consisted of unskilled agricultural field work; his or her particular characteristics do not specifically meet any of the rules in appendix 2, because this individual cannot perform the full range of work defined as sedentary. In light of the adverse factors which further narrow the range of sedentary work for which this individual is qualified, a finding of disabled is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(i) While illiteracy or the inability to communicate in English may significantly limit an individual's vocational scope, the primary work functions in the bulk of unskilled work relate to working with things (rather than with data or people) and in these work functions at the unskilled level, literacy or ability to communicate in English has the least significance. Similarly the lack of relevant work experience would have little significance since the bulk of unskilled jobs require no qualifying work experience. Thus, the functional capability for a full range of sedentary work represents sufficient numbers of jobs to indicate substantial vocational scope for those individuals age 18-44 even if they are illiterate or unable to communicate in English.</P>

              <P>202.00 <E T="03">Maximum sustained work capability limited to light work as a result of severe medically determinable impairment(s).</E> (a) The functional capacity to perform a full range of light work includes the functional capacity to perform sedentary as well as light work. Approximately 1,600 separate sedentary and light unskilled occupations can be identified in eight broad occupational categories, each occupation representing numerous jobs in the national economy. These jobs can be performed after a short demonstration or within 30 days, and do not require special skills or experience.</P>
              <P>(b) The functional capacity to perform a wide or full range of light work represents substantial work capability compatible with making a work adjustment to substantial numbers of unskilled jobs and, thus, generally provides sufficient occupational mobility even for severely impaired individuals who are not of advanced age and have sufficient educational competences for unskilled work.</P>
              <P>(c) However, for individuals of advanced age who can no longer perform vocationally relevant past work and who have a history of unskilled work experience, or who have only skills that are not readily transferable to a significant range of semi-skilled or skilled work that is within the individual's functional capacity, or who have no work experience, the limitations in vocational adaptability represented by functional restriction to light work warrant a finding of disabled. Ordinarily, even a high school education or more which was completed in the remote past will have little positive impact on effecting a vocational adjustment unless relevant work experience reflects use of such education.</P>
              <P>(d) Where the same factors in paragraph (c) of this section regarding education and work experience are present, but where age, though not advanced, is a factor which significantly limits vocational adaptability (i.e., closely approaching advanced age, 50-54) and an individual's vocational scope is further significantly limited by illiteracy or inability to communicate in English, a finding of disabled is warranted.</P>
              <P>(e) The presence of acquired skills that are readily transferable to a significant range of semi-skilled or skilled work within an individual's residual functional capacity would ordinarily warrant a finding of not disabled regardless of the adversity of age, or whether the individual's formal education is commensurate with his or her demonstrated skill level. The acquisition of work skills demonstrates the ability to perform work at the level of complexity demonstrated by the skill level attained regardless of the individual's formal educational attainments.</P>
              <P>(f) For a finding of transferability of skills to light work for individuals of advanced age who are closely approaching retirement age (age 60-64), there must be very little, if any, vocational adjustment required in terms of tools, work processes, work settings, or the industry.</P>

              <P>(g) While illiteracy or the inability to communicate in English may significantly limit an individual's vocational scope, the primary <PRTPAGE P="350"/>work functions in the bulk of unskilled work relate to working with things (rather than with data or people) and in these work functions at the unskilled level, literacy or ability to communicate in English has the least significance. Similarly, the lack of relevant work experience would have little significance since the bulk of unskilled jobs require no qualifying work experience. The capability for light work, which includes the ability to do sedentary work, represents the capability for substantial numbers of such jobs. This, in turn, represents substantial vocational scope for younger individuals (age 18-49) even if illiterate or unable to communicate in English.</P>

              <P>203.00 <E T="03">Maximum sustained work capability limited to medium work as a result of severe medically determinable impair- ment(s).</E> (a) The functional capacity to perform medium work includes the functional capacity to perform sedentary, light, and medium work. Approximately 2,500 separate sedentary, light, and medium occupations can be identified, each occupation representing numerous jobs in the national economy which do not require <PRTPAGE P="351"/>skills or previous experience and which can be performed after a short demonstration or within 30 days.</P>
              <P>(b) The functional capacity to perform medium work represents such substantial work capability at even the unskilled level that a finding of disabled is ordinarily not warranted in cases where a severely impaired individual retains the functional capacity to perform medium work. Even the adversity of advanced age (55 or over) and a work history of unskilled work may be offset by the substantial work capability represented by the functional capacity to perform medium work. However, an individual with a marginal education and long work experience (i.e., 35 years or more) limited to the performance of arduous unskilled labor, who is not working and is no longer able to perform this labor because of a severe impairment(s), may still be found disabled even though the individual is able to do medium work.</P>
              <P>(c) However, the absence of any relevant work experience becomes a more significant adversity for individuals of advanced age (55 and over). Accordingly, this factor, in combination with a limited education or less, militates against making a vocational adjustment to even this substantial range of work and a finding of disabled is appropriate. Further, for individuals closely approaching retirement age (60-64) with a work history of unskilled work and with marginal education or less, a finding of disabled is appropriate.</P>

              <P>204.00 <E T="03">Maximum sustained work capability limited to heavy work (or very heavy work) as a result of severe medically determinable impairment(s).</E> The residual functional capacity to perform heavy work or very heavy work includes the functional capability for work at the lesser functional levels as well, and represents substantial work capability for jobs in the national economy at all skill and physical demand levels. Individuals who retain the functional capacity to perform heavy work (or very heavy work) ordinarily will not have a severe impairment or will be able to do their past work—either of which would have already provided a basis for a decision of “not disabled”. Environmental restrictions ordinarily would not significantly affect the range of work existing in the national economy for individuals with the physical capability for heavy work (or very heavy work). Thus an impairment which does not preclude heavy work (or very heavy work) would not ordinarily be the primary reason for unemployment, and generally is sufficient for a finding of not disabled, even though age, education, and skill level of prior work experience may be considered adverse.</P>

              <EAR>Pt. 220, App. 3</EAR>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix 3 to Part 220—Railroad Retirement Board Occupational Disability Standards</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. Introduction</HD>
              <P>1.01 The Board uses this appendix to adjudicate the occupational disability claims of employees with medical conditions and job titles covered by the Tables in this appendix. The Tables are divided into “Body Parts”, with each Body Part further divided by job title. Under each job title there is a list of impairments and tests with accompanying test results which establish a finding of “D” (disabled). The use of these Tables is a three-step process. In the first step we determine whether the employee's regular railroad occupation is covered by the Tables; next we establish the existence of an impairment covered by the Tables; finally, we reach a disability determination. If we do not find an employee disabled under these Tables, the employee may still be found disabled using Independent Case Evaluation (ICE), as explained in subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>1.02 The Cancer Tables are treated in a different way than other body systems. Different types of cancer and their treatments have different functional impacts. In the Cancer Tables the impact of the impairment is seen as being significant or not significant. Therefore, these tables contain an “S” (significant) which is equivalent to a “D” rating. A detailed explanation of how to use those tables is in that section. The steps to use the remaining Tables are explained below:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Confirming the Impairment</HD>
              <P>2.01 Once we determine that the employee's regular railroad occupation is covered by the Job Titles in the Tables, we must determine the existence of an impairment covered by the Tables. This is done through the use of Confirmatory Tests. These tests can include information from medical records, surgical or operative reports, or specific diagnostic test results. Confirmatory Tests are listed in the initial section regarding each Body Part covered in the Tables. If an impairment cannot be confirmed because of inconsistent medical information, ICE may be required.</P>
              <P>2.02 There are two types of Confirmatory Tests as follows.</P>

              <P>2.03 “Highly Recommended” Tests—The designation of a confirmatory test as being “highly recommended” means that the test is almost always performed to confirm the existence of the impairment. For many conditions, only one “highly recommended” test finding is suggested to confirm the impairment. However, there may be times when that test is not available or is negative, but <PRTPAGE P="353"/>other more detailed testing confirms the impairment.</P>
              <P>2.04 <E T="03">Example A:</E> To confirm the condition of pulmonary hypertension, the Tables under Body Part C., Cardiac, designate as “highly recommended”: an electrocardiogram which indicates definite right ventricular hypertrophy. However, the impairment may also be confirmed by insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter into the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary artery pressure measured directly.</P>
              <P>2.05 There may be some conditions for which several “highly recommended” tests are suggested to confirm an impairment. In these circumstances, we will use all “highly recommended” tests to establish the existence of the impairment.</P>
              <P>2.06 <E T="03">Example B:</E> Under Body Part E., Lumbar Sacral Spine, three highly recommended medical findings are identified for the diagnosis of chronic back pain, not otherwise specified. These findings include:</P>
              <P>A. A history of back pain under medical treatment for at least one year, and</P>
              <P>B. A history of back pain unresponsive to therapy for at least one year, and</P>
              <P>C. A history of back pain with functional limitations for at least one year.</P>
              <P>2.07 All three of these criteria must be satisfied to confirm the existence of chronic back pain.</P>
              <P>2.08 Sometimes the employee may have undergone detailed testing which is as reliable as one of the “highly recommended” tests listed in the Tables. In cases where an impairment has not been confirmed by one of the designated “highly recommended” tests, the impairment may still be confirmed by “recommended” tests (see below) or by evidence acceptable under section 220.27 of this part.</P>
              <P>2.09 Recommended Tests—The designation of a confirmatory test as “recommended” means that the test need not be performed, or be positive, to confirm the impairment. However, a positive test provides significant support for confirming the impairment. If there are no “highly recommended” tests for confirming the impairment, at least one of the “recommended” tests should be positive.</P>
              <P>2.10 There are two categories of recommended tests which are described below.</P>
              <P>A. <E T="03">Imaging studies</E>—These studies can include MRI, CAT scan, myelogram, or plain film x-rays. For conditions where several of these imaging studies are identified as “recommended” tests, at least one of the test results should be positive and meet the confirmatory test criteria. For some conditions, such as degenerative disc condition, there are several equivalent imaging methods to confirm a diagnosis.</P>
              <P>B. <E T="03">Other tests</E>—This category of tests refers to non-imaging studies.</P>
              <P>2.11 If there are no “highly recommended” confirmatory tests designated to confirm an impairment and the “recommended” confirmatory tests only include non-imaging procedures, at least one of these tests should be positive to confirm the impairment. The greater the number of tests that are positive, the greater the confidence that the correct diagnosis has been established.</P>
              <P>2.12 <E T="03">Example:</E> Under Body Part C., Cardiac, the diagnostic confirmatory tests for ventricular ectopy, a cardiac arrhythmia, include the following “recommended” tests:</P>
              <P>A. Medical record review, i.e., a review of the claimant's medical records, or</P>
              <P>B. Holter monitoring, or</P>
              <P>C. Provocative testing producing a definite arrhythmia.</P>
              <P>2.13 In this situation, only one of the “recommended” confirmatory tests need be positive to confirm the impairment. However, the more tests that are positive, the stronger the support for the diagnosis.</P>
              <P>2.14 In no circumstance will the Board require that an invasive test be performed to confirm an impairment. Several of the Confirmatory Tests which are described in the Tables are invasive and it is not the intention of the Board to suggest that these be performed. The inclusion of invasive tests in the Tables Confirmatory Tests section is intended to help the Board evaluate the significance of findings from such tests that may have already been performed and which are part of the submitted medical record.</P>
              <P>2.15 If an employee's impairment(s) cannot be confirmed by use of the confirmatory tests listed in the Tables, it still may be confirmed by medical evidence described in section 220.27 of this part. However, if a claimant's impairment(s) cannot be confirmed through use of the Tables or under section 220.27, and the medical evidence is complete and in concordance, the claimant will be found not disabled.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Disability Determination</HD>
              <P>3.01 Once the Board determines that the employee's regular railroad occupation is covered by one of the Job Titles in the Tables and that his or her alleged impairment fits into a Body Part covered by the Tables and can be confirmed, we examine the results of any of the disability tests listed under the impairment. If the results from any of these tests indicate a “D” finding, the employee is found disabled. If none of the test results indicate a “D” finding, then the employee's claim is evaluated using ICE.</P>
              <P>3.02 <E T="03">Example:</E> A trainman has angina as confirmed by the recommended tests under Body Part A: Cardiac—Angina. An echocardiogram shows that he has poor ejection fraction ≤35%. The employee is rated disabled. If none of the results of the listed disability tests match the results required for a “D” finding, then the employee's claim is evaluated under ICE.<PRTPAGE P="354"/>

              <P>Cancer conditions can be viewed as belonging to one of three categories.</P>
              <P>Category 1: Significant impact on functional capacity or anticipated life span.</P>
              <P>Category 2: Intermediate impact on functional capacity; large individual variability.</P>
              <P>Category 3: No significant impact on functional capacity or expected life span.</P>
              <P>The factors that are considered in developing these categories include the following:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Type of Cancer</HD>
              <P>The functional impact of different malignancies varies tremendously and each malignancy has to be considered on an individual basis.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Magnitude of Disease</HD>
              <P>The disability standards are based upon the magnitude or extent of disease. The extent of disease affects both anticipated life span and the functional capacity or work ability of the individual. Localized cancer including cancer “in situ” can frequently be completely cured and not have an impact on functional capacity or life span. In contrast, many cancers that have distant or significant regional spread generally have a poor prognosis. The magnitude or extent of disease is classified into three categories: local, regional and distant.</P>
              <P>The criteria which are used to classify a cancer into one of the three categories are based upon the distillation of several staging methods into a single system [Miller, et al. (1992). Cancer Statistics Review, 1973-1989; NIH Publication No. 92-2789].</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Effects of Treatment</HD>
              <P>Although some types of cancer may be potentially curable with radical surgery and/or radiation therapy, the treatment regimen may result in a significant impairment that could affect functional capacity and ability to work. For example, a person with a laryngeal tumor which had spread regionally could be cured by a complete laryngectomy and radiotherapy. However, this treatment could result in a loss of speech and significantly impair the individual's communicative skills or ability to use certain types of respiratory protective equipment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Prognosis</HD>
              <P>Some cancers may have minimal impact on a person's functional capacity, but have a very poor prognosis with respect to life expectancy. For example, an individual with early stage brain cancer may be minimally impaired, but have a poor prognosis and minimal potential for surviving longer than two years. Five and two year survival data are presented in the Cancer Disability Guideline Table which follows.</P>
              <P>The Cancer Disability Guideline Table provides information concerning the probability of survival for five years for local, regional, and distant disease for each type of malignancy. In addition, two-year survival data are also presented for all disease stages. The five-year survival data are based upon data collected from population-based registries in Connecticut, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, Atlanta, Detroit, Seattle and the San Francisco and East Bay area between 1983 and 1987 (Miller, 1992). The two-year data are from a cohort study initially diagnosed in 1988.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Assessment</HD>
              <P>The malignancies are classified as disabling (Category 1), potentially disabling (Category 2) and non-disabling (Category 3). Category 2 conditions must be evaluated with respect to how the worker's tumor affects the worker's ability to perform the job and an assessment of his life span.</P>

              <P>Information concerning the potential impact of the malignancy on a worker's ability to perform a job is identified in the Functional Impact column in the table. All railroad occupations in the Tables are considered together. Functional impacts are classified as significant if the treatment or sequelae from treatment including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or surgery is likely to impair the worker from performing the job. If the treatment results in a significant impairment of another organ system, the individual should be evaluated for disability associated with impairment of that body part. For example, a person undergoing an amputation for a bone malignancy would have to be evaluated for an amputation of that body part. For many cancers, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding the level of impairment that will occur after the person has initiated or completed treatment. Nonsignificant impacts include those that are unlikely to have any effect on the individual's work capacity.<PRTPAGE P="355"/>

              <P>(b) The claimant's relationship as the widow(er) of an employee is determined as of the date on which the employee died. If the claimant applied for a lump-sum payment as the widow(er) of the employee, one of the following determinations is made:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the widow(er) was living in the same household as the employee, as defined in § 222.16 of this part, at the time of the employee's death, if the claimant is applying for the 1974 Act lump-sum death payment.</P>

              <P>(2) Whether the widow(er) was living with the employee, as defined in § 222.15 of this part, at the time of the employee's death, if the claimant is applying for the 1937 Act lump-sum death payment, annuities due but unpaid at death, the residual lump-sum payment, or a lump-sum refund payment.<PRTPAGE P="417"/>

              <P>(a) The claimant married the employee in a civil or religious ceremony.</P>
              <P>(b) The claimant went through the marriage ceremony in good faith. Good faith means that at the time of the ceremony the claimant did not know that a legal impediment existed, or if the claimant did know, he or she thought that it would not prevent a valid marriage.</P>

              <P>(i) The spouse applied for an annuity based on having the employee's child in care; or</P>

              <P>(iii) The employee died, if the claimant is applying for a child's annuity or lump-sum payment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of state laws</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> To determine whether a claimant is the natural child of the employee, the state inheritance laws regarding whether the claimant could inherit a child's share of the employee's personal property if he or she were to die intestate will apply. If such laws would permit the claimant to inherit the employee's personal property, the claimant will be considered the child of the employee. The state inheritance laws where the employee was domiciled when he or she died will apply. If the employee's domicile was not in one of the 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin slands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands, the laws of the District of Columbia will apply.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards.</E> The Board will not apply any state inheritance law requirement that an action to establish paternity must have been commenced within a specific time period, measured from the employee's death or the child's birth, or that an action to establish paternity must have been commenced or completed before the employee's death. If state laws on inheritance require a court to determine paternity, the Board will not require such a determination, but the Board will decide paternity using the standard of proof that the state court would apply as the basis for making such a determination.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Employee is living.</E> If the employee is living, the Board will apply the state law where the employee is domiciled which was in effect when the annuity may first be increased under the social security overall minimum (see part 229 of this chapter). If under a version of state law in effect at that time, a person does not qualify as a child of the employee, the Board will look to all versions of state law in effect from when the employee's annuity may first have been increased until the Board makes a final decision, and will apply the version of state law most favorable to the employee.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Employee is deceased.</E> The Board will apply the state law where the employee was domiciled when he or she died. The Board will apply the version of state law in effect at the time of the final decision on the application for benefits.

              <P>(a) An employee is contributing to the support of a person if the employee gives cash, goods, or services to help support such person. Support includes food, clothing, housing, routine medical care, and other ordinary and necessary living expenses. The value of any goods which the employee contributes shall be based upon the replacement cost of those goods at the time they are contributed. If the employee provides services that would otherwise require monetary payment, the cash value of the employee's services may be considered a contribution to support.</P>
              <P>(b) The employee is contributing to the support of a person if that person receives an allotment, allowance, or benefit based upon the employee's military pay, veteran's pension or compensation, social security earnings, or railroad compensation.</P>
              <P>(c) Contributions must be made regularly and must be large enough to meet an important part of the person's ordinary and necessary living expenses. If the employee provides only occasional gifts or donations for special purposes, they will not be considered contributions for support. Although the employee's contributions must be made on a regular basis, temporary interruptions caused by circumstances beyond the employee's control, such as illness or unemployment, will be disregarded unless during these interruptions someone else assumes responsibility for support of the person on a regular basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How the one-half support determination is made.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount of contributions.</E> The employee provides one-half support to a person if the employee makes regular contributions to that person's support, and the amount of the contributions is equal to or in excess of one-half of the person's ordinary and necessary living expenses. Ordinary and necessary living expenses are the costs for food, clothing, housing, routine medical care, and similar necessities. A contribution may be in cash, goods, or services (see § 222.42 of this part). For example, an employee pays rent and utilities amounting to $6,000 per year on an apartment in which his mother resides. In addition, the employee's mother receives $3,600 per year in social security benefits which she uses to pay for her food, clothing and medical care. The mother's total necessary living expenses are $9,600 ($6,000 + $3,600). Since the employee contributes $6,000 toward these expenses, he is contributing in excess of one-half of his mother's support.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reasonable period of time.</E> The employee is not providing at least one-half of a person's support unless the employee has made contributions for a reasonable period of time. Ordinarily, the Board will consider a reasonable period of time to be the 12-month period immediately preceding the time when the one-half support requirement must be satisfied. However, if the employee provided one-half or more of the person's support for at least 3 months of the 12-month period, and was forced to stop or reduce contributions because of circumstances beyond his or her control, such as illness or unemployment, and no one else took over responsibility for providing at least one-half of the person's support on a permanent basis, three months shall be considered a reasonable period of time.</P>

A stepgrandchild is not included in this class of beneficiary.</P>

              <P>An employee's equitably adopted child, as defined in § 222.34, is considered dependent upon the employee if the employee was either living with or contributing to the support of the child at the time of his or her death. If the equitable adoption is found to have occurred after the employee could have become entitled to an old age or disability benefit under the Social Security Act (treating his or her railroad compensation as wages under that Act), the child is not considered dependent on the employee during the employee's lifetime. If the equitable adoption took place before such time, the child is dependent on the employee if the employee was living with or contributing to the support of the child at one of the times shown in § 222.51.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When a child is living with an employee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A child is living with the employee if the child normally lives in the same household with the employee and the employee has parental control and authority over the child's activities. The child is considered to be “living with” the employee while they are living apart if they expect to live together again after a temporary separation. A temporary separation may include the employee's absence because of working away from home or hospitalization. However, the employee must have parental control and authority over the child during the period of temporary separation. A child who is in active military service or in prison is not “living with” the employee, since the employee does not have parental control over the child.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part discusses Primary Insurance Amount, which is referred to as PIA throughout this part, and which is an important element in the calculation of any retirement or survivor annuity. There are a number of PIA computations based on different periods, amounts, and types of earnings. However, the formulas for computing any PIA are prescribed in section 215 of the Social Security Act and are described in detail in the regulations of the Social Security Administration (20 CFR part 404, subpart C). This part discusses PIA computation formulas and relates them to the PIA's which the Board uses. Descriptions of the majority of PIA's used in computing retirement or survivor annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act are contained in this part. Explanations are included of when delayed retirement credits and cost-of-living increases can be added to the PIA's used by the Board. This part also explains when and how a PIA is recomputed or adjusted. Since these regulations are intended to address annuities currently being awarded, certain PIA's, not used in the computation of annuities awarded after August 13, 1981, are not included in these regulations. Parts 226, 228 and 229 of this chapter explain how PIA's are used in actual annuity computations.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Average Indexed Monthly Earnings</E> means the result of dividing the total of the indexed earnings through the indexing year and the nonindexed earnings after the indexing year in the benefit computation years by the number of months in the benefit computation years. The indexing year for the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA is the second year before the employee's eligibility year. Indexing of an employee's yearly earnings serves to put the earnings in proportion to the earnings level of all workers for the corresponding years, and to express the earnings in terms of a more recent dollar value. Indexed earnings are determined under section 215(b)(1) of the Social Security Act. The Average Indexed Monthly Earnings formula PIA is based on the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings amount.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Average Monthly Earnings</E> means the average determined by dividing the acutal earnings used in computing the PIA by the total months in the benefit computation years. The Average Monthly Earnings is determined under section 215(b)(4) of the Social Security Act. The Average Monthly Earnings formula PIA is based on the Average Monthly Earnings amount.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Employee</E> means any person who is working or has worked for a railroad employer who is eligible for a retirement annuity or on whose account a survivor is eligible for a survivor annuity, as explained in part 216 of this chapter. For a detailed discussion of Employees under the Railroad Retirement Act, see part 203 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Entitled</E> means that a person meets the necessary requirements, files a valid application and establishes his or her right to payment.</P>

                <E T="03">Primary Insurance Amount</E> (PIA) means the result obtained by applying one of three formulas in the Social Security Act to the employee's earnings as prescribed under that Act. A PIA can be based on the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings formula, the Average Monthly Earnings formula or, in the case of the Special Minimum PIA, on a special formula based on years of coverage. Averaging earnings and PIA formulas are prescribed in section 215 of the Social Security Act.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Social Security Act</E> means the Social Security Act as amended from time to time, unless the Act as in effect on a particular date is specified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>PIA computation formulas.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> PIA's are generally computed under one of two normal formulas determined by the employee's eligibility year. In addition, there is a special PIA formula, based on an employee's years of coverage, that is used when it produces a PIA that is higher than the PIA computed under the appropriate PIA formula. The two most common PIA formulas are the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA formula and the Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula. The special PIA formula is called the Special Minimum PIA formula.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA formula.</E> When the employee's eligibility year is after 1978, the Tier I PIA, Overall Minimum PIA, Survivor <PRTPAGE P="430"/>Tier I PIA, Employee's Retirement Insurance Benefit PIA and Residual Lump-Sum PIA are computed under the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings PIA formula.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula.</E> The Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula is used to compute a PIA for one of two reasons: either the employee's eligibility year is before 1979 or the type of PIA requires that it always be computed under the Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Use of Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula based on the employee's eligibility year.</E> The Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula is used in computing the Tier I PIA, the Overall Minimum PIA, the Employee Fictional Retirement Insurance Benefit PIA and the Residual Lump-Sum PIA when the employee's eligibility year is before 1979.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Types of PIA's always computed using the Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula.</E> The following PIA's used by the Board are determined under the Social Security Act as in effect on December 31, 1974, and are always computed using the Average Monthly Earnings PIA formula.</P>
              <P>(i) Combined Earnings Dual Benefit PIA described in § 225.12.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Special Minimum PIA formula.</E> The Special Minimum PIA formula is based on the employee's years of coverage. The Special Minimum PIA formula usually applies when the employee had consistently low earnings during his or her working lifetime. The Special Minimum PIA formula is used when it is higher than the PIA calculated under the applicable Average Indexed Monthly Earnings formula or the Average Monthly Earnings formula.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on amount of earnings used to compute a PIA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Certain PIA's used by the Board are based on a combination of compensation and wages, while other PIA's used by the Board are based solely on either compensation or wages. For purposes of crediting earnings when computing any PIA, compensation is always treated as wages. Regardless of whether a PIA is based on a combination of compensation and wages or exclusively on either compensation or wages, the total earnings for each year used in computing a PIA cannot be higher than the maximum social security earnings creditable in that year under sections 209(a) and 211(b) of the Social Security Act. The various PIA's used by the Board are described in subparts B and C of this part.</P>

              <P>This subpart contains information about the PIA's that can be used in computing most employee, spouse and divorced spouse annuities. The Tier I PIA is used in computing the tier I component of an employee, spouse or divorced spouse annuity. The Combined Earnings Dual Benefit PIA, Social Security Earnings Dual Benefit PIA and Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA are used in computing an employee's vested dual benefit component and a corresponding tier II component offset when entitlement to a vested dual benefit exists. Retirement annuity computations are discussed in part 226 of this chapter. The Overall Minimum PIA is used in computing the overall minimum guaranty formula rate as discussed in part 229 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Tier I PIA is used in computing an employee, spouse or divorced spouse tier I amount. Except for the cases described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, a Tier I PIA is determined under sections 215 and 223 of the Social Security Act. Railroad <PRTPAGE P="431"/>and Social Security earnings are included in the calculation of a Tier I PIA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Employee attains age 60 and/or acquires 30 years of service after June 30, 1984.</E> When an employee is entitled to an age and service annuity before the month of attaining age 62, as explained in part 216 of this chapter, the following Railroad Retirement Act rules apply in addition to those in § 225.11(a) in computing the Tier I PIA.</P>
              <P>(1) Four months before the first full month the employee is age 62, the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings is determined as if the employee's eligibility year were the year the annuity began.</P>
              <P>(2) The benefit computation years used in computing the Tier I PIA are based on the date of the employee's actual attainment of age 62.</P>

              <P>(b) Recomputation when an employee is eligible for periodic pension payments based on other than railroad or social security earnings.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recomputation to consider additional earnings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Additional earnings that cause a recomputation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Earnings not included in earlier computation or recomputation.</E> The most common reason for recomputing a PIA is to include earnings that were not used previously, as described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section. The inclusion of these earnings may result in a revised Average Monthly Earnings or revised Average Indexed Monthly Earnings amount and, consequently, cause recomputation of the PIA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Earnings in the year an employee becomes entitled to an age annuity or becomes disabled.</E> Earnings in the year an employee becomes entitled to an age annuity or becomes disabled are not used in the initial computation of the PIA. However, the Board does consider those earnings in a recomputation of the PIA and begins paying the higher benefits at the time described in paragraph (b) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="438"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Earnings not reported in time to use them in the computation of the PIA.</E> Because of the way reports of earnings are made, the earnings an employee has in the year before he or she becomes entitled to an annuity, becomes disabled, or dies, might not be reported in time to use them in computing the PIA. The Board recomputes the PIA with the new earnings information and begins paying annuitants the higher benefits based on the additional earnings at the time described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Earnings after entitlement that are used in a recomputation.</E> Earnings for a year after an employee becomes entitled to an annuity are used in a recomputation of a PIA when the earnings are higher than those for a year used in the previous PIA computation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date of recomputation to consider additional earnings.</E> A PIA that is recomputed to include additional earnings becomes payable at the latest of the following times:</P>
              <P>(1) Date the annuity begins.</P>
              <P>(2) January of the year following the year an employee receiving an age annuity attains age 62.</P>
              <P>(3) January of the year following the year an employee becomes disabled.</P>

              <P>(4) January of the year following the year in which the earnings are earned.

When a recomputation is called for due to a change in the reported railroad or social security earnings, the Board processes it automatically. Increased benefits resulting from a recomputation are paid from the earliest month that the recomputation is effective. The annuitant does not have to request a recomputation to consider additional earnings, although the annuitant may request a recomputation before the automatic recomputation is processed. However, the effective date of the recomputation is the same, whether the recomputation is done automatically or at the request of the annuitant.</P>

              <P>An annuitant who meets the conditions for a recomputation may request that his or her PIA be recomputed sooner than it would be recomputed automatically. Providing inclusion of the additional earnings increases the PIA, the Board will recompute the PIA from the earliest permissible date as described in this part.</P>

              <P>If the employee or the employee's family are disadvantaged in any way by a recomputation of a PIA to consider additional earnings, a request can be made to waive or give up the right to the recomputation. Such a request must be in writing and be made by every entitled family member. A request for waiver of a recomputation applies only to that recomputation for which the request is made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Adjustment at age 62 when employee is entitled to an annuity based on 30 years of railroad service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The Tier I PIA of an employee who is entitled to an age annuity based on 30 years of railroad service is adjusted when the employee reaches age 62. The Average Indexed Monthly Earnings on which the PIA is based is adjusted by using the year in which the employee attains age 62 as the eligibility year. This adjustment applies to any employee who attained age 60 or acquired 30 years of railroad service after June 30, 1984. The adjustment affects the tier I of the employee and spouse annuity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date of adjustment.</E> A PIA adjustment based on the employee's attainment of age 62 is effective with the first full month in which the employee is age 62. For purposes of a spouse age annuity tier I, the adjusted PIA is used beginning with the first full month both the employee and spouse are age 62.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employee tier I.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Tier I of an employee annuity is an amount similar to the social security benefit the employee would receive based on combined railroad and social security earnings. The tier I benefit is computed as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) A tier I PIA is computed based on combined railroad and social security earnings, as shown in § 225.11 of this chapter. This PIA is adjusted for any delayed retirement credits or cost-of-living increases, as shown in subparts D and E of part 225 of this chapter, and is reduced for receipt of a pension <PRTPAGE P="441"/>based upon non-covered service in accordance with section 215(a)(7) of the Social Security Act. The tier I of a disability annuity may also be adjusted for other benefits based on disability, as shown in §§ 226.70-226.74 of this part. Except in the case of an employee who retires at age 60 with 30 years of service, if the result is not a multiple of $1, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1. In the case of an employee who retires with an age reduced annuity based upon 30 years of service (see § 216.31 of this chapter) the tier I is not rounded until all reductions have been made.</P>
              <P>(b) If the employee is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see § 216.31 of this chapter), the rate from paragraph (a) of this section is multiplied by a fraction for each month the employee is under retirement age on the annuity beginning date. The result is subtracted from the rate in paragraph (a) of this section. At present the fraction is <FR>5/9</FR> of 1% (or <FR>1/180</FR>). If the employee retires before age 62 with at least 30 years of service, the employee is deemed age 62 for age reduction purposes and a 20% reduction is applied. This reduction remains in effect until the first full month throughout which the employee is age 62, at which time the tier I is recomputed to reflect interim increases in the national wage levels and the age reduction factor is recomputed, if necessary, in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(c) The amount from paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is reduced by the amount of any monthly benefit payable to the employee under title II of the Social Security Act, including any social security benefit payable under a totalization agreement between the Social Security Administration and another country. The social security benefit used to reduce the tier I may be an age or disability benefit on the employee's own earnings record, a benefit based on the earnings record of another person, or the total of two types of benefits. The amount of the social security benefit used to reduce tier I is before any deduction for excess earnings. It is after any reduction for other benefits based on disability. The result cannot be less than zero.</P>

              <P>(d) The tier I is subject to automatic annual increases as provided for in subpart E of part 225 of this chapter.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>An employee born on November 3, 1919, becomes entitled to an age annuity effective October 1, 1982. Retirement age for individuals born in 1919 is age 65. He has less than 30 years of service. His tier I PIA Is $712.60, which is rounded down to $712. Since the employee is 25 months under age 65 when his annuity begins, $712 is multiplied by <FR>25/180</FR> (<FR>1/180</FR> for each month under age 65), to produce an age reduction of $98.89, and a tier I rate after age reduction of $613.11. The employee is also entitled to a social security benefit of $190 a month. The employee's final tier I rate is $423.11.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employee tier II.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The tier II of an employee annuity is based only on railroad service. For annuities awarded after September 1981, the tier II benefit is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) The product obtained by multiplying the employee's creditable years of service by the average monthly compensation, determined as shown in subpart E of this part, is multiplied by seven-tenths of 1 percent (.007).</P>
              <P>(b) If the employee is entitled to a vested dual benefit (see § 226.12 of this part), the result from paragraph (a) of this section is reduced by 25 percent of the vested dual benefit amount. This reduction is made before reduction of the tier II benefit for age. The result cannot be less than zero.</P>
              <P>(c) If the railroad retirement family maximum applies, as shown in §§ 226.50-226.52 of this part, the amount from paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is reduced by the smaller of—</P>
              <P>(1) The difference between the total railroad retirement maximum reduction amount and the reductions in the spouse and supplemental annuities; or</P>
              <P>(2) The total tier II amount from paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) If the employee is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see § 216.31 of this chapter), the rate from paragraph (a) through (c) of this section is reduced in the same manner as the tier I as provided for in § 226.10 of this part. In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see § 216.31 of this chapter), the age reduction only applies to the <PRTPAGE P="442"/>tier I component; no age reduction applies to the tier II component.</P>
              <P>(e) The total tier II amount (paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section), is increased by 32.5 percent of the percentage increase in the cost-of-living increase to the tier I annuity component. Each cost-of-living increase is paid only to an employee whose annuity begins on or before the effective date of the increase. The increases are effective on the same date as any cost-of-living increase to the tier I annuity component.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employee vested dual benefit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An employee vested dual benefit is payable, in addition to tiers I and II, to an employee who meets one of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Employee worked in the railroad industry in 1974.</E> An employee who worked for a railroad in 1974 and retired after 1974 is considered vested if on December 31, 1974, he or she had both 10 years of railroad service and sufficient quarters of coverage under the Social Security Act to qualify for a social security benefit. An employee qualified on this basis is eligible for vested dual benefit amounts computed on his or her railroad and social security credits through December 31, 1974.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Employee who did not work for a railroad in 1974.</E> An employee who did not work in the railroad industry in 1974, but who had 25 or more years of railroad service before 1975 or a current connection with the railroad industry on December 31, 1974, as defined in part 216 of this chapter, or a current connection when he or she retired, is also considered vested under the same conditions as an employee who had worked in the railroad industry in 1974.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">An employee who completed 10 years or more years of railroad service (but less than 25) before 1975 but left the industry before 1975 and did not have a current connection on December 31, 1974 or when he or she retired.</E> Such an employee is considered vested only if he or she had sufficient social security quarters of coverage to qualify for a social security retirement benefit as of the end of the year prior to 1975 in which he or she left the railroad industry. The vested dual benefit amount is based only on credits acquired through the last year of pre-1975 railroad service instead of through December 31, 1974.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation.</E> The employee vested dual benefit is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The combined earnings dual benefit PIA is subtracted from the total of the railroad earnings dual benefit PIA and the social security earnings dual benefit PIA (see part 225 of this chapter for an explanation of these PIA's).</P>
              <P>(2) The result from paragraph (b)(l) of this section is adjusted for any applicable cost-of-living increase, as shown in § 226.13 of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) If the employee is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see § 216.1 of this chapter), the rate from paragraph (b)(2) of this section is reduced in the same manner as the tier I as provided for in § 226.10 of this part. In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is entitled to an annuity reduced for age, the age reduction applies only to the tier I component; no age reduction applies to the vested dual benefit.</P>

              <P>(4) The vested dual benefit payable in a given year may also be reduced for insufficient funding as shown in part 233 of this chapter.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>An employee born on November 3, 1919, becomes entitled to an annuity including a vested dual benefit on October 1, 1982. His combined earnings dual benefit PIA is $254.90, his railroad earnings dual benefit PIA is $93.80, and his social security earnings dual benefit PIA is $244.70. The vested dual benefit before cost-of-living increase is $83.60 ($93.80 + $244.70 −$254.90 = $83.60). A cost-of-living increase of $67.72 (81 percent of $83.60. See § 226.13 of this part) results in a vested dual benefit of $151.32. Retirement age for a person born in 1919 is age 65. Since the employee is 25 months under age 65 when the annuity begins, $151.32 is multiplied by 25/180, to produce an age reduction of $21.02 and a vested dual benefit rate after age reduction of $130.30.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cost-of-living increase in employee vested dual benefit.</SUBJECT>

              <P>If the employee's annuity begins June 1, 1975 or later, a cost-of-living increase is added to the total vested dual benefit amount.

              <SUBJECT>Spouse or divorced spouse tier I.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The tier I of a spouse or divorced spouse annuity is an amount similar to the social security benefit the spouse or divorced spouse would receive based on the employee's combined railroad and social security earnings. In the case of an employee who retires before age 62 with 30 years of service, the spouse tier I is simply 50% of the employee tier I until the first month throughout which both the employee and spouse are age 62 at which time the tier I is an amount similar to the social security benefit on the employee's combined railroad and social security earnings.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction for other disability benefits.</E> The spouse or divorced spouse tier I may be adjusted for other disability benefits received by a disabled employee, as shown in §§ 226.70-226.74 of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reduction for government pension.</E> The amount in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any government pension payable on the spouse's or divorced spouse's earnings record, as described in § 226.31 of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Rounding.</E> The last tier I rate from paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, if not a multiple of $1, is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1. However, in cases in which the spouse is in receipt of an age reduced 60/30 annuity or in which the employee with 30 years of service began a disability annuity July 1, 1984, or later, the spouse tier I is not rounded until all reductions have been made. See § 226.10(a).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Age reduction.</E> If the spouse or divorced spouse is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see §§ 216.51 and 216.52 of this chapter), the rounded tier I rate from paragraph (d) of this section is multiplied by a fraction for each month the spouse or divorced spouse is under retirement age on the date the annuity begins. The result is subtracted from the rate from paragraph (d) of this section. At present the fraction is <FR>25/36</FR> of 1% (or 1/144). In the case of an employee with 30 years of service who is awarded a disability annuity on July 1, 1984, or later, where the spouse does not have a child of the employee under age 18 in care, the spouse tier I is reduced for each month the spouse is under retirement age on the date the spouse annuity begins. If the spouse is age 60 or 61, he or she is deemed to be age 62 for purposes of the age reduction. The age reduction is applied before reduction for a government pension.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reduction for social security benefit.</E> The previous tier I rate, from paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, is reduced by the amount of any monthly benefit payable to the spouse or divorced spouse under title II of the Social Security Act. The social security benefit used to reduce tier I may be an age or disability benefit on the spouse's <PRTPAGE P="444"/>or divorced spouse's own earnings record, a benefit based on the earnings record of another person, or the total of two types of benefits. The result cannot be less than zero.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reduction for employee annuity.</E> If the spouse or divorced spouse is entitled to an employee annuity on his or her own wage record, the spouse or divorced spouse tier I is reduced for the spouse's own employee annuity as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Spouse.</E> If either the employee or the spouse had some railroad service before 1975, the previous tier I rate from paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, whichever applies, is reduced (but not below zero) by the spouse's own employee tier I rate, as computed under § 226.10 of this part. If both the employee and spouse began railroad service after 1974, the spouse's total annuity rate, as shown in § 226.33, is reduced (but not below zero) by the spouse's own employee total annuity rate, as shown in § 226.14. These reductions are effective from the later of the date the employee or spouse annuity begins.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Divorced spouse.</E> The previous tier I rate from paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, whichever applies, is reduced (but not below zero) by the divorced spouse's own employee total annuity rate as shown in § 226.14.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>The computation of the spouse tier I may be illustrated as follows: A railroad employee's wife who was born on September 16, 1920, becomes entitled to a spouse annuity on October 1, 1982. She is also entitled to a social security benefit of $190 a month effective October 1, 1982. Her husband's employee tier I PIA is $712.60. The spouse tier I is $356.30 (50 percent of $712.60). This is rounded down to $356. Since she is 35 months under age 65, the present retirement age when the annuity begins, $356 is multiplied by 35/144, to produce an age reduction of $86.53 and a tier I rate after age reduction of $269.47. Her final tier I rate effective October 1, 1982, after reduction for social security benefits, is $79.47 ($269.47 −$190.00).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reduction for public pension.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The tier I annuity component of a spouse/divorced spouse annuity, as described in the preceding sections of this part, is reduced if the spouse/divorced spouse is in receipt of a public pension.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When reduction is required.</E> Unless the spouse or divorced spouse annuity meets one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of this section, the tier I annuity component is reduced each month the annuitant is receiving a monthly pension from a Federal, state, or local government agency (government pension), but excluding a pension paid by a government of a foreign country, for which he or she was employed in work not covered by social security on the last day of such employment. For purposes of this section, Federal government employees are not considered to be covered by social security if they are covered for Medicare but are not otherwise covered by social security.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment in a lump sum.</E> If the government pension is not paid monthly or is paid in a lump-sum payment, the Board will determine how much the pension would be if it were paid monthly and then reduce the monthly railroad retirement annuity accordingly. The number of years covered by a lump-sum payment and thus the period when the annuity will be reduced, will generally be clear from the pension plan. If one of the alternatives to a lump-sum payment is a life annuity, and the amount of the monthly benefit for the life annuity can be determined, the reduction will be based on that monthly benefit amount. Where the period or the equivalent monthly pension benefit is not clear, it may be necessary for the Board to determine the reduction period on an individual basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The reduction does not apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If the annuitant is receiving a government pension based on employment for an interstate instrumentality; or</P>

              <P>(2) If the annuitant receives or is eligible to receive a government pension for one or more months in the period December 1977 through November 1982 and he or she meets the requirements for social security benefits that were applied in January 1977 (even though he or she did not actually claim such benefits nor become entitled to such benefits until a later month). The January 1977 requirements are, for a man, a one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section), and, for a woman <PRTPAGE P="445"/>claiming benefits as a divorced spouse, marriage for at least 20 years to the insured worker. A person is considered eligible for a government pension for any month in which he or she meets all the requirements for payment except that he or she is working or has not applied; or</P>
              <P>(3) If the annuitant was receiving or eligible (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) to receive a government pension for one or more months before July 1983, and he or she meets the one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section). If the annuitant meets the exception in this paragraph but he or she does not meet the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, December 1982 is the earliest month for which the reduction will not affect his benefits; or</P>
              <P>(4) If the annuitant has been eligible for a government pension in a given month except for a requirement which delayed eligibility for such pension until the month following the month in which all other requirements were met, the Board will consider the annuitant to be eligible in that given month for the purpose of meeting one of the exceptions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. If the annuitant meets an exception solely because of this paragraph, his or her benefits will be unreduced for months after November 1984 only.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">The one-half support test.</E> For a man to meet the January 1977 requirement as provided in the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and for a man or a woman to meet the exception in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, he or she must meet a one-half support test. One-half support is defined in part 222 of this chapter. One-half support must be met at one of the following times:</P>
              <P>(1) If the employee upon whose compensation the spouse or divorced spouse annuity is based had a period of disability, as defined in part 220 of this chapter, which did not end before he or she became entitled to an age and service or disability annuity, the spouse/divorced spouse annuitant must have been receiving at least one-half support from the employee either—</P>
              <P>(i) At the beginning of the employee's period of disability; or</P>
              <P>(ii) At the time the employee became entitled to an age and service or disability annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) If the employee upon whose compensation the spouse or divorced spouse annuity is based did not have a period of disability, as defined in part 220 of this chapter, at the time of his or her entitlement, the spouse or divorced spouse annuitant must have been receiving at least one-half support from the employee at the time the employee became entitled to an age and service or disability annuity.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Amount of reduction.</E> (1) If the spouse/divorced spouse annuitant becomes eligible for a government pension after June 1983, the Board will reduce (to zero, if necessary) the tier I annuity component by two-thirds of the amount of the monthly pension. If the amount of the reduction is not a multiple of 10 cents, it will be rounded to the next higher multiple of 10 cents.</P>
              <P>(2) If the spouse/divorced spouse annuitant became eligible for a government pension before July 1983 and he or she did not meet one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will reduce (to zero, if necessary) the tier I component by the full amount of the pension for months before December 1984 and by two-thirds the amount of his or her monthly pension for months after November 1984. If the amount of the reduction is not a multiple of 10 cents, it will be rounded to the next higher multiple of 10 cents.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Spouse tier II.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The spouse tier II benefit is computed as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) The employee's tier II amount as computed under § 226.11 of this part, after any reduction for entitlement to a vested dual benefit but before reduction for the railroad retirement family maximum, is multiplied by 45 percent. The spouse tier II is recomputed if the employee's tier II rate is reduced for entitlement to a vested dual benefit after the beginning date of the spouse annuity.<PRTPAGE P="446"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If tier I of a spouse annuity is reduced for the spouse's employee annuity, as provided for in § 226.30(g) of this part, the reduction is restored in tier II. The restored amount is payable on the effective date of the spouse or the employee tier I benefit, whichever is later. The previous tier II rate is increased by the restored amount, which is determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Initial restored amount.</E> The restored amount is the amount by which the spouse tier I was reduced by reason of receipt of an employee annuity on the date the restored amount is first payable. The restored amount is only payable if either the employee or spouse had railroad service prior to 1975.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Recomputation of restored amount.</E> The restored amount is recomputed if the spouse becomes entitled to a government pension, a social security benefit, or a different type of social security benefit after the date the initial restored amount is effective. The recomputed amount is the amount by which the spouse tier I is reduced by reason of receipt of an employee annuity on the effective date of the entitlement to a government pension or social security benefit.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost-of-living increase in restored amount.</E> If an initial or recomputed restored amount is effective before the effective date of the cost-of-living increase shown in paragraph (e) of this section, the restored amount is multiplied by the percentage increase that applies. The result is added to the restored amount on the effective date of the increase for each year that the increase is payable.</P>
              <P>(c) If the employee's tier II has been reduced pursuant to section 3(g)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act (takeback provision) the spouse tier II is reduced by one half of the “takeback” in the employee tier II.</P>
              <P>(d) If the railroad retirement family maximum applies, as shown in §§ 226.50-226.52 of this part, the spouse tier II rate, as determined in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, is reduced by the smaller of—</P>
              <P>(1) The total railroad retirement maximum reduction amount; or</P>
              <P>(2) The previous spouse tier II rate.</P>
              <P>(e) The tier II rate, from paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, is increased by the same percentage as the employee tier II increase described in § 226.11(e) of this part.</P>

              <P>(f) If the spouse is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see § 216.51 of this chapter), the tier II rate, as determined in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section is reduced in the same manner as the tier I as provided for in § 226.30(e) of this part.

This railroad retirement family maximum amount varies according to the employee's earnings in the ten-year period <PRTPAGE P="447"/>that ends with the year in which his or her annuity begins. If the employee and spouse annuity amounts described in § 226.52 of this part are higher than the maximum from § 226.51 of this part, first the spouse tier II, then the supplemental annuity and, finally, the employee tier II are reduced until the total annuity amount is equal to the maximum or until the spouse tier II and the employee supplemental annuity and tier II have been reduced to zero, whichever comes first. The reduction for the railroad retirement family maximum is first computed from the date the employee's annuity begins. It is recomputed if the employee's tier II rate is reduced for entitlement to a vested dual benefit. It is also recomputed if a workers' compensation or other disability benefit begins or ends, or the employee's tier I benefit or supplemental annuity begins after the beginning date of the regular employee annuity.

In computing the average monthly compensation, the compensation for each year cannot be higher than twelve times the tier II monthly maximum creditable for that year, as described in part 211 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Claim for use of military service.</E> An employee is deemed to have filed a claim for the use of military service and earnings as service and compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act if—</P>
              <P>(1) The employee indicates on the annuity application or another signed statement that he or she has military service;</P>

              <P>(3) The military service is creditable under the Railroad Retirement Act, as shown in part 212 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(4) Using the military service as railroad service and compensation would be to the employee's advantage (the employee and his or her family would receive higher total benefits than if the military service were credited under the Social Security Act).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date for use of military service.</E> Military service can be used as service and compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act starting with the date the annuity begins but no earlier than twelve months before the employee files an application or statement showing that he or she has military service.</P>

              <P>The employee's average monthly compensation is computed by first determining the employee's highest 60 months of railroad compensation (disregarding compensation in excess of the maximum creditable tier II compensation for that year). The total of the highest 60 months is then divided by 60 to determine the average monthly compensation.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Based on yearly compensation.</E> If Board records do not show monthly compensation for a year, the monthly compensation is determined by dividing the total compensation reported for the year by the number of months of service credited to the employee for that year.</P>

The compensation is indexed by multiplying it by the quotient obtained by dividing the average annual wage for the indexing year by the average annual wage for the year being indexed. If the month for which compensation is being indexed is before 1951, the average annual wage for 1951 is used.</P>

Before a recomputed rate can be paid, the employee must stop working in the railroad industry. A recomputed tier I component is payable beginning with January 1 of the year after the year in which the wages or compensation are earned or (provided the employee is age 62 or disabled), in the case of railroad compensation, in the year after the employee stops working in the railroad industry.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Tier I.</E> A recomputation is made if any social security wages or railroad compensation for a year in which the employee returned to work are higher than the earnings for a year included in the previous computation of the tier I PIA, as shown in part 225 of this chapter. The higher earnings are used instead of the lower earnings for the earlier year to determine the average monthly wage or average indexed monthly earnings. Part 225 of this chapter describes how a PIA is recomputed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tier II.</E> The additional service is added to the years of service previously used in computing the tier II rate. The additional compensation is used to recompute the average monthly compensation, if the compensation for a month in which the employee returned to railroad service is higher than the compensation for a month used in the previous computation of the average monthly compensation. The higher monthly compensation is used instead of the lower compensation for a previous month to determine the new average monthly compensation as shown in § 226.62 of this part. The increased years of service and average monthly compensation are used in computing a new tier II rate, as shown in § 226.11 of this part.

                <P>An employee receiving an annuity which began on January 1, 1992, returns to railroad service for 10 months in 1992 and 2 months in 1993. He stops work on February 20, 1993. He has earnings of $34,500.00 in 1992 and $5,200.00 in 1993. His tier II rate effective January 1, 1992, was based on 26 years (312 months) of service and an average monthly compensation of $2,995 ($179,700 ÷ 60). The additional 12 months of service increases the year of service used in computing the tier II rate to 27 (312 months + 12 months = 324 months ÷ 12 = 27). The 1992 earnings of $34,500.00 are used instead of 1987 earnings of $32,700.00. The 1993 earnings are not used because they are lower than the earnings for previous months used in computing the average monthly compensation. The additional $1,800.00 in earnings increases the average monthly compensation to $3,025 ($179,100 + $1,800.00 = $181,500.00 ÷ 60). The initial tier II amount is increased from $545.09 (26 × $2,995 × .007) to $571.73 (27 × $3,025 × .007), effective with the date of annuity reinstatement, March 1, 1993.</P>

            <P>The supplemental annuity rate, before reduction for the railroad retirement family maximum or any private pension, is $23 for an employee's first 25 years of service plus $4 for each added year of service up to 30 years.

            <SUBJECT>Reduction for employer pension.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The supplemental annuity for each month is reduced by the amount of any private pension the employee is receiving for that month based on the contributions of a railroad employer. This reduction is applied to the supplemental annuity amount after any reduction for railroad retirement family maximum. Private pension is explained in § 216.14 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Private pension reduced for supplemental annuity.</E> If the employer reduces the private pension for the employee's entitlement to the supplemental annuity, the reduced pension amount is subtracted from the supplemental annuity. However, the reduction in the supplemental annuity can be no greater than the difference between the supplemental annuity amount, after any reduction for railroad retirement family maximum, and the amount the private pension is reduced for the supplemental annuity. This guarantees that the sum of the reduced supplemental annuity and the reduced employer pension is not less than the amount of the full employer pension.

              <P>The full employer pension is $80. This is reduced by $35 because of the employee's entitlement to a supplemental annuity. The initial supplemental annuity rate is $43.</P>

              <P>The tier I annuity component for these beneficiaries is generally based on the survivor tier I Primary Insurance Amount (PIA).

See part 225 of this chapter. This amount may be further adjusted for certain reductions or deductions as described in §§ 228.15-228.20 of this part and is subject to the family maximum.

              <SUBJECT>Family maximum.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Family maximum defined.</E> Under the Social Security Act, the amount of total monthly benefits that can be paid for any month on one person's earnings record is limited. This limited amount is called the family maximum. The family maximum is based on the survivor tier I PIA (see part 225 of this chapter). Generally, if three or more persons are entitled to benefits, their benefits will be adjusted for the family maximum.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of the family maximum</E>—(1) <E T="03">The employee attains age 62, has a period of disability or dies prior to 1979.</E> The maximum is the amount appearing in column V of the applicable table published each year by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the line on which appears in column IV the primary insurance amount of the insured individual whose compensation is the basis for the benefits payable. Where the total of the survivor benefits exceeds the maximum, the total tier I benefits for each month after 1964 are reduced to the amount appearing in column V. Each survivor's benefit is proportionately reduced, based on the percentage of the PIA used to compute the survivor benefits. However, when any of the persons entitled to benefits on the insured individual's compensation would, except for the limitation described in § 404.353(b) <PRTPAGE P="455"/>of title 20 (dealing with the entitlement to more than one child's benefit), be entitled to a child's annuity on the basis of the compensation of one or more other insured individuals, the total benefits payable may not be reduced to less than the smaller of—</P>
              <P>(i) The sum of the maximum amounts of benefits payable on the basis of the compensation of all such insured individuals, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The last figure in column V of the applicable table published each year by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The “applicable table” refers to the table which is effective for the month the benefit is payable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The employee attains age 62, has a period of disability or dies in 1979.</E> The maximum is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) 150 percent of the first $230 of the individual's primary insurance amount, plus</P>
              <P>(ii) 272 percent of the primary insurance amount over $230 but not over $332, plus</P>
              <P>(iii) 134 percent of the primary insurance amount over $332 but not over $433, plus</P>
              <P>(iv) 175 percent of the primary insurance amount over $433.</P>
              <FP>If the total of this computation is not a multiple of $0.10, it will be rounded to the next lower multiple of $0.10.</FP>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">The employee attains age 62, or has a period of disability or dies after 1979.</E> The maximum is computed as in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, the dollar amounts shown there will be updated each year after 1979 as average earnings rise. This updating is done by first dividing the average of the total wages for the second year before the individual dies or becomes eligible, by the average of the total wages for 1977. The result of that computation is then multiplied by each dollar amount in the formula in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each updated dollar amount will be rounded to the nearer dollar, if the amount is an exact multiple of $0.50 (but not of $1), it will be rounded to the next higher $1. Before November 2 of each calendar year after 1978, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the formula and updated dollar amounts to be used for determining the monthly maximum for the following year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Special minimum PIA.</E> Regardless of the method used to compute the primary insurance amount, if the special minimum primary insurance amount described in § 404.261 to this title is higher, then the family maximum will be based upon the special minimum primary insurance amount.</P>

              <P>(a) If the employee died before attaining age 62 and after 1978 and the widow(er), disabled widow(er), remarried widow(er), or surviving divorced spouse is first eligible after 1984, the Board will compute the tier I annuity amount as if the employee had not died but had reached age 62 in the second year after the indexing year (see § 225.2 of this chapter); <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that if the employee was entitled to a primary insurance amount based on average monthly wages this section is not applicable. The indexing year is never earlier than the second year before the <PRTPAGE P="456"/>year of the employee's death. Except for this limitation it is the earlier of__</P>

              <P>(b) The tier I annuity component is increased if the employee's annuity was increased or would have been increased based on delayed retirement credits (see § 225.36 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(c) The tier I annuity component is reduced if the employee had been entitled to an age reduced annuity, including an annuity based on 30 years of service, which is reduced for age because it began before the employee attained age 62. In this instance, the widow(er)'s, remarried widow(er)'s, or surviving divorced spouse's tier I annuity component after applying any reduction for age is further reduced to the larger of amount the employee would have received as a tier I annuity component if still alive or 82<FR>1/2</FR> percent of his or her primary insurance amount.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reduction for public pension.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The tier I annuity component of a widow(er), remarried widow(er), surviving divorced spouse, or disabled widow(er) annuity, as described in the preceding sections of this part, is reduced if the survivor is in receipt of a public pension.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When reduction is required.</E> Unless the survivor annuitant meets one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of this section, the tier I annuity component is reduced each month the survivor annuitant is receiving a monthly pension from a Federal, State, or local government agency (Government pension) for which he or she was employed in work not covered by social security on the last day of such employment. For purposes of this section, Federal government employees are not considered to be covered by social security if they are covered for Medicare but are not otherwise covered by social security, or if they are covered under social security solely by an election to become subject to the Federal Employees and Retirement System made after December 31, 1987, and have not worked 60 months under that system.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment in a lump sum.</E> If the Government pension is not paid monthly or is paid in a lump-sum payment, the Board will determine how much the pension would be if it were paid monthly. If one of the alternatives to a lump-sum payment is a life annuity, and the amount of the monthly benefit for the life annuity can be determined, the reduction will be based on that monthly benefit amount. Where the period for the equivalent monthly pension benefit is not clear, it may be necessary for the Board to determine the reduction period on an individual case basis.</P>

              <P>(2) If the survivor receives or is eligible to receive a Government pension for one or more months in the period December 1977 through November 1982 and he or she meets the requirements for social security benefits that were applied in January 1977, assuming the employee's earnings had been covered under that Act (even though he or she did not actually claim such benefits or become entitled for such benefits until a later month). The January 1977 requirements are, for a man, a one-half support test (see paragraph (e) of this section), and, for a woman claiming benefits as a surviving divorced spouse, marriage for at least 20 years to the insured worker.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The tier II annuity component is an additional amount payable to a widow(er), disabled widow(er), child, or parent, but not to a surviving divorced spouse or remarried widow(er), and a parent as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, based on the railroad employee's earnings in the railroad industry. Unlike the tier I annuity component it is not reduced for any other social insurance benefit except a railroad retirement annuity. See §§ 228.20-228.23 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of the tier II annuity component (1981 amendment)</E>—(1) <E T="03">Widow(er) or disabled widow(er).</E> The amount of a widow(er)'s or disabled widow(er)'s tier II annuity component is 50 percent of the amount of the employee's tier II which would have been payable in the month in which the widow became entitled had the employee been alive and in receipt of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act at that time.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Parent.</E> The amount of a parent's tier II annuity component is 35 percent of the amount of the employee's tier II annuity component which would have been payable in the month in which the parent became entitled had the employee been alive and in receipt of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act at that time. However, if another survivor is entitled, or potentially entitled, to a tier II annuity component, the parent tier II annuity component is zero.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Child.</E> The amount of each child's tier II annuity component is 15 percent of the employee's tier II annuity component which would have been payable in the month in which the child became entitled had the employee been alive and in receipt of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act at that time.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum tier II survivor annuity components.</E> If the total tier II annuity components payable to survivors is less than 35 percent of the employee's tier II annuity component which would have been payable in the month the survivors became entitled had the employee been alive and in receipt of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act at that time, the individual tier II annuity components computed in paragraph (b) of this section shall be increased proportionally so that the total of all such tier II annuity components equals 35 percent of the employee's tier II annuity component.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum tier II annuity components.</E> If the total tier II survivor annuity components payable to survivors exceeds 80 percent of the employee's tier II annuity component which would <PRTPAGE P="459"/>have been payable in the month the survivors became entitled had the employee been alive and entitled to an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act at that time, the individual tier II annuity components computed in paragraph (b) of this section shall be reduced proportionally so that the total of all such tier II annuity components totals no more than 80 percent of the employee's tier II annuity component.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Age reduction.</E> The tier II annuity component of a widow(er) or disabled widow(er) is subject to reduction by the same age reduction factor as is applicable to the tier I annuity component. See § 228.15 of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Takeback amount.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The 1983 amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act provided that a portion of the cost-of-living increases payable on the tier I annuity component be offset from the amount of the tier II annuity. This amount is the takeback amount. The amount of the takeback and its application depends on the employee and survivor's annuity beginning dates.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The tier II takeback amount for survivors whose annuity beginning date is January 1, 1984 or later is usually the amount of the employee's takeback amount. That amount is equal to 5 percent of the employee's primary insurance amount, less all applicable reductions (net tier I), on November 1, 1983. However, if the employee's annuity was reduced for a social security benefit but the survivor's annuity is not, the takeback amount is the amount the employee's annuity would have been reduced for the takeback if the employee's annuity had not been reduced for a social security benefit. If the employee's annuity had not been tiered or was being paid under the overall minimum, the Board will compute the amount of the tier II takeback that would have been applicable to the employee's annuity.</P>
              <P>(2) The tier II takeback amount for survivors whose annuity beginning date is before January 1, 1984 is equal to 5 percent of the survivor's net tier I annuity component, before deduction on account of work, on November 1, 1983.</P>
              <P>(3) The tier II takeback will be applied in accord with the above paragraphs in any case where the employee died or retired before January 1, 1984. If the employee died or retires after December 31, 1983, or the employee never retired and dies after December 31, 1993, no takeback will be applied to the survivor's annuity.</P>
              <P>(c) No takeback is applied if the survivor tier II annuity amount before the takeback is applied is $10.00 or less and cost-of-living increases have not increased the tier II annuity amount to more than $10.00 (the takeback may never reduce the tier II to an amount less than $10.00).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A restored amount is added to the tier II annuity component of a widow(er)'s annuity whose annuity is reduced for receipt of an employee annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act provided either the employee or the widow(er) had ten years of creditable railroad service prior to January 1, 1975.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount.</E> The amount of the tier II restored amount for a widow(er) is the difference between the amount payable as a widow(er) under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as increased by all annual social security cost-of-living percentage increases from January 1, 1975, until the later of the annuity beginning date of either the employee's annuity or the widow(er)'s annuity and the amount payable to the widow(er) under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 under the rules set forth in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Widower.</E> In order to qualify for an annuity under the 1937 Act and thus for a restored amount, a widower must have been dependent on his spouse for at least 50 percent of his support in the year prior to her death or at the time the spouse's annuity began.</P>

              <P>The Railroad Retirement Act provides that a spouse should receive no less as a widow(er) than he or she received as a spouse. However, if the widow(er) becomes entitled to a social security benefit, thus reducing his or her annuity, the spouse minimum guarantee is payable only to the extent <PRTPAGE P="460"/>that it guarantees the amount that the widow(er) would have received as a spouse had he or she been entitled to a social security benefit in the month preceding the employee's death in an amount equal to the amount of the social security benefit payable at the time the widow(er) first became entitled to the social security benefit.</P>

              <P>The tier II annuity component of a survivor annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act is increased by 32.5 percent of the percentage increase under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act at the same time that any such increase is payable. The amount of the increase is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> annually. The cost-of-living is payable beginning with the benefit payable for the month of December of the year for which the increase is due. The increase is paid in the January payment. In addition, in determining the amount of the tier II component at the time the survivor annuity begins, all cost-of-living increases that were applied or would have been applied after the employee's annuity beginning date or death and prior to the surviving annuity beginning date are taken into consideration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What the social security overall minimum guarantee is.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The social security overall minimum guarantee is the amount of total family benefits which would be paid under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service had been covered by that Act. A 100 percent overall minimum benefit may be paid, as described in § 229.11. A 100 percent overall minimum based on age (age O/M) may be payable when the employee is 62 years old. The age O/M is reduced for age for months in which the O/M is payable before the employee attains retirement age. An overall minimum may also be payable before age 62 based on an employee's disability (DIB O/M). The DIB O/M is not reduced for age.</P>

              <P>Section 3(f)(3) of the 1974 Act guarantees that the total annuities payable to the employee and spouse, including the vested dual benefits but not including a supplemental annuity, will not be less than 100 percent of the total family benefits payable under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service after 1936 were credited as social security earnings. Subpart F describes how the 100 percent overall minimum rate is computed.</P>

              <P>The original employee 100 percent overall minimum amount, before adjustment for age, other family members, or other benefits, is the Overall Minimum PIA, as described in part 225 of this chapter. This is the PIA which would be used under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service had been covered under that Act instead of the Railroad Retirement Act. The Overall Minimum PIA may be recomputed for additional earnings and adjusted for cost-of-living increases. Delayed retirement credits are added to the Overall Minimum PIA as shown in part 225, subpart D of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Family maximum.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Family maximum defined.</E> Under the Social Security Act, the amount of monthly benefits that can be paid for any month on one person's earnings record is limited. This limited amount is called the family maximum. The family maximum used to adjust the social security overall minimum rate is based on the employee's Overall Minimum PIA. The divorced spouse overall minimum is never reduced because of the family maximum.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of the family maximum</E>—(1) <E T="03">The employee attains retirement age prior to 1979.</E> The maximum is the amount appearing in column V of the applicable table published each year by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the line on which appears in column IV the primary insurance amount of the insured individual whose compensation is the basis for the benefits payable. Where the maximum is exceeded, the total tier I benefits for each month after 1964 are reduced to the amount appearing in column V. However, when any of the persons entitled to benefits on the insured individual's compensation would, except for the limitation described in § 404.353(b) of title 20 (dealing with the entitlement to more than one child's benefit), be entitled to a child's annuity on the basis of the compensation of one or more other insured individuals, the total benefits payable may not be reduced to less than the smaller of:</P>
              <P>(i) The sum of the maximum amounts of benefits payable on the basis of the compensation of all such insured individuals, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The last figure in column V of the applicable table published each year by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The “applicable” table refers to the table which is effective for the month the benefit is payable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The employee attains retirement age in 1979.</E> (i) The maximum is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) 150 percent of the first $230 of the individual's primary insurance amount, plus</P>
              <P>(B) 272 percent of the primary insurance amount over $230 but not over $332, plus</P>
              <P>(C) 134 percent of the primary insurance amount over $332 but not over $433, plus</P>
              <P>(D) 175 percent of the primary insurance amount over $433.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the total of this computation is not a multiple of $0.10, it will be rounded to the next lower multiple of $0.10.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">The employee attains retirement age after 1979.</E> The maximum is computed as in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, the dollar amount shown there will be updated each year as average earnings rise. This updating is done by first dividing the average of the total wages (see 20 CFR 404.203(m)) for the second year before the individual dies or becomes eligible, by the average of the total wages for 1977. The result of that computation is then multiplied by each dollar amount in the formula in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each updated dollar amount will be rounded to the nearer dollar, if the amount is an exact multiple of $0.50 (but not of $1), it will be rounded to the next higher $1. Before November 2 of each calendar year after 1978, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the formula and updated dollar amounts to be used for determining the monthly maximum for the following year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Disability family maximum.</E> If an employee's first month of entitlement to the DIB O/M is July 1980 or later, the family maximum is 85 percent of the employee's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings but not less than the employee's Overall Minimum PIA, and no more than 150 percent of the employee's Overall Minimum PIA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reduction for family maximum.</E> The spouse's and child(ren)'s share of the Overall Minimum PIA are reduced if the total benefits are higher than the family maximum amount. These auxiliary shares are adjusted so that they each receive a proportionate share of the family maximum amount over and above the employee benefit. This adjustment is before adjustment for age <PRTPAGE P="467"/>or other benefits. The spouse and child(ren)'s benefits are computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The Overall Minimum PIA is subtracted from the family maximum amount.</P>
              <P>(2) The result from paragraph (d)(1) of this section is divided by the total number of auxiliary beneficiaries (spouse and children).</P>
              <P>(3) If the amount of each benefit from paragraph (d)(2) of this section is not a multiple of $0.10, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $0.10. After determining the beneficiary's share (the amount after reduction for other benefits) the amount is rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1.00, if it is not already a multiple of $1.00.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Combined family maximum.</E> If a child is eligible to be included in the computation of the overall minimum on more than one railroad retirement annuity, a combined family maximum may apply, if it results in higher annuity rates. The combined family maximum is the smaller of:</P>
              <P>(1) The sum of the individual family maximums on each earnings record; or</P>
              <P>(2) 1.75 times the highest primary insurance amount possible in a year using average indexed monthly earnings equal to one-twelfth of the contribution and benefit base for that year. Average indexed monthly earnings and contribution and benefit base are explained in § 229.2 of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) This section may be illustrated by the following examples:</P>
              <P>(1) An employee, age 62, applies for an age and service annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA). His annuity rate is $700. The employee has a son who was disabled for all regular employment prior to his attaining age 18. The RRA does not provide an annuity for a disabled child of a living employee. If the employee had been covered under the Social Security Act he would have received a benefit of $500 (the Overall Minimum PIA) and his child would have received a benefit of $250 (50 percent of $500), which produces a total family benefit of $750. The family maximum is $804.90. Under the O/M guarantee, the employee would receive $750 since it is higher than his annuity rate of $700. Since $750 is less than the family maximum computed for this employee, there is no reduction for the family maximum.</P>
              <P>(2) It is determined that a disabled employee is entitled to a DIB O/M computed as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Increase in family group.</E> If an overall minimum rate is adjusted for the family maximum and an additional family member can be included, the benefits payable to previous auxiliary beneficiaries (spouse and children) are reduced to provide a share for the new family member.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Change in DIB O/M.</E> The amount of the worker's compensation or public disability benefit reduction does not change when there is an increase in the DIB O/M rate because of an amendment or cost of living increase. However, the reduction amount does change if there is a change in the family members included in the DIB O/M. When the number of family members changes and the DIB O/M is still payable, the amount of the reduction is recomputed using the DIB O/M rate, including the changed family group, as if the new family composition had existed when the worker's compensation or public disability benefit reduction first applied. However, this new reduction is not effective until the date of the change of the family group. The worker's compensation or public disability benefit and average current earnings are the same as those used before the change in the family group.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Change in amount of worker's compensation/public disability benefit.</E> The amount of the reduction for worker's compensation or public disability benefit changes when there is a change in the amount of the worker's compensation or public disability benefit. If the worker's compensation or public disability benefit increases, the change in the reduction amount is effective with the month of the increase. If the worker's compensation or public disability benefit decreases, the change in the reduction amount is effective with the month of the decrease, no matter when the notice of the decrease is received.</P>

The redetermined rate is effective with January of the year after the year the redetermination is made.

              <P>(1) The average total wages (including wages that exceed the maximum used in computing social security benefits) of all persons for whom wages were reported to the Secretary of the Treasury for the year before the year or redetermination, divided by the average total wages for 1977 or, if later, the year before the year the reduction was first computed. If the result is not a multiple of $1.00, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.00; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the reduction was first computed before 1978, the average taxable wages reported to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the first quarter of 1977, divided by the average taxable wages for the first quarter of the year before the year the reduction was first computed.

              <P>No annuity shall be paid with respect to any month in which an individual in receipt of any annuity hereunder shall render compensated service to an employer or to the last person by whom he was employed prior to the date on which the annuity began to accrue. Individuals receiving annuities shall report to the Board immediately all such compensated service. No annuity under paragraph 4 or 5 of subsection (a) of this section shall be paid to an individual with respect to any month in which the individual is under age sixty-five and is paid more than $100 in earnings from employment or self-employment of any form: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That for purposes of this paragraph, if a payment in any one calendar month is for accruals in more than one calendar month, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid in each of the months in which accrued to the extent accrued in such month. Any such individual under the age of sixty-five shall report to the Board any such payment of earnings for such employment or self-employment before receipt and acceptance of an annuity for the second month following the month of such payment. A deduction shall be imposed, with respect to any such individual who fails to make such report, in the annuity or annuities otherwise due the individual, in an amount equal to the amount of the annuity for each month in which he is paid such earnings in such employment or self-employment, except that the first deduction imposed pursuant to this sentence shall in no case exceed an amount equal to the amount of the annuity otherwise due for the first month with respect to which the deduction is imposed. If pursuant to the third sentence of this subsection an annuity was not paid to an individual with respect to one or more months in any calendar year, and it is subsequently established that the total amount of such individual's earnings during such year as determined in accordance with that sentence (but exclusive of earnings for services described in the first sentence of this subsection) did not exceed $1,200, the annuity with respect to such month or months, and any deduction imposed by reason of the failure to report earnings for such month or months under the fifth sentence of this subsection, shall then be payable. If the total amount of such individual's earnings during such year (exclusive of earnings for services described in the first sentence of this subsection) is in excess of $1,200, the number of months in such year with respect to which an annuity is not payable by reason of such third and fifth sentences shall not exceed one month for each $100 of such excess, treating <PRTPAGE P="474"/>the last $50 or more of such excess as $100; and if the amount of the annuity has changed during such year, any payments of annuity which become payable solely by reason of the limitation contained in this sentence shall be made first with respect to the month or months for which the annuity is larger.

            <P>On or before August 31 of each fiscal year, the Board shall, in accordance with this section, determine the amount of the reduction, if any that will have to be made in the following fiscal year in the amount of the windfall benefit components of persons entitled to such benefit components under the Railroad Retirement Act. A reduction must be made where it is determined that the balance in the Dual Benefits Payments Account, comprised of such funds as will be available for the payment of windfall benefits in the following fiscal year including the enacted or estimated appropriation to the Account for the next succeeding fiscal year, disregarding any interest which may be earned by the moneys in the Account during the next fiscal year, is less than the estimate of the amount of the windfall benefits that would be payable under the Railroad Retirement Act during such fiscal year if no reduction were to be applicable. The amount of the windfall benefit as determined by the Board and paid to a person under this section shall constitute full and complete payment of the person's windfall component and there shall be no further liability on the part of the Board, the U.S. Government, or any other person or entity for the amount of any reduction imposed.</P>

            <P>The amount of the reduction to be made in the windfall benefit components of annuities shall be determined in the following manner: the balance in the Dual Benefits Payments Account as determined under § 233.1 shall be divided by the amount of the estimated windfall benefits that would be payable for the fiscal year as determined under § 233.1 to obtain a percentage. This percentage of the unreduced windfall benefit component shall be the amount of that component to which persons are entitled under the Railroad Retirement Act.

            <P>If a person is entitled to a retroactive payment for a month or months in an earlier fiscal year, the reduction factor as imposed with respect to the windfall component of the person's annuity, including that portion attributable to an earlier fiscal year, shall be the reduction factor applicable in the year of payment: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the application of the payment year reduction factor would result in a larger payment than would the application of the earlier year reduction factor, the earlier year reduction factor shall be applied. The reduction factor imposed in the case of a replacement payment shall be that reduction factor which was applicable to the original payment. The term “replacement payment” means a payment made to a beneficiary to replace a check which was issued to the beneficiary in an earlier month, but which was not negotiated, and “replacement payment” also means a payment made to the beneficiary for an earlier month in which his or her annuity was not paid for some reason such as lack of a current address.</P>

            <P>The Board shall periodically, but at least quarterly, examine the determinations and calculations made under §§ 233.1 and 233.2, in view of changes which may occur in the estimates used. If, as a result of this examination, the Board determines that the balance in the Dual Benefits Payments Account will be insufficient to pay benefits from that Account for the balance of the fiscal year at the established rate, the Board shall establish a new rate of reduction to be applied to benefits to be paid for the remaining months so that the balance in the Dual Benefits Payments Account will be sufficient to pay benefits for the remainder of the fiscal year. If, as a result of this examination, the Board finds that the balance in the Account is greater than would be required to pay benefits at the then applicable reduction percentage for the remainder of the fiscal year, the Board may, at its discretion, decrease the reduction percentage with respect to benefits to be paid for the remaining months.</P>

              <P>A lump-sum death payment (LSDP) is payable when an employee with ten or more years of railroad service and a current connection with the railroad industry dies and is not survived by an individual who is eligible for a monthly annuity in the month the employee died. The amount of the LSDP and the priority for payment depend upon when the employee acquired his or her 120th month of railroad service. If the employee acquired the 120th month of railroad service after 1974, a 1974 Act lump-sum death payment is payable to the employee's widow(er). If the employee acquired the 120th month of railroad service before 1975, a 1937 Act lump-sum death payment is payable to the employee's widow(er), the funeral home or the payer of the employee's burial expenses. An application for an LSDP must be filed within two years after the employee's death.</P>

              <P>(1) The first day of the calendar year in which the employee both attained age 65 and was completely insured;</P>
              <P>(2) The first day of the calendar year in which the employee died; or</P>
              <P>(3) The first day of the calendar year following the year in which the employee died;</P>
              <P>(4) However, if paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this definition do not occur before January 1, 1975, the closing date is January 1, 1975.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Living with.</E> A widow(er) is considered “living with” the employee at the time of the employee's death, if one of the following conditions applies:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee and spouse were members of the same household;</P>
              <P>(2) The spouse was receiving regular contributions for support from the employee; or</P>

              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Living in the same household.</E> An employee and spouse were “living in the same household” if they lived together as a married couple in the same residence. However, an employee and spouse, who were temporarily living apart, will be considered “living in the same household” if there was intent to share the same residence had the employee not died. The Board will usually assume that a married couple was living apart temporarily, if the separation was caused by circumstances beyond their control, for example, ill health, financial difficulties, service with the Armed Forces, or confinement in a curative, custodial, or penal institution.</P>
              <P>(2) If the employee and spouse were separated solely for medical reasons, the Board will consider them “living in the same household,” even if the separation was likely to be permanent.</P>

              <P>The residual lump-sum (RLS) is the means by which railroad employees and their survivors are guaranteed to receive at least as much in benefits as the employee paid in railroad retirement taxes during the years 1937 through 1974. An RLS payment can be made only if it appears that no other benefits based at least in part on railroad service will be payable under either the Railroad Retirement Act or Social Security Act in the future. The residual is reduced for any retirement benefits that were paid on the basis of the employee's railroad service, and for any survivor benefits based on the employee's earnings already paid by either the Board or the Social Security Administration. A widow(er) or dependent parent can, before attaining age 60, elect to waive future rights to monthly benefits based on the employee's railroad service in order to receive the RLS.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing an election.</E> An election to have the RLS paid must be made on the certification provided by the Board for that purpose, and must contain an irrevocable election to have the RLS paid in lieu of all benefits based on the employee's railroad service to which the widow(er) or parent might otherwise become entitled.

              <P>Under the Railroad Retirement Act certain railroad employees who have received separation or severance payments may be entitled to a lump-sum payment if tier II railroad retirement taxes were deducted from these payments. This part sets forth the conditions for entitlement to the lump-sum payment and explains how the payment is computed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Persons to whom a separation allowance lump-sum payment is payable.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee who has completed 10 years of service at the time of his or her retirement or death and who has received on or after January 1, 1985, a separation allowance or severance payment (see § 210.11 of this chapter) which would have been used to increase his or her tier II benefit, except for the fact that he or she was neither in an employment relation to one or more employers as defined in part 204 of this chapter nor an employee representative (see part 205 of this chapter), shall be entitled to a lump sum in the amount provided for in § 234.58.</P>
              <P>(b) If an employee, otherwise eligible for the lump sum provided for in this section, dies before he or she becomes entitled to a regular annuity or before he or she receives payment of the lump sum, the lump sum is payable to the employee's widow or widower who will not have died before receiving payment. If the employee is not survived by a widow or widower who will not have died before receiving payment, the lump sum is payable to the employee's survivors in the same order of priority as shown for the residual lump-sum (RLS) in § 234.44.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Computation of the separation allowance lump-sum payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The separation allowance lump-sum payment is calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Determine the amount of the compensation due to the receipt of separation or severance pay that could not be considered in the computation of tier II;</P>
              <P>(b) Multiply this amount by the rate or rates of tax imposed by section 3201(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or 1986 on the compensation (tier II tax); and</P>

              <P>(c) The product is the amount of the separation allowance lump-sum payment.
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>

                <P>In January of 1988 an employee with 10 years of railroad service relinquished his seniority rights in order to receive a separation allowance of $20,000, thereby severing his employment relation. This was the only creditable railroad compensation earned by the employee in 1988. Both the employer and employee would have paid their share of railroad retirement taxes on this amount. With respect to the employee tier II tax, the tax <PRTPAGE P="483"/>rate for 1988 was 4.9% under section 3201(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Although the full $20,000 was creditable under the Railroad Retirement Act for tier I benefit computation purposes, only one month's compensation, $2,800, one-twelfth of the annual tier II earnings base of $33,600 for 1988, was creditable for tier II benefit purposes. This is because section 3(i)(4) of the Railroad Retirement Act does not permit crediting of compensation for tier II computation purposes after the employment relation has been severed. Under the lump-sum provision discussed above, the employee in this example would, upon award of his employee annuity, receive a payment of $842.80 ($20,000 minus $2,800, the amount of separation allowance that was creditable, or $17,200 times 4.9%).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Basis and purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Effective January 1, 1975, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (Act) requires the Railroad Retirement Board (Board) to provide for the payment of monthly social security benefit payments on behalf of the Social Security Administration to certain individuals as described in § 235.3 of this part. However, any such individual who was receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration prior to January 1, 1975, will continue to receive benefits from that agency unless he or she becomes eligible for a different type of social security benefit after that date and files a new application with the Social Security Administration for that benefit. Benefits under the new entitlement will be paid by the Board. The Act provides an offset in the railroad retirement benefits of individuals who are also eligible for social security benefits. Because the Board is required to make this offset, the payment of social security benefits by the Board is authorized for the purpose of convenience in the administration of the Act.</P>

            <P>(a) When an individual described in § 235.3 of this part is determined by the Social Security Administration to be entitled to social security benefits, the Social Security Administration certifies such benefits to the Board for payment by the Board. Once social security entitlement is certified to the Board, the Board then certifies the amount of the social security benefit to the Department of the Treasury for payment and makes any necessary adjustments in the individual's railroad retirement benefit.</P>
            <P>(b) The Board has no authority with respect to the adjudication of the benefit to be paid under the Social Security Act. Entitlement to and the computation of such benefits is a matter solely within the jurisdiction of the Social Security Administration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Taxation of benefits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Annuities paid by the Board are subject to Federal income tax in accord with the Internal Revenue Code. The annuity portion equivalent to the amount of the benefit that the person would have actually received under the Social Security Act if railroad service had been creditable under that Act is treated for Federal income tax purposes the same way as a social security benefit. Annuity payments computed under the social security overall minimum provision contained in section 3(f)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act (see § 243.5 of this part) are also treated as social security benefits for Federal income tax purposes. Railroad retirement annuity amounts exceeding social security equivalent payments, vested dual benefits, and supplemental annuities are taxed in the same manner as benefits provided under an employer plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
            <P>(b) Pursuant to section 14 of the Railroad Retirement Act, no annuity or supplemental annuity, in whole or in part, is subject to any tax by any state or any political subdivision thereof.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assignment of a portion of an annuity paid under the social security overall minimum provision.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Section 3(f)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act, the social security overall minimum provision, guarantees that an annuitant will receive, in combined benefits under the Railroad Retirement and Social Security Acts, not less than the amount which would have been paid to the employee and to members of his or her family under the Social Security Act if the employee's railroad service had been creditable under that Act. An annuitant whose annuity is computed under that provision may assign all or any portion of that annuity to any of the members of his or her family who are or who could be included in the computation of the annuity. Any assignment issued pursuant to this section will terminate:</P>
            <P>(a) When revoked by the annuitant by notification to the Board; or</P>
            <P>(b) When the annuity is no longer computed under the social security overall minimum provision.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 243.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Waiver of annuity payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any individual who has been awarded an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act shall have the right to waive such annuity in whole or in part by filing with the Board a statement to that effect signed by him or her.</P>
            <P>(b) Such a waiver shall be effective as of the date specified in the waiver statement, except that if an annuity has been awarded, a waiver shall not be effective before the first day of the month after the month in which the waiver form is received at an office of the Board and shall not be effective as to any annuity payment which has already been made or which cannot be prevented.</P>
            <P>(c) For the period during which a waiver is in effect, no payment of the amount of the annuity waived can ever be made to any person. A waiver of an annuity shall not, however, have any effect on the amount of a spouse's annuity otherwise payable or on a lump sum under section 6(c) of the Act otherwise due, nor shall it serve to make an individual eligible for a lump-sum death benefit under section 6(b) of the Act or any insurance benefit under the Social Security Act on the basis of the wages of the same deceased employee.</P>
            <P>(d) A waiver once made shall continue in effect until the annuitant requests in writing that it be terminated.</P>

            <P>Section 10 of the Railroad Retirement Act provides for the recovery of an overpayment of benefits to an individual. This part explains when an overpayment must be recovered, from whom an overpayment may be recovered, and when recovery of the overpayment may be waived or administrative relief from recovery granted, and circumstances under which the overpayment may be compromised, or circumstances under which recovery of the overpayment may be suspended or terminated.</P>

            <P>Overpayments shall be recovered in all cases except those in which recovery is waived under § 255.10 of this part or administrative relief from recovery is granted under § 255.16 of this part, or where the overpayment is compromised or recovery is terminated or suspended under § 255.18 or § 255.19 of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Persons from whom overpayments may be recovered.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Overpaid individual.</E> The Board may recover an overpayment from the individual to whom the overpayment has been made by any method permitted by this part, or by the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR chapter 2) (Example 1 of this section). If the overpaid individual dies before recovery is completed, then recovery may be effected by recovery from the estate or the heirs of such individual.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Other than overpaid individual.</E> The Board may recover an overpayment from a person other than the overpaid individual if such person is receiving benefits based upon the same record of compensation as the overpaid individual under a statute administered by the Board. In such a case, the Board will ordinarily recover the overpayment by setoff against such benefits as are provided for in § 255.6 of this part (Example 2 of this section). However, the Board may ask for a cash refund of the overpayment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Individual not in the same household.</E> Recovery under paragraph (b) of this section may be made from an individual who was not living in the same household, as defined in part 216 of this chapter, as the overpaid individual at the time of the overpayment, if the individual from whom recovery is to be made either was aware that benefits were being paid incorrectly or benefitted from the overpayment. (Example 3 of this section).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples.</E> This section may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
              <P>An employee receiving a disability annuity returns to work without notifying the Board. The Board discovers that the employee is working and determines that the employee has recovered from his disability and has been overpaid. The Board requests that the employee repay the overpayment by cash refund either in one lump sum or in installment payments. If the employee refuses, the Board may refer the debt to a collection agency or the Department of Justice for civil suit or may collect the debt in any other manner permitted by law.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>
              <P>The employee in Example 1 agrees to refund the overpayment by cash installment payments. However, the employee dies before repaying the total amount of the overpayment. At his death the employee's widow, who was living with the employee at the time the overpayment was incurred, becomes entitled to a widow's annuity. The Board may recover the remainder of the overpayment from any benefits due the widow.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (3).</HD>

              <P>C, a child of a deceased employee by his first marriage, is receiving a disability annuity on the employee's record of compensation. W, the employee's second wife, is receiving a widow's annuity on the <PRTPAGE P="487"/>employee's record of compensation. C lives with his mother, the employee's first wife. C marries without notifying the Board. Marriage terminates a child's annuity. W is not aware of C's marriage. Upon discovery of C's marriage, the Board demands that C refund the overpaid annuities; C refuses. Even though W is receiving an annuity based upon the same record of compensation as that of C, the Board will not recover the overpayment from W because she is not in the same household as C, was not aware of the incorrect benefits paid, and did not benefit from them.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recovery by cash payment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Board shall have the right to require that an overpayment to an individual be immediately and fully repaid in cash by that individual. However, if the Board determines that the individual is financially unable to pay the amount of the indebtedness in a lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, found in 4 CFR chapter 2. These standards provide that whenever possible installment payments should be sufficient in amounts and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than 3 years.</P>

            <P>An overpayment may be recovered by setoff from any subsequent payment determined to be payable under any statute administered by the Board to the individual who received the overpayment. An overpayment may be recovered from someone other than the overpaid individual by setoff from a subsequent payment determined to be payable to that other individual on the basis of the same record of compensation as that of the overpaid individual.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recovery by deduction in computation of death benefit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In computing the residual lump sum provided for in part 234, subpart D, of this chapter, the Board shall include in the benefits to be deducted from the applicable percentages of the aggregate compensation provided for in that part all overpayments, whether waived under § 255.10 of this part or otherwise not recovered, that were paid to the employee or to his or her spouse or to his or her survivors with respect to the employee's employment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recovery by adjustment in connection with subsequent payments.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Recovery of an overpayment may be made by permanently reducing the amount of any annuity payable to the individual or individuals from whom recovery is sought. This method of recovery is called an actuarial adjustment of the annuity. The Board cannot require any individual to take an actuarial adjustment in order to recover an overpayment nor is an actuarial adjustment available as a matter of right. An actuarial adjustment becomes effective and the debt is considered recovered when, in the case of an individual paid by electronic funds transfer, the first annuity payment reflecting the annuity rate after actuarial adjustment is deposited to the account of the overpaid individual, or, in the case of an individual paid by check, the first annuity check reflecting the annuity rate after actuarial adjustment is negotiated.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>An annuitant agrees to recovery of a $5,000 overpayment by actuarial adjustment. However, the annuitant dies before negotiating the first annuity check reflecting the actuarially-reduced rate. The $5,000 is not considered recovered. If the annuitant had negotiated the check before he died, the $5,000 would be considered fully recovered.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(b) In calculating any adjustment under this section, beginning with the first day of January after the tables and long-term or ultimate interest rate go into effect under section 15(g) of the Railroad Retirement Act (the triennial evaluation), the Board shall use those tables and long-term or ultimate interest rate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Individual enrolled under supplementary medical insurance plan.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Where recovery of the overpayment is by setoff as provided for in § 255.6 of this part, and where recovery of the overpayment by such means will be accomplished within a period of 5 months, and the individual from whom recovery is sought is an enrollee under Part B of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled), an amount of such individual's monthly benefit which is equal to his <PRTPAGE P="488"/>or her obligation for supplementary medical insurance premiums will be applied toward payment of such premiums, and the balance of the monthly benefit will be applied toward recovery of the overpayment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waiver of recovery.</SUBJECT>
            <P>There shall be no recovery from any person in any case where more than the correct amount of annuities or other benefits has been paid to an individual or where payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto if in the judgment of the Board:</P>
            <P>(a) The overpaid individual is without fault, and</P>
            <P>(b) Recovery would be contrary to the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act or would be against equity or good conscience.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 255.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fault.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before recovery of an overpayment may be waived, it must be determined that the overpaid individual was without fault in causing the overpayment. If recovery is sought from other than the overpaid individual but the overpaid individual was not without fault, then waiver is not available. However, see § 255.16 of this part for provisions as to when administrative relief from recovery may be granted in such circumstances.</P>
            <P>(b) Fault means a defect of judgment or conduct arising from inattention or bad faith. Judgment or conduct is defective when it deviates from a standard of reasonable care taken to comply with the entitlement provisions of this chapter. Conduct includes both action and inaction. Unlike fraud, fault does not require a deliberate intent to deceive.</P>

            <P>(c) Whether an individual is at fault in causing an overpayment generally depends on all circumstances surrounding the overpayment. Among the factors the Board will consider are: the ability of the overpaid individual to understand the reporting requirements of the Railroad Retirement Act or to realize that he or she is being overpaid (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> age, education, comprehension, physical and mental condition); the particular cause of non-entitlement to benefits; and the number of instances in which the individual may have made erroneous statements.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Circumstances in which the Board will find an individual at fault include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Failure to furnish to the Railroad Retirement Board information which the individual knew or should have known to be material;</P>
            <P>(ii) An incorrect statement made by the individual which he or she knew or should have known was incorrect (including furnishing an opinion or conclusion when asked for facts); and</P>
            <P>(iii) Failure to return a payment which the individual knew or should have known was incorrect.</P>
            <P>(2) Where any of the circumstances listed in paragraph (d)(1) are found to have occurred, the individual shall be presumed to be not without fault. This presumption may be rebutted, but the burden of presenting evidence to rebut the presumption is on the individual.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i), furnishing information to the Social Security Administration or any other agency shall not be considered to constitute furnishing information to the Railroad Retirement Board.</P>
            <P>(4) For purposes of this section, an error on the part of the agency shall not extinguish fault on the part of the individual.</P>
            <P>(e) Circumstances in which the Board will find an individual not at fault include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) The overpayment is the result of Board error of which the overpaid individual was not aware and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware (Example 1 of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) The overpayment is the result of an adjustment to the overpaid individual's annuity because of entitlement of another individual to an annuity on the same record of compensation as that of the overpaid individual (Example 2 of this section).</P>

            <P>(3) The overpayment is the result of the Board's continuing to pay an individual after he or she has notified the Board of an event which caused or should have caused a reduction in his or her benefit; provided that continued payment of the unreduced benefit led the individual to believe in good faith that he or she was entitled to the payments subsequently received.<PRTPAGE P="489"/>
            </P>

            <P>(f) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
              <P>The Board makes a mathematical error in the computation of an employee's annuity, thus giving the employee a higher rate than he or she is entitled to but which is sufficiently close to the estimated rate given the employee at the time he or she applied for the annuity that the employee believed, in good faith, that the amount was correct. The employee is not at fault in causing the overpayment in this case. The overpayment may be waived if the requirements of § 255.12 or § 255.13 of this part are met.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>
              <P>The widow and four minor children of a railroad employee are receiving benefits from the Board under the family maximum. Another minor child not living in the same household as the above individuals is also determined to be the child of the deceased employee. The widow was not aware of the existence of this child. An award of benefits to this child causes a reduction in benefits to the other individuals under the family maximum benefit provision of the Social Security Act. Because of normal administrative delay this reduction does not take place for a period of 2 months after its effective date. The widow and her children are without fault with respect to this overpayment. The overpayment may be waived if the requirements of § 255.12 or § 255.13 of this part are met.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 255.12</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>When recovery is contrary to the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act is to pay retirement and survivor annuities and other benefits to eligible beneficiaries. It is contrary to the purpose of the Act for an overpayment to be recovered from income and resources which the individual requires to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses. If either income or resources, or a combination thereof, are sufficient to meet such expenses, recovery of an overpayment is not contrary to the purpose of the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this section, income includes any funds which may reasonably be considered available for the individual's use, regardless of source, including inheritance prospects. Income to the individual's spouse or dependents is available to the individual if the spouse or dependent lived with the individual at the time waiver is considered. Types of income include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Government benefits, such as Black Lung, Social Security, Workers' Compensation, and Unemployment Compensation benefits;</P>
            <P>(2) Wages and self-employment income;</P>
            <P>(3) Regular incoming payments, such as rent or pensions; and</P>
            <P>(4) Investment income.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of this section, resources may include:</P>
            <P>(1) Liquid assets, such as cash on hand, the value of stocks, bonds, savings accounts, mutual funds and the like;</P>
            <P>(2) Non-liquid assets (except an individual's primary residence) at their fair market value; and</P>
            <P>(3) Accumulated, unpaid Federal benefits.</P>
            <P>(4) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, assets concealed or improperly transferred on and after the date of notification of the overpayment, other than cash expended to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses, shall be included.</P>
            <P>(d) Whether an individual has sufficient income and resources to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses depends not only on the amount of his or her income and resources, but also on whether the expenses are ordinary and necessary. While the level of expenses which is ordinary and necessary may vary among individuals, it must be held at a level reasonable for an individual who is living on a fixed income. The Board will consider the discretionary nature of an expense in determining whether it is reasonable. Ordinary and necessary living expenses include:</P>

            <P>(1) Fixed living expenses such as food and clothing, rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, insurance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> life, accident, and health insurance), taxes, installment payments, etc.;</P>
            <P>(2) Medical, hospital, and other similar expenses;</P>
            <P>(3) Expenses for the support of others for whom the individual is legally responsible; and</P>
            <P>(4) Miscellaneous expenses (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> newspapers, haircuts).<PRTPAGE P="490"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) Where recovery of the full amount of an overpayment would be made from income and resources required to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses, but recovery of a lesser amount would leave income or resources sufficient to meet such expenses, recovery of the lesser amount is not contrary to the purpose of the Act.</P>

            <P>(f) This section may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
              <P>A remarried widow, W, is overpaid $6000 due to receipt of benefits on the wage records of both her late husbands. It has been determined that she is without fault. Her financial disclosure statement reveals monthly income greater than monthly expenses, and assets of $12,000, $10,000 of which is in cash. She claims to be saving these funds for future medical expenses, because she has a progressive disease. While it is not necessarily contrary to the purposes of the Act to recover the overpayment in these circumstances, the legitimate medical expenses associated with the disease must be considered.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>
              <P>A disability annuitant, D, is overpaid $33,000 because of simultaneous entitlement to workers' compensation payments. He is determined to be without fault. He claims he has assumed financial responsibility for his adult child and her children. A claimed expense for which the annuitant has no legal obligation to pay does not make recovery contrary to the purposes of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When recovery is against equity or good conscience.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Recovery is considered to be against equity or good conscience if a person, in reliance on payments made to him or her or on notice that payment would be made, relinquished a significant and valuable right (Example 1 of this section) or changed his or her position to his or her substantial detriment (Example 2 of this section).</P>
            <P>(b) An individual's ability to repay an overpayment is not material to a finding that recovery would be against equity or good conscience but is relevant with respect to the credibility of a claim of detrimental reliance under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(c) This section may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
              <P>After being informed by the Board that he had been credited with sufficient years of railroad service to retire at age 60, an employee quit his railroad job and applied for benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act. He receives benefits for six months when it is discovered that he had insufficient railroad service to retire at age 60 and was not entitled to the benefits he received. His annuity was terminated. Because the employee gave up his seniority rights when he quit his railroad job, he cannot get his job back. It is determined that the employee was not at fault in causing the overpayments. In this situation recovery of the overpayment would be against equity or good conscience because the overpaid individual gave up a valuable right.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2).</HD>
              <P>A widow, having been awarded annuities for herself and her daughter, entered her daughter in a private school. The widow did not have substantial assets and her income, apart from the annuities she received in the amounts payable, would not have been sufficient for her to have undertaken the obligation to send her daughter to private school. In order to pay for the schooling she took out a loan and used the monthly annuities to pay interest and principal on the loan. After the widow and her daughter had received payments for almost a year, the deceased employee was found not to have been insured under the Railroad Retirement Act. Therefore, all payments to the widow and child were erroneous and the annuities were terminated. It is determined that the widow was not at fault in causing the overpayment. Having incurred a financial obligation (the school loan) toward which the benefits had been applied, the widow was in a worse position financially than if she and her daughter had never been entitled to benefits. In this situation, the recovery of the overpayment would be against equity or good conscience.</P>

Consequently, in such a case recovery of an overpayment is not subject to waiver consideration.</P>

            <P>(a) Where the Board seeks to recover an overpayment from someone other than the overpaid individual, as provided for in § 255.4 of this part, and where waiver of recovery, as provided for in § 255.10 of this part, is not available because the overpaid individual was at fault as defined in § 255.11 of this part, the Board may forego recovery of the overpayment where the individual from whom recovery is sought was not at fault in causing the overpayment and where recovery is contrary to the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act as defined in § 255.12 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Application of administrative relief from recovery with respect to a given person from whom recovery may be made shall have no effect on the authority of the Board to recover the overpayment from anyone else from whom recovery may be sought.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1):</HD>
              <P>An employee, through his own fault, causes an overpayment in his annuity. The employee dies before the overpayment can be recovered from him and he leaves no estate. A widow's annuity is payable on the employee's compensation record. The widow was not at fault in causing the overpayment. The Board may recover the remainder of the overpayment by setoff against the widow's annuity. However, it may forego recovery under this section if such recovery would be contrary to the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act as defined in § 255.12 of this part. Since this is not a waiver of the overpayment, the Board is free to recover the overpayment from the widow at a later date, for example, if an accrual of benefits should become payable, or if it determines that such recovery would not be against the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>

The representative payee dies before the overpayment can be recovered from her and she leaves no estate. The Board may not waive the remainder of the overpayment with respect to the child since for purposes of waiver the representative payee is considered the overpaid individual (see § 255.17 of this part) and the overpaid individual was at fault. However, if the child was not at fault in causing the overpayment and recovery would be contrary to the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act as defined in § 255.12 of this part, then the Board may forego recovery of the overpayment from the child's annuity under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recovery of overpayments from a representative payee.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Joint liability.</E> In general, if an overpayment is made to an individual receiving benefits as a representative payee (see part 266 of this chapter) the Board may recover the overpayment from either the representative payee or the beneficiary, or both. If the beneficiary is currently receiving benefits, either in his or her own right or through a representative payee, the Board will generally propose to recover the overpayment by setoff against those benefits as provided for in § 255.6 of this part. If the beneficiary is not currently receiving benefits but the representative payee is receiving benefits, then the Board will generally propose to recover the overpayment by setoff against those benefits.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiver of overpayments.</E> For purposes of § 255.10 of this part (Waiver of recovery), if it is determined that the representative payee was at fault in causing the overpayment there may be no waiver of the overpayment either as to the representative payee or the beneficiary. However, if the beneficiary was not at fault in causing the overpayment he or she may be eligible for administrative relief from recovery under § 255.16 of this part.</P>

Although both M and S know that marriage terminates the child's annuity, neither of them informs the Board of this event. Both M and S are liable for any overpayment caused. Waiver is not available since M would be considered at fault in causing the overpayment. Administrative relief from recovery is not available to S since he would also be considered at fault.</P>

            <P>(a) This section sets forth the principal standards which the Board applies in exercising its authority under 31 U.S.C. 3711 to compromise an overpayment.

            <P>(b) An overpayment may be compromised only if it is in the best interest of the agency. Circumstances and factors to be considered are:</P>
            <P>(1) The overpayment cannot be collected because of the overpaid individual's inability to pay the full amount of the overpayment within a reasonable time;</P>
            <P>(2) The overpaid individual refuses to pay the overpayment in full and it appears that enforced collection procedures will take an inordinate amount of time or that the cost of collecting does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount; or</P>
            <P>(3) There is doubt that the Board could prove its case in court for the full amount claimed because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts or because of the legal issues involved.</P>

In addition the Board may suspend or terminate collection under the Federal Claims Collection Standards set forth in 4 CFR part 104.</P>
            <P>(a) Collection action on a Board claim may be suspended temporarily when the debtor cannot be located and there is reason to believe future collection action may be productive or collection may be effected by offset in the near future.</P>
            <P>(b) Collection action may be terminated when:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor is unable to make any substantial payment;</P>
            <P>(2) The debtor cannot be located and offset is too remote to justify retention of the claim;</P>
            <P>(3) The cost of collection action will exceed the amount recoverable; or</P>

The examiner shall, as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the hearing, mail to each party at the address stated in his or her appearance a free transcript of the record of the proceedings had before the examiner. Thereafter, the examiner shall give all parties participating in the hearing the opportunity to present argument upon both law and facts. Upon conclusion of the proceedings before him or her, the examiner shall prepare a report which, together with the record of the proceedings before him or her, shall be submitted to the Board. The report shall set forth the examiner's findings <PRTPAGE P="494"/>of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations as to decision. The report may also contain such discussion of the question raised, both legal and factual, as the examiner may desire to present to the Board. A copy of the examiner's report shall be served by the examiner upon each party participating in the hearing by mailing such copy to each such party at the address stated in his or her appearance. Each party shall, within 30 days after the date of mailing to him or her of the examiner's report, file with the Board and serve upon other parties by mailing to their addresses as stated in their appearances such exceptions in writing as he or she desires to make to the examiner's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Each exception shall specifically designate the particular findings of fact or conclusions of law to which objection is taken, and shall set forth in detail the grounds for the objection. General exceptions and exceptions not specifically directed to particular findings of fact or conclusions of law will not be considered by the Board. Exceptions to findings of fact shall make specific reference by page numbers to those portions of the record upon which reliance is placed.</P>
            <P>(b) Each party shall have 10 days after receipt of exceptions taken by other parties in which to file with the Board replies to those exceptions. Replies to exceptions to findings of fact shall make specific reference by page number to those portions of the record upon which reliance is placed.</P>
            <P>(c) The Board may, upon the application of a party and for cause shown, extend the time for filing and serving of exceptions or filing of replies thereto. The Board will render its decision upon the record, the examiner's report, and such exceptions and replies thereto as are made.</P>
            <P>(d) The examiner's report shall be advisory only and the Board may, in any case, exercise its right to reject or adopt the examiner's report in whole or in part or adopt such report with modifications. Findings of fact to which no exceptions are taken will, subject only to the power of the Board upon its own consideration to reject or modify, be presumed to be correct.</P>
            <P>(e) The decision of the Board shall be communicated to the parties participating in the hearing within 30 days of the date upon which the decision of the Board is entered upon its records.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of initial decision.</E> (1) In all cases except those described in paragraph (d)(2) through (4) and (6) of this section, written notice of an initial decision shall be mailed by the Board to the claimant, annuitant or payee of an annuity at the individual's last known address within 30 calendar days after such decision is made.

            <P>(viii) That the annuitant or payee has the right to reconsideration of such decision as provided in § 260.3.</P>
            <P>(4) When an initial decision would result in the termination of an annuity for which there are competing claims or as a result of the receipt by the Board of information from a source other than the annuitant or payee of an annuity, written notice of the proposed decision shall be mailed to the annuitant or payee of an annuity at such annuitant's or payee's last known address. Such notice shall inform the annuitant or payee of an annuity:</P>
            <P>(i) Of the reason(s) for the annuity termination;</P>
            <P>(ii) That the annuitant or payee has 30 calendar days from the date of the notice to submit to the Board any information in writing which such annuitant or payee desires to be considered by the Board in its review;</P>

            <P>(iv) That if no information in writing is received within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice, payment of the annuity will cease at the end of that 30-day period; and</P>
            <P>(v) That the annuitant or payee has the right to reconsideration of such decision as provided in § 260.3.</P>

            <P>(ii) They may respond to such information and their response will be considered by the Board provided that it is received by the Board within a reasonable time. When the Board decision in such case is to continue payment of the annuity, the Board shall send notice of such initial decision to each of the competing claimants in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) When an initial decision that an erroneous payment has been made to a beneficiary is made under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, written notice of that decision shall be mailed to the beneficiary or payee of the benefit at such beneficiary's or payee's last known address within 30 calendar days after such decision is made.

Examples of circumstances where good cause may exist include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) A serious illness which prevented the claimant from contacting the Board in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative or other person;</P>
            <P>(2) A death or serious illness in the claimant's immediate family which prevented him or her from filing;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for waiver of recovery of an overpayment and/or for reconsideration of an initial erroneous payment decision.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A beneficiary who has been determined to have received an erroneous payment under § 260.1(a)(7) shall have the right, upon the filing of a timely request in accordance with the requirements of this section, to request waiver of recovery of the erroneous payment and/or reconsideration of the erroneous payment decision. The beneficiary shall have the right to an informal oral hearing on the issue of waiver of recovery and/or reconsideration of the erroneous payment decision, before an employee of the Board designated to conduct such a hearing, prior to commencement of recovery by suspension or reduction of a monthly benefit.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for waiver of recovery and/or reconsideration of an erroneous payment decision and for a personal conference.</E> A request for reconsideration of an erroneous payment decision must be filed in accordance with § 260.3(b) of this part. A request for waiver of recovery of an overpayment decision and for a personal conference under this section shall be in writing and addressed to the field office of the Board set forth in the initial decision letter or to the Debt Recovery Manager and shall be filed within 60 calendar days from the date on which notice of the overpayment decision was sent to the beneficiary. The beneficiary shall state in the request whether he or she elects to have a personal conference. If the beneficiary does not elect to have a personal conference with respect to his or her request for waiver of recovery or for reconsideration of the overpayment decision, he or she may, along with the <PRTPAGE P="500"/>request, submit any evidence and argument which he or she would like to present in support of his or her case.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to further review of an initial overpayment decision.</E> The right to further review of an initial overpayment decision shall be forfeited unless a written request for reconsideration is filed within the time period prescribed in § 260.3(b) of this part (60 days) or good cause, as defined in section 260.3(d) of this part, is shown by the beneficiary for failing to file a timely request for reconsideration. Nothing in this section shall be taken to mean that waiver of recovery will not be considered in these cases where the request for waiver is not filed within 60 days, but action to recover the erroneous payment will not be deferred if such a request is not filed within 60 days. Any amounts recovered prior to the date on which the request for waiver as permitted under the preceding sentence is filed shall not be waived under part 255 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Delay in commencement of recovery of erroneous payment.</E> Where a timely request for waiver or reconsideration is filed as provided in this section, the Board shall not commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or reduction of a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision with respect to such request for waiver or reconsideration has been made and notice thereof mailed to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Impartial review.</E> Upon receipt of a timely request for personal conference under this section, the Board shall promptly arrange for the selection of a Board employee to conduct a personal conference in the case. The employee designated to conduct the personal conference under this section shall not have had any prior involvement with the initial erroneous payment decision and shall conduct the personal conference in a fair and impartial manner. The employee designated to conduct the personal conference under this section shall promptly schedule a time and place for the personal conference and promptly notify the beneficiary of such. If the beneficiary agrees, the personal conference may be conducted by telephone.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Personal conference.</E> The beneficiary shall upon request have the opportunity to review, prior to the personal conference, his or her claim folder and all documents pertinent to the issues raised. A personal conference conducted under this section shall be informal. At the personal conference the beneficiary shall be afforded the following rights:</P>
            <P>(1) To present his or her case orally and to submit evidence, whether through witnesses or documents;</P>
            <P>(2) To cross-examine adverse witnesses who appear at the personal conference; and</P>
            <P>(3) To be represented by counsel or other person.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Preparation of recommended decision.</E> Upon completion of the personal conference the employee who conducts the personal conference shall prepare a summary of the case including a statement of the facts, the employee's findings of fact and law, and a recommended decision.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Timely review.</E> The Board shall make every effort to render a decision with respect to the beneficiary's request for reconsideration of the initial erroneous payment determination and/or waiver of recovery and notify the beneficiary of that decision within 60 days of the date that the request for reconsideration and/or waiver is filed or the date that the summary of the case is received from the employee who conducts the personal conference, whichever is later.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 260.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Appeal from a reconsideration decision.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Every claimant shall have a right to appeal to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals from any reconsideration decision with which he or she disagrees.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal from a reconsideration decision.</E> Appeal from a reconsideration decision shall be made by filing the form prescribed by the Board for such purpose. Such appeal must be filed with the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals within 60 days from the date upon which notice of the reconsideration decision is mailed to the claimant. Any written request stating an intent to appeal which is received within the 60-day period will protect the claimant's right to appeal, provided that the claimant files the appeal form within the later of the 60-day period following the date of the reconsideration decision, or the 30-day period following the date of the letter sending the form to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to review of a reconsideration decision.</E> The right to review of a reconsideration decision shall be forfeited unless an appeal is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in this section. However, when a claimant fails to file an appeal with the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals within the time prescribed in this section, the hearings officer may waive this requirement of timeliness. Such waiver shall only occur in cases where the claimant has made a showing of good cause for failure to file a timely appeal. Good cause for failure to file a timely appeal will be determined by a hearings officer in the manner prescribed in § 260.3(d) of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Delay in the commencement of recovery of erroneous payment.</E> Where a timely appeal seeking waiver of recovery of an erroneous payment has been filed with the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, the Board shall not commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or reduction of a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision with respect to such appeal seeking waiver has been made and notice thereof has been mailed to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Impartial review.</E> Within 30 days after the claimant has filed a proper appeal, the Director of Hearings and Appeals shall appoint a hearings officer to act on the appeal. The Director of Hearings and Appeals may, if the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals' caseload dictates, appoint a qualified Board employee, other than a hearings officer assigned to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, to act as a hearings officer with respect to a case. Such hearings officer shall not have any interest in the parties or in the outcome of the proceedings, shall not have directly participated in the initial decision or the reconsideration decision from which the appeal is made, and shall not have any other interest in the matter which might prevent a fair and impartial decision.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Power of hearings officer to conduct hearings.</E> In the development of appeals, the hearings officer shall have the power to hold hearings, require and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 258 of this chapter, administer oaths, rule on motions, take testimony, and make all necessary investigations.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Evidence presented in support of appeal.</E> (1) The appellant, or his or her representative, shall be afforded full opportunity to present testimony, or written evidence or exhibits upon any controversial question of fact; to examine and cross-examine witnesses; and to present argument in support of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(2) The formal rules of evidence shall not apply; however, the hearings officer may exclude evidence which he or she finds is irrelevant or repetitious. Any evidence excluded by the hearings officer shall be described and that description made part of the record.</P>

            <P>(3) If, in the judgment of the hearings officer, evidence not offered by the appellant is available and is relevant and material to the merits of the claim, the <PRTPAGE P="502"/>hearings officer may obtain such evidence upon his or her own initiative. If new evidence is obtained after an oral hearing, other than evidence submitted by the appellant or his or her representative, the hearings officer shall provide the appellant or his or her representative with a copy of such evidence. In such event, the appellant shall have 30 days to submit rebuttal evidence or argument or to request a supplemental hearing to confront and challenge such new evidence. The appellant may move for an extension of time to submit rebuttal evidence or argument and the hearings officer may grant the motion upon a showing of good cause.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Submission of written argument in lieu of oral hearings.</E> Where the hearings officer finds that no factual issues are presented by an appeal, and the only issues raised by the appellant are issues concerning the application or interpretation of law, the appellant or his or her representative shall be afforded full opportunity to submit written argument in support of the claim but no oral hearing shall be held.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Conduct of an oral hearing.</E> (1) In any case in which an oral hearing is to be held, the hearings officer shall schedule a time and place for the conduct of the hearing. At the discretion of the hearings officer, any hearing required under this part may be held in person, by telephone conference call, or by video teleconferencing as described in § 260.5(1). The hearing shall not be open to the public. The hearings officer shall promptly notify by mail the party or parties to the proceeding as to the time and place for the hearing. The notice shall include a statement of the specific issues involved in the case. The hearings officer shall make every effort to hold the hearing within 150 days after the date the appeal is filed.</P>
            <P>(2) If the appellant objects to the time or place of the hearing, he or she must notify the hearings officer no later than 5 calendar days before the time set for the hearing. The appellant must state the reason for his or her objection. If at all possible, the request should be in writing. The hearings officer will change the time or place of the hearing if he or she finds there is good cause to do so.</P>
            <P>(3) The hearings officer shall rule on any objection timely filed by a party under paragraph (i) of this section and shall notify the party of his or her ruling thereon. The hearings officer may for good cause shown, or upon his or her own motion, reschedule the time and/or place of the hearing. If an individual objects to having a hearing by video teleconferencing, the hearings officer will find the individual's wish not to appear by video teleconferencing to be a good reason for changing the time or place of the scheduled hearing and will reschedule the hearing for a time or place where either a telephone conference call or an in person hearing will be held. The hearings officer may also limit or expand the issues to be resolved at the hearing.</P>
            <P>(4) If neither a party nor his or her representative appears at the time and place scheduled for the hearing, that party shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to an oral hearing unless said party either filed with the hearings officer a notice of objection showing good cause why the hearing should have been rescheduled, which notice was timely filed but not ruled upon, or, within 10 days following the date on which the hearing was scheduled, said party files with the hearings officer a motion to reschedule the hearing showing good cause why neither the party nor his or her representative appeared at the hearing and further showing good cause as to why said party failed to file at the prescribed time any notice of objection to the time and place of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(5) If the hearings officer finds either that a notice of objection was timely filed showing good cause to reschedule the hearing, or that the party has within 10 days following the date of the hearing filed a motion showing good cause for failure to appear and to file a notice of objection, the hearings officer shall reschedule the hearing. If the hearings officer finds that the hearing shall not be rescheduled, he or she shall so notify the party in writing.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Record of evidence considered.</E> The hearings officer will make a record of the material evidence. The record will include the applications, written statements, reports, and other documents <PRTPAGE P="503"/>that were used in making the determination under review and any other additional evidence the appellant or any other party to the hearing presents in writing. If a hearing was held in the appeal, the tape recording of the hearing will be part of the record while the appeal is pending. The hearings officer's decision will be based on the record. The entire record at any time during the pendency of the appeal shall be available for examination by the appellant or by his or her duly authorized representative.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Extension of time to submit evidence.</E> Except where the hearings officer has determined that additional evidence not offered by the appellant at or prior to the hearing is available, the record shall be closed as of the conclusion of the hearing. The appellant may request an extension of time to submit evidence and the hearings officer will grant the request upon a showing of good cause for failure to have submitted the evidence earlier. The extension shall be for a period not exceeding 30 days.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Hearing by telephone or video teleconferencing.</E> As stated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, at the discretion of the hearings officer, any hearing required under this part may be conducted in person, by telephone conference call, or by video teleconferencing. The hearings officer may determine the hearing should be conducted by telephone conference call or video teleconferencing if use of these methods would be more efficient than conducting an in person hearing and the hearings officer does not determine that there is a circumstance in the particular case preventing the use of these methodologies to conduct the hearing.</P>

If the claimant wishes to submit additional evidence or written statements of fact or law, the hearings officer shall make every effort to issue the hearing decision within 45 days after the written statements are received or the additional evidence is received and the period for comment has ended.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Reassignment of case to another hearings officer.</E> If, after a hearing has been held, it is necessary to reassign a case to another hearings officer due to the unavailability of the original hearings officer (e.g., resignation, retirement, illness), the case will be promptly reassigned. The new hearings officer shall make every effort to issue a hearing decision within 30 days after the reassignment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Pre-hearing case review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The hearings officer assigned to a case may, prior to an oral hearing, upon his or her own motion, refer the case back to the office of the Board which issued the initial decision for the purpose of reconsideration of that decision, where the hearings officer finds that:</P>
            <P>(1) Additional evidence pertinent to the resolution of the issues on appeal was submitted by the appellant at the time the appeal was filed, or subsequent thereto; or</P>
            <P>(2) Additional evidence pertinent to the resolution of the issues on appeal is available and should be procured; or</P>
            <P>(3) There is some other indication in the record that the initial decision may be revised in a manner favorable to the appellant.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Referral of case for further review by initial adjudicating unit.</E> Where the hearings officer finds that referral of a case back to the office which issued the initial decision for the purpose of reconsideration of that decision would be warranted, the hearings officer shall give that office the reason for such referral, together with specific directions as to the handling of the case on reconsideration.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reconsideration of case by initial adjudicating unit.</E> The office to which a case is referred shall promptly undertake any additional development required, and shall make a determination as to whether the initial determination may be revised in whole or in part in a manner favorable to the appellant. Upon issuance of its determination, the office in question shall return the case along with a copy of its decision to the hearings officer.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Revision of initial decision in whole or in part.</E> Where the office to which a case is referred determines to revise its initial decision in whole or in part, that office shall notify the appellant of such determination. If the revised determination is wholly favorable to the appellant, he or she shall be notified that the appeal to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals will be dismissed by the hearings officer assigned to the case. If the revised decision is partially favorable to the appellant, the notice shall inform the appellant that the hearings officer will proceed with the portion of the appellant's case not revised in his or her favor, unless the appellant should request dismissal of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Timely conduct of oral hearing.</E> The fact that a case on appeal has been referred back to the office which issued the initial decision in the case shall not delay the conduct of a hearing scheduled with respect to the appeal, unless the appellant agrees to a delay. If it appears that the office to which a case has been referred will not have completed its reconsideration of the case prior to the date of a scheduled hearing on an appeal and the appellant has not agreed to a delay in the conduct of the hearing, the hearings officer shall proceed with the hearing and the handling of the case as though the case had not been referred back to the office.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Final appeal from a decision of the hearings officer.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Every appellant shall have a right to a final appeal to the Railroad Retirement Board from any decision of a hearings officer by which he or she claims to be aggrieved.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal from decision of hearings officer.</E> Final appeal from a decision of a hearings officer shall be made by the execution and filing of the final appeal form prescribed by the Board. Such appeal must be filed with the Board within 60 days from the date upon which notice of the decision of the hearings officer is mailed to the appellant at the last address furnished by him or her. Any written request stating an intent to appeal which is received within the 60-day period will protect the claimant's right to appeal, <E T="03">Provided that</E> the claimant files the appeal form within the later of the 60-day period following the date of the hearing officer's decision, or the 30-day period following the date of the letter sending the form to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Timely filing.</E> The right to further review of a decision of a hearings officer shall be forfeited unless formal final appeal is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in § 260.9(b). However, when a claimant fails to file an appeal before the Board within the <PRTPAGE P="505"/>time prescribed in this section, the Board may waive this requirement if, along with the final appeal form, the appellant in writing requests an extension of time. The request for an extension of time must give the reasons why the final appeal form was not filed within the time limit prescribed in this section. If in the judgment of the Board the reasons given establish that the appellant had good cause for not filing the final appeal form within the time prescribed, the Board will consider the appeal to have been filed in a timely manner. The Board will use the standards found in § 260.3(d) of this chapter in determining if good cause exists.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Delay in the commencement of recovery of erroneous payment.</E> Where a timely appeal seeking waiver of recovery of an erroneous payment has been filed with the three-member Board, the Board shall not commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or reduction of a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision with respect to such appeal seeking waiver has been made and notice thereof has been mailed to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Submission of additional evidence.</E> Upon final appeal to the Board, the appellant shall not have the right to submit additional evidence. However, the Board may grant a request to submit new evidence where new and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available before the decision of the hearings officer was issued. The Board may also obtain new evidence on its own motion. Upon admission of new evidence, the Board, at its discretion, may:</P>
            <P>(1) Vacate the decision of the hearings officer and remand the case to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals for issuance of a new decision. The decision of the hearings officer on remand may be appealed to the Board in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Decision of the Board.</E> The decision of the Board shall be made upon the record of evidence developed by the hearings officer and any additional evidence admitted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The appellant may submit additional argument in writing with the appeal to the Board. The appellant shall have no right to an oral presentation before the Board except where the Board so permits. Such presentation shall be limited in form, subject matter, length, and time as the Board may indicate to the appellant.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Issuance of decision.</E> The Board shall make every effort to issue a decision within 90 days after the later of:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reopening and revising decisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part sets forth the Board's rules governing finality of decisions. After the expiration of the time limits for review as set forth in part 260 of this chapter, decisions of the agency may be reopened and revised under the conditions described in this part, by the bureau, office, or entity that made the earlier decision or by a bureau, office, or other entity at a higher level, which has the claim properly before it.</P>
            <P>(b) A <E T="03">final decision</E> as that term is used in this part means any decision of the type listed in § 260.1 of this chapter where the time limits for review as set forth in part 260 of this chapter or in the Railroad Retirement Act have expired.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reopening</E> a final decision under this part means a conscious determination on the part of the agency to reconsider an otherwise final decision for purposes of revising that decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">New and material evidence</E> as that phrase is used in this part means evidence that may reasonably be expected to affect a final decision, which was unavailable to the agency at the time the decision was made, and which the claimant could not reasonably have been expected to have submitted at that time.</P>

            <P>(4) A claim was denied because of the absence of proof of death of the employee, and the death is later established:</P>
            <P>(i) By reason of an unexplained absence from his or her residence for a period of 7 years; or</P>
            <P>(ii) By location or identification of his or her body;</P>
            <P>(5) The Social Security Administration has awarded duplicate benefits on the same record of compensation;</P>
            <P>(6) The decision was that the claimant did not have an insured status, and compensation has been credited to the employee's record of compensation in accordance with part 211 of this chapter:</P>
            <P>(i) To enter items transferred by the Social Security Administration which were credited under the Social Security Act when they should have been credited to the employee's railroad retirement compensation record; or</P>

            <P>(ii) To correct an error made in the allocation of earnings to an individual which, if properly allocated, would <PRTPAGE P="507"/>have given him or her an insured status at the time of the decision and the evidence of these earnings was in the possession of the Railroad Retirement Board or the Social Security Administration at the time of the decision;</P>
            <P>(7) The decision is wholly or partially unfavorable to a party, but only to correct clerical error or an error that appears on the face of the evidence that was considered when the determination or decision was made;</P>
            <P>(8) The decision found the claimant entitled to an annuity or to a lump sum payment based on the earnings record of a deceased person, and it is later established that:</P>
            <P>(i) The claimant was convicted of a felony or an act in the nature of a felony for intentionally causing that person's death; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If the claimant was subject to the juvenile justice system, he or she was found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have intentionally caused that person's death by committing an act which, if committed by an adult, would have been considered a felony or an act in the nature of a felony;</P>
            <P>(9) The claimant shows that it is to his or her advantage to select a later annuity beginning date and refunds, by cash payment or setoff, past payments applying to the period prior to the later beginning date, subject, however, to the provisions of subpart D of part 217 and § 218.9 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(10) The decision is incorrect because of a failure to apply a reduction, or the proper reduction, to the tier I component of an annuity, but the Board shall apply the reduction only for the months following the month the Board first takes corrective action.</P>
            <P>(d) Revision of the amount or payment of a separation allowance lump sum amount pursuant to section 6(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act is limited to 60 days from the date of notification of the award of the separation allowance lump sum payment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Explanation of representative payment.</E> This part explains the principles and procedures that the Board follows in determining whether to make representative payment and in selecting a representative payee. It also explains the responsibilities that a representative payee has concerning the use of the funds which he or she receives on behalf of an annuitant. A representative payee may be either a person or an organization selected by the Board to receive benefits on behalf of an annuitant. A representative payee will be selected if the Board believes that the interest of an annuitant will be served by representative payment rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, the Board will appoint a representative payee if it determines that the annuitant is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Statutory authority.</E> Section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act provides that every annuitant and claimant shall be conclusively presumed to have been competent until the date on which the Board receives a notice in writing that a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor has been appointed: Provided, however, That despite receiving such notice, the Board may, if it finds the interests of such annuitant or claimant to be served thereby, recognize actions by, conduct transactions with, and make payments to such annuitant or claimant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.</E> (1) In accordance with section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board's policy is that every annuitant has the right to manage his or her own benefits. However, some annuitants due to mental or physical condition or due to their youth may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of an annuitant would be better served if benefit payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the annuitant is a legally competent individual. If the annuitant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.</P>
            <P>(2) If payment is being made directly to an annuitant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the annuitant is 18 years old or older and has not been adjudged legally incompetent, continue to pay the annuitant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recognition by the Board of a person to act in behalf of another.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Regardless of the receipt of written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor who is receiving or claiming benefits or to whom any right or privilege is extended under the law, the Board may, in its discretion, validly recognize actions by and conduct transactions with others acting on behalf of the individual found by the Board to be a minor or to be unable to manage his or her affairs, if the Board finds such actions or transactions to be in the best interest of such individual.</P>

            <P>(b) In the absence of a written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or minor, the Board shall, <PRTPAGE P="510"/>except where special circumstances appear, recognize a person to act on behalf of an individual under the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) When the individual has been adjudged mentally incompetent by a court having jurisdiction to do so;</P>
            <P>(2) When the individual has been committed to a mental institution by a court having jurisdiction to do so;</P>
            <P>(3) When the individual is an inmate of a mental institution;</P>
            <P>(4) When the individual is less than 16 years of age; or</P>
            <P>(5) When the individual is between 16 and 18 years of age and is in the care of another person and does not have the capacity to act on his or her own behalf.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Information considered in determining whether to make representative payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In determining whether to make representative payment, the Board may consider the following information:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Evidence of legal guardianship.</E> Evidence of the appointment of a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor shall be a certified copy of the court's determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical evidence.</E> The Board may use medical evidence, when such is available, to help determine whether an annuitant is capable of managing or directing the management of benefit payments. For example, a statement by a physician or other medical professional based upon his or her recent examination of the annuitant and his or her knowledge of the annuitant's present condition will be used in the Board's determination, if it includes information concerning the nature of the annuitant's illness, the annuitant's chances for recovery and the opinion of the physician or other medical professional as to whether the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other evidence.</E> The Board may also consider statements of relatives, friends, and other people in a position to know and observe the annuitant, which contain information helpful to the Board in deciding whether the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Information considered in selecting a representative payee.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In selecting a representative payee, the Board tries to select the person, agency, organization or institution that will best serve the interest of the annuitant. In making this selection, the Board may consider such factors as the following:</P>

            <P>(a) The relationship of the person to the annuitant, including the type of relationship, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> family or legal guardianship; degree of relationship, if the person is a family member; and the length of association, if a non-family member;</P>
            <P>(b) The amount of interest that the person shows in the annuitant, including the contributions the person makes to the welfare of the annuitant and the contacts and frequency of such contacts with the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(c) Any legal authority the person, agency, organization or institution has to act on behalf of the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(d) Whether the potential payee has custody of the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(e) Whether the potential payee is in a position to know of and look after the needs of the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(f) Verification of the social security account number, name, address, telephone number, place of employment, and main source of income if applicable, accepted as part of any person's application for designation as a representative payee, unless such person's identification has already been established to the satisfaction of the Board;</P>
            <P>(g) Whether an applicant for designation as a representative payee has ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor under the statutes administered by the Board or the Social Security Act, or convicted of a felony under any other Federal or State law; and</P>
            <P>(h) Whether the services of such person as representative payee have previously been terminated, suspended, or declined by the Board or the Social Security Administration for:</P>

            <P>(1) Misuse of the benefits of the annuitant for whom they were intended;<PRTPAGE P="511"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Failure to comply with any provision of or regulation under the Railroad Retirement Act or the Social Security Act; or</P>
            <P>(3) Failure to meet the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(i) Whether the potential payee is a creditor of the annuitant. A creditor who provides goods and services to the annuitant ordinarily may not serve as a representative payee unless such appointment poses no substantial conflict of interest and unless the creditor is:</P>
            <P>(1) A relative who resides with the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(2) A legal guardian or legal representative of the annuitant; or</P>
            <P>(3) A licensed or certified care facility (or owner, administrator or employee thereof) where there annuitant resides.</P>

            <P>As a guide in selecting a representative payee, categories of preferred payees have been established. These preferences are flexible. The primary concern of the Board is to select the payee who will best serve the annuitant's interest. The preferences are:</P>
            <P>(a) For annuitants 18 years old or older, the preference is:</P>
            <P>(1) A legal guardian, spouse, or other relative who has custody of the annuitant or who demonstrates strong concern for the personal welfare of the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(2) A friend who has custody of the annuitant or demonstrates strong concern for the personal welfare of the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(3) A public or nonprofit agency or institution having custody of the annuitant;</P>
            <P>(4) A private institution operated for profit and licensed under State law, which has custody of the annuitant; and</P>

            <P>(5) Persons other than those listed above who are qualified to carry out the responsibilities of a representative payee and who are able and willing to serve as a payee for an annuitant; <E T="03">e.g.,</E> members of community groups or organizations who volunteer to serve as representative payee for an annuitant.</P>
            <P>(b) For annuitants under age 18, the preference is:</P>
            <P>(1) A natural or adoptive parent who has custody of the annuitant, or a legal guardian;</P>
            <P>(2) A natural or adoptive parent who does not have custody of the annuitant, but is contributing toward the annuitant's support and is demonstrating strong concern for the annuitant's well-being;</P>

            <P>(a) A representative payee is accountable for the use of benefits. The Board will require periodic written reports from representative payees. The Board may also, at the Board's option, verify how a representative payee used benefit payments. A representative payee must keep records of what was done with all benefit payments in order to make accounting reports. The Board may ask the following questions:</P>

            <P>(1) The amount of benefit payments on hand at the beginning of the accounting period;<PRTPAGE P="512"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) How the benefit payments were used;</P>

If, however, such payee is a court-appointed fiduciary and, as such, is required to make an annual accounting to the court, a true copy of each such account filed with the court may be submitted in lieu of the accounting form prescribed by the Board. If any representative payee fails to submit the required accounting within a reasonable period of time after it is requested, no further payments shall be made to him or her on behalf of the annuitant unless for good cause shown, the default of the representative payee is excused by the Board, and the required accounting is thereafter submitted.</P>

            <P>(d) Where, pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the Board suspends payments, such suspension shall not exceed a period of 30 days; thereafter, the payments will be made to the annuitant except where the annuitant is an unemancipated minor under age 18 or where in the Board's judgment the interests of the annuitant would not be served by releasing payment to the annuitant.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Advance notice of the determination to make representative payment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a general rule, whenever the Board intends to make representative payment and to name a representative payee, the Board will notify the annuitant or, in the case of an unemancipated minor under age 18, or an individual who is legally incompetent, the individual acting on his or her behalf of the Board's proposed actions. Such notice will tell the person that the Board plans to name a representative payee and who that payee will be. The notice will also ask the person to contact the Board within 15 days of the date of the notice if he or she objects to either proposed action. If he or she objects to either proposed action, the objecting party may—</P>
            <P>(1) Review the evidence upon which the proposed actions will be based; and</P>
            <P>(2) Submit any additional evidence regarding the proposed actions.</P>
            <P>(b) If the objecting party objects to the proposed actions, the Board will review its proposed determinations and consider any additional information provided. The Board will then issue a decision on whether to appoint a representative payee and who that payee will be. If the objecting party is dissatisfied with either determination, he or she may request a reconsideration under part 260 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(c) If the objecting party does not file a timely objection to the proposed actions, the Board will issue a decision on whether to appoint a representative payee and who that payee will be. If the objecting party is dissatisfied with <PRTPAGE P="513"/>either determination, he or she may request a reconsideration under part 260 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) A request for reconsideration or an appeal from a determination under this section under part 260 of this chapter shall not prevent the Board from making payments to a representative payee during the pendency of such reconsideration or appeal.</P>
            <P>(e) The Board's failure or refusal to select an individual as representative payee or the Board's termination of representative payee status with respect to an individual is not subject to a request for reconsideration or an appeal under part 260 of this chapter by such individual.</P>

            <P>(b) A representative payee shall notify the Board of any event that will affect the amount of benefits the annuitant receives or the right of the annuitant to receive benefits.</P>
            <P>(c) A representative payee shall notify the Board of any change in his or her circumstances that would affect performance of the payee responsibilities.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part implements section 419 of Public Law 98-76 (97 Stat. 438), which amended section 14 of the Railroad Retirement Act to provide that, with respect to annuity amounts payable for months beginning with September 1983, the Board must comply with a court decree of divorce, annulment or legal separation, or with the terms of any court-approved property settlement incident to any such decree, which characterizes specified benefits as property subject to distribution. This part also implements section 1003 of Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 1053), which amended section 5 of the Railroad Retirement Act to allow the payment of an employee's tier II benefit component awarded to a former spouse as part of a property distribution incident to a decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation to continue after the employee's death. Garnishment of benefits for alimony or child support is dealt with in part 350 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Benefits subject to this part.</E> Only the following benefits or portions of benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act are subject to this part:</P>
            <P>(1) Employee annuity net tier II benefit component as provided under section 3(b) of the Railroad Retirement Act;</P>
            <P>(2) Employee annuity vested dual benefit component as provided under section 3(h) of the Act;</P>
            <P>(3) Employee annuity increase as provided under section 3(f) of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(4) Supplemental annuities as provided under section 2(b) of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review of documentation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Regularity.</E> The General Counsel or his or her designee shall review the court decree or property settlement to determine that it complies with both the law of the jurisdiction, and with Federal law and these regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount.</E> Ambiguities in the amount to be paid the spouse or former spouse shall be resolved in accord with expressed indications of the court's intent, except that:</P>
            <P>(1) Where the amount is expressed in terms of a dollar figure:</P>
            <P>(i) If the figure exceeds the total benefits which may be allocated under this part, the excess will be disregarded, provided that any future increase in the benefits subject to this part will be prospectively applied to the excess effective with the date of the benefit increase.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the figure is less than the total benefits which may be allocated under this part, only the amount specified will be paid.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the amount is expressed as a fraction, percentage, or ratio:</P>
            <P>(i) The amount specified shall be applied only against benefits subject to this part, irrespective of the wording of the decree or property settlement.</P>
            <P>(ii) When the amount is expressed in terms of a fraction or ratio referring to the length of railroad service, years shall be converted into the equivalent months. If the length of railroad service specified in the decree or property settlement exceeds the number of creditable service months used by the Board to determine the employee's years of service for calculating an annuity, the actual number used by the Board shall be substituted. If the decree understates the actual number of creditable railroad service months, the number of years or months set forth in the decree or property settlement will be used.</P>
            <P>(3) An amount may be expressed in any other fashion only to the extent to which it may be readily ascertained from records maintained by the Board in the regular course of administration of the Act.</P>
            <P>(4) Unless the order expressly provides otherwise, the Board will deduct the amount specified by the order from any annuity paid to the employee, whether the employee has retired based on age or on disability.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The General Counsel or his or her designee shall make reasonable effort to notify the spouse or <PRTPAGE P="518"/>former spouse and the employee of a determination that the decree or property settlement does or does not qualify as a decree or property settlement which will be honored pursuant to this part. This notice will be mailed to the most recent address of each party or representative of each party as shown in the Board's records pertaining to the employee. A copy of the decree or property settlement will be provided to the employee with this notice. The notice must state:</P>
            <P>(1) The rationale for a determination that the decree or property settlement does not comply with this part; or</P>
            <P>(2) The dollar amount or proportion of benefits which will be paid to the spouse or former spouse.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Withholding after notification.</E> (1) Where the General Counsel or his or her designee has notified the spouse or former spouse that a decree or property settlement will be honored under this part, but where the employee is not then entitled to any benefits subject to division under this part, the Director of Retirement Benefits will notate the Board's records to reflect both the amount of benefits awarded to the spouse or former spouse pursuant to the decree or property settlement and his or her current address. Where the employee is currently entitled to benefits subject to this part, and the spouse or former spouse has furnished all additional documentation required, the Director of Retirement Benefits will take action to withhold from the employee's monthly benefit the amount stated in the General Counsel's notice under paragraph (c) of this section that the Board will honor the decree or property settlement.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the employee was not entitled to benefits subject to this part at the time of the notice by the General Counsel that the Board will honor the decree or property settlement, but the employee becomes so entitled at a later time, the Board will attempt to contact the spouse or former spouse at the most recent address shown in the Board's records pertaining to the employee. The notice will inform the spouse or former spouse that an annuity has been awarded, that the spouse or former spouse may, upon submission of all required documentation, receive a portion of the annuity, and that the spouse or former spouse should contact the Board within three months from the date of the notice. The Director of Retirement Benefits will initiate withholding of the amount awarded to the spouse or former spouse from the employee's monthly benefit, and will continue to withhold this amount for three successive months; provided, that an initial annuity payment for a retroactive period shall count as one monthly benefit payment. If after the third month's payment has been withheld the Board has received no response from the spouse or former spouse, the amount withheld from the employee's benefit shall be paid to the employee, and the Board take no further action regarding the decree until the spouse or former spouse contacts the Board.</P>
            <P>(3) Benefits withheld from the employee may not be paid to a spouse or former spouse until the spouse or former spouse has furnished all supporting documentation required pursuant to § 295.3 of this part. The Board shall allow a reasonable time, not to exceed three months from the date of the initial response from the spouse or former spouse, for the submission of all required documentation. If the documentation is not furnished within the time allowed, payment of the amounts withheld shall be made to the employee.</P>
            <P>(4) Any payments made to the employee subsequent to the three-month notice period specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and prior to receipt of a response or required documentation from the spouse or former spouse, shall be considered properly paid to the employee and the Board shall have no further liability to the spouse or former spouse with respect to such amounts.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Employee benefit entitlement.</E> Payments will be made to a spouse or former spouse under this part only if the employee has been awarded an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. Payments to a spouse or former spouse shall be made only for months and from such amounts with respect to <PRTPAGE P="519"/>which an annuity is payable to the employee, and, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, shall be suspended or terminated for any month in which the annuity of the employee is suspended or terminated. No arrearage accrues to the spouse or former spouse with respect to any month for which the annuity of the employee is suspended or reduced as required under the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimum amount.</E> The amount of payment to a spouse or former spouse may not be less than one dollar per month.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prospective payment.</E> Payment to a spouse or former spouse may accrue no earlier than the later of the date of delivery, pursuant to § 295.3 of this part, of a court decree or property settlement which will be honored under this part, or from October 1, 1983. The amount to be paid the spouse or former spouse under this part will not be increased to satisfy an arrearage due from the employee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Payees.</E> Payment of an amount awarded to a spouse or former spouse by a court decree or property settlement will be made only to the spouse or former spouse except where the Board determines that another person shall be recognized to act on behalf of the spouse or former spouse as provided by part 266 of this chapter, relating to incompetence. Payment will not be made to the heirs, legatees, creditors or assignees of a spouse or former spouse, except that where an amount is payable to a spouse or former spouse pursuant to this part, but is unpaid at the death of that spouse or former spouse, the unpaid amount may be paid in accordance with § 234.1 of this chapter, pertaining to employee annuities unpaid at death.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Net amount of benefits.</E> Notwithstanding the terms of the decree or property settlement, the amount of benefits payable to the employee which are subject to this part shall not include:</P>
            <P>(1) Amounts deducted to satisfy a debt due the United States, including any amount withheld to recover erroneous payments under the Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, or any other acts administered by the Board; and</P>
            <P>(2) Benefits which are waived pursuant to § 243.6 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Termination.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section payments to a spouse or former spouse terminate on the earlier of—</P>
            <P>(1) The date on which the employee annuity terminates;</P>
            <P>(2) The date required by the court decree or property settlement or the law of the jurisdiction in which the court decree or property settlement was entered; or</P>
            <P>(3) The last day of the month before the month in which the spouse or former spouse dies.</P>
            <P>(4) If the employee dies on or after August 17, 2007, a former spouse who is receiving a portion of the employee's annuity pursuant to a court decree or property settlement compliant with this part may continue to receive a portion of the employee's tier II benefit component unless the court decree or property settlement requires such payment to terminate upon the death of the employee.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Priority.</E> In the event that the General Counsel receives more than one decree or property settlement from competing parties, benefits shall be available to satisfy the decrees or property settlements on a first come, first served basis governed by the date of receipt by the General Counsel. Conflicting decrees or property settlements received on the same day shall be accorded priority based upon the earliest date upon which the decree or property settlement became final.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disclosure of information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Immunity from process.</E> The provision for the payment of benefits under this part pursuant to a court decree or property settlement shall not be construed to be a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Railroad Retirement Board as an agency of the U.S. Government. The Board may not be joined in a suit for divorce, dissolution, annulment or legal separation, or otherwise subjected to the jurisdiction of any <PRTPAGE P="520"/>state court. Subpoenas, notices of joinder, interrogatories, orders for production of documents, and like state process issued in connection with a suit for divorce, dissolution, annulment or legal separation will be treated as requests for disclosure of information under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for information.</E> A response to a request for information to be used in connection with a suit for divorce, dissolution, annulment or legal separation may be made by the General Counsel or his or her designee, by the Director of Retirement Benefits, or by a contact representative of the Board's field service.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Information available.</E> In the absence of a signed authorization from the employee, a spouse or former spouse who is a party to a suit for divorce, dissolution, annulment or legal separation, or his or her legal representative, may be furnished the amount of benefits the employee is currently receiving. If the employee is not currently entitled to benefits, the Board may furnish the amount of any estimated benefit to which the employee would be entitled if he or she were of retirement age at the time of the request, as reflected by the records of the Board, to the extent it is possible for the Board to compute such amount. The Board shall not be required to furnish the present value of future benefits, the amount of benefits payable at a future date, or any other computations based on statistics or procedures not maintained by the Board in the normal course of administration of the Act.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification.</E> A letter or statement prepared by a Board official in the regular course of duty from the official records of the Board, which refers to the authority of this section and bears his or her signature, shall be a sufficient response for purposes of discharging the responsibilities of the Board under this section. A certification in accordance with this section may be considered a public document for purposes of admissibility as evidence of present or potential benefits under the Act for use in a divorce, dissolution, annulment or legal separation proceeding.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Miscellaneous.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Disbursement cycle.</E> In honoring and complying with a court decree or property settlement, the Board shall not be required to disrupt its normal disbursement cycle, despite any special schedule of accrual or payment of amounts due the spouse or former spouse set forth in the decree or settlement. A decree or settlement received too late to be honored during the disbursement cycle in which it was received shall be honored with respect to the next payment due the employee.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Liability for payments.</E> Neither the Board nor any of its employees shall be liable with respect to any payment made to any individual from moneys due from or payable by the Board pursuant to a court decree or property settlement regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Liability for disclosures.</E> No employee of the Board whose duties include responding to requirements contained in this part shall be subject under any law to any disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability or penalty for, or on account of, any disclosure of information made by such employee in connection with the performance of the employee's duties in making such response.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicable law.</E> For purposes of a proceeding under this part, the Board will apply the law of the jurisdiction in which the court decree or property settlement was issued unless it comes to the attention of the Board that the state of issuance has no contact with the plaintiff or defendant in the action; in which case, the Board may, in its sole discretion, apply the law of any jurisdiction with significant interest in the matter.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Erroneous payments.</E> (1) If a spouse or former spouse receives a payment pursuant to this part from an employee's benefit, and the Board later determines that the employee was not entitled to all or part of those benefits for any month, the amount of the employee's benefits which was paid to the <PRTPAGE P="521"/>spouse or former spouse in excess of the amount which was actually payable shall be an erroneous payment to the spouse or former spouse within the meaning of section 10 of the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Where all documentation required by this part is in the Board's records pertaining to the employee prior to the time the employee annuity is awarded, but where the Board due to clerical oversight fails to withhold the amount awarded by the court order, then the Board shall begin deduction from the employee annuity with the month the error is discovered, and shall pay the amount which should have been withheld pursuant to this part to the spouse or former spouse. The amount paid to the spouse or former spouse representing months for which the amount under the order was not timely withheld shall be an erroneous payment to the employee within the meaning of section 10 of the Railroad Retirement Act. This section shall not apply where the Board has attempted to contact the spouse or former spouse at the time the employee annuity is awarded pursuant to § 295.4(d).</P>

            <P>This part sets forth the base year service and compensation required of an employee to qualify for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act with respect to a benefit year. Under the Act, only employees who satisfy the qualifying conditions of section 3 of the Act may be paid benefits. No provision is made for payment of dependents benefits for an employee's spouse or children. A qualified employee who claims benefits must demonstrate that he or she is eligible for benefits in accordance with the other provisions of the Act and this chapter. However, a qualified employee who is disqualified under any of the provisions of section 4 of the Act does not forfeit his or her status as a qualified employee.</P>

              <E T="03">Benefit year.</E> The term “benefit year” means the 12-month period beginning July 1 of any year and ending June 30 of the next year. If a registration period begins in June and ends in July, the benefit year ending date is deemed to be the last day of such registration period. If an employee is eligible for payment of extended benefits, the benefit year ending date for such employee will be June 30, or the last day of his or her extended benefit period, whichever date is later.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Compensation.</E> The term “compensation” means generally any form of earnings or money remuneration earned on the basis of railroad employment during any month, excluding any amount in excess of the monthly compensation base for that month and also excluding payments of the character described in § 302.4 of this part.</P>

            </MATH>
            <P>For the purpose of this formula, “MCB” is the dollar amount of the monthly compensation base, and “A” is the amount of the Tier I tax base under section 3231(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code for the calendar year for which the monthly compensation base is being computed. If the dollar amount computed under this formula is not a multiple of $5, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $5. If the dollar amount computed is equidistant between two multiples of $5, it shall be rounded up the nearest multiple of $5.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Accelerated benefit year.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility conditions.</E> An employee who is not a qualified employee with respect to the benefit year in effect at the time of his or her application for benefits may be eligible for an “accelerated” benefit year if he or she meets all of the following conditions.</P>
            <P>(1) The employee has 10 or more years of service, as defined in part 210 of this chapter, prior to the beginning of his or her current period of unemployment or sickness;</P>
            <P>(2) The employee has satisfied the qualifying conditions as defined in § 302.3 of this part with respect to the next succeeding benefit year;</P>
            <P>(3) The employee's current period of unemployment or sickness includes at least 14 consecutive days of unemployment or 14 consecutive days of sickness; and</P>
            <P>(4)(i) If the applicant is claiming unemployment benefits, he or she did not voluntarily leave work without good cause or did not voluntarily retire, or</P>
            <P>(ii) If the applicant is claiming sickness benefits, he or she has not attained age 65 or has not voluntarily retired.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Beginning date of benefit year.</E> An accelerated benefit year begins on the first day of the month during which the employee's period of 14 consecutive days of unemployment or 14 consecutive days of sickness begins. Thus, for example, if an eligible employee has 14 consecutive days of unemployment from May 29-June 11, his or her benefit year beginning date is May 1, that is, he or she does not have to wait until July 1 to begin receiving benefits. If such employee also had a claim for the period May 15 to May 28, such claim may then be compensable or may serve as the waiting period even though the claim did not consist of 14 days of unemployment. His or her benefit year ends June 30 of the following year.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of attaining age 65.</E> If a benefit year begins early for the purpose of paying sickness benefits and the employee attains age 65 before July 1 of <PRTPAGE P="525"/>the general benefit year, sickness benefits may not be paid for any day from the day on which the employee attained age 65 up to and including June 30, but unemployment benefits may be paid in this interim period if the employee is otherwise eligible. Sickness benefits may be paid for days of sickness beginning July 1 or later. If a benefit year begins early for the purpose of paying unemployment benefits, attainment of age 65 will have no effect on the employee's rights to sickness benefits, other than extended sickness benefits, in the accelerated benefit year. An employee is deemed to attain age 65 on the day before his or her sixty-fifth birthday.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Publication of base year compensation requirement.</E> On or before December 1 of each year, the Railroad Retirement Board will compute the amount of base year compensation that an employee must have during the following calendar year in order to be a qualified employee on the basis of such compensation. Within 10 days of such computation, the Board will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the amount so computed and will notify each employer of that amount. Information as to such qualifying amount may also be obtained from any district or regional office of the Railroad Retirement Board or from the Bureau of Unemployment and Sickness Insurance.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notices.</E> The Board will provide employers with notices of their employees' rights to benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The Board will arrange with employers to post such notices in such numbers and in such places as may be necessary to ensure that they will be seen by the greatest number of employees.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Employer reports.</E> In determining whether an applicant for benefits is a qualified employee, the Board will rely initially upon reports of base year service and compensation provided by employers in accordance with part 209 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">No employer report located.</E> If the Board cannot locate the employer's report of base year service and compensation for an applicant, the applicant will be afforded an opportunity, by completing the form prescribed by the Board, to provide such other statement, information, evidence or documentation to establish his or her status as a qualified employee. An employee's claim for credit for service or compensation that is not shown in the Board's records of service and compensation shall be verified in accordance with §§ 210.7 and 211.14 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employer fails to report.</E> When an employer has failed or refuses to file a report under part 209 of this chapter, an employee may establish his or her base year service and compensation by submitting:</P>
            <P>(1) Statements, under oath or otherwise, signed by an official or duly authorized employee of a Federal or State governmental agency, based upon reports to the agency by the employer; or</P>
            <P>(2) Statements, under oath or otherwise, signed by an officer or a duly authorized employee of the employer, or if not so signed, on forms prepared by the employer.</P>

              <P>* * * In any case in which benefits are awarded to a claimant in whole or in part upon the basis of pay earned in the service of a person or company found by the Board to be an employer as defined in this Act but which denies that it is such an employer, such benefits awarded on such basis shall be <PRTPAGE P="526"/>paid to such claimant subject to a right of recovery of such benefits. The Board shall thereupon designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and to report to the Board on whether such benefits should be repaid. The Board may also designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and report to the Board whether or not any person or company is entitled to a refund of contributions or should be required to pay contributions under this Act, regardless of whether or not any claims for benefits will have been filed upon the basis of service in the employ of such person or company, and shall follow such procedure if contributions are assessed and payment is refused or payment is made and a refund claimed upon the basis that such person or company is or will not have been liable for such contributions. In any such case the Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing.

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for determining entitlement to benefits awarded where employer status is denied, and for determining liability for contributions.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Board may designate one of its officers or employees as examiner to receive evidence and report to the Board (1) whether or not a claimant should repay benefits awarded in whole or in part upon the basis of pay earned in the service of a person or company found by the Board to be an employer as defined in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, but which denies that it is such an employer, or (2) whether or not any person or company is entitled to a refund of contributions or should be required to pay contributions under the Act. Such procedure shall be followed if contributions are assessed and payment is refused or payment is made and a refund claimed upon the basis that such person or company is or will not have been liable for such contributions. The examiner shall have power to hold hearings, require and compel the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony, and make all necessary investigations. At the request of any party properly interested, the Board shall <PRTPAGE P="527"/>provide for a hearing before such examiner, and may provide for a hearing on its own motion. The examiner shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) All evidence and argument presented by any party, and all evidence developed by the examiner, shall be preserved and shall constitute a part of the record. All oral evidence presented at any hearing, and all oral argument, shall be reduced to writing. The record at any time shall be available for examination by any properly interested party or his representative.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon the completion of any proceeding, the examiner shall upon the basis of the entire record, render a report to the Board as soon as practicable, and within five days after the making thereof shall send a copy of the report to each party appearing in the proceeding by mailing such copy to him at the address stated in his appearance. Such report shall contain a statement of (1) the issue or issues raised, (2) the evidence submitted, (3) findings of fact, (4) conclusions of law, and (5) a recommended determination.</P>
            <P>(d) Any party to the proceeding may, within twenty days after the mailing to him of a copy of the examiner's report, file with the Board, and serve upon other parties by mailing to their addresses as stated in their appearances, such exceptions in writing as he desires to make to the examiner's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Each exception shall specifically designate the particular finding of fact or conclusion of law to which exception is taken, and shall set forth in detail the grounds of the exception. General exceptions and exceptions not specifically directed to particular findings of fact or conclusions of law will not be considered. Each party shall have ten days after the receipt of exceptions taken by other parties in which to file with the Board replies to the exceptions. The Board may, upon the application of any party and for cause shown, extend the time for filing and serving of exceptions or filing of replies thereto. The examiner's report shall be advisory but shall be presumed to be correct. Findings of fact to which no exceptions are taken will, subject only to the power of the Board to reject or modify, stand confirmed.</P>
            <P>(e) The Board will render its decision upon the record and upon the basis of the examiner's report and such exceptions and replies thereto as are made. Further argument will not be permitted except upon a showing by any party that he has arguments to present which for valid reasons he was unable to present at an earlier stage, and in cases in which the Board requests further elaboration of arguments. In such cases, the further argument shall be submitted orally or in writing, as the Board may indicate in each case, and shall be subject to such restrictions as to form, subject matter, length, and time as the Board may indicate. The decision of the Board will be communicated to all parties to the proceeding within fifteen days after it has been made by mailing a copy of the decision to each such party at the address furnished by him.</P>
            <P>(f) The decision of the Board, with respect to all issues determined therein, shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, and shall conclusively establish all rights and obligations, arising under any act administered by the Board, of every person notified of his right to participate in the proceeding.</P>

            <P>(g) Any properly interested party notified of his right to participate in the proceeding may, as provided in section 5(c) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, and in accordance with the provisions of section 5(f) of the Act, obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Board, under this section, by which he claims to be aggrieved, by filing a petition for review in the proper court within ninety days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision, or within such further time as the Board may allow. Such petition for review must be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the party resides or will have had his principal place of business or principal executive office, or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit or in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.<PRTPAGE P="528"/>
            </P>
            <P>(h) Insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the preceding provisions of this section, the provisions of §§ 250.7 to 250.16 of this chapter shall be followed in any proceeding under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Initial determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>An initial determination shall be made with respect to each claim for unemployment or sickness benefits by the appropriate adjudicating office as provided by § 320.6 of this part. Prior to making an initial determination the Board shall provide the claimant's base-year employer(s) and most recent employer if different with notice that a claim has been filed and that the employer(s) has an opportunity to submit information which may be pertinent to the adjudication of the claim. The adjudicating office shall make its determination on the basis of the claimant's application and claim and any relevant information or evidence including any information received from the base-year employer(s). A determination allowing payment of an initial claim shall not establish a presumption that benefits for subsequent claims in the same period of unemployment or sickness are also payable. The Director of Policy and Systems shall issue instructions with respect to the adjudication of claims and initial determination on such claims. If it is found that only part of the benefits claimed may initially be paid, a partial payment shall be made prior to a final decision on the whole claim.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reconsideration of initial determination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request.</E> A claimant shall have the right to request reconsideration of an initial determination under § 320.5 of this part which denies in whole or in part his or her claim for benefits. A claimant shall have the right to request reconsideration of a notice of overpayment under § 320.9 of this part. The base-year employer(s) shall have the right to request reconsideration of an initial determination under § 320.5 of this part which awards in whole or in part a claimant's claim for benefits. A reconsideration request shall be made in writing and addressed to the adjudicating office that issued the initial determination and must be received by the adjudicating office no later than 60 days from the date of the notice of the initial decision. A railroad employer may fulfill the written request requirement by using an electronic system that has been approved by the agency in the manner prescribed by the agency.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of evidence.</E> Upon request, the party requesting reconsideration shall have an opportunity to review all evidence and documents that pertain to the initial determination. The Board shall made all reasonable efforts to protect the identity of the source of adverse evidence.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of decision.</E> The adjudicating office shall, as soon as possible, render a decision on the request for reconsideration. If a decision rendered by a district office, as the adjudicating office, sustains the initial determination, either in whole or in part, the decision shall be referred to the appropriate Field Service-Headquarters staff for review prior to issuance. The party who requested reconsideration shall be notified, in writing, of the decision on reconsideration no later than 15 days from the date of the decision or, where the Field Service-Headquarters staff has conducted a review of the decision, within 7 days following the completion of the review. If the decision results in denial of benefits, the claimant shall be notified of the right to appeal as provided in § 320.12 of this part. If the decision results in payment of benefits, the base-year employer(s) shall be notified of the right to appeal as provided in § 320.12 of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Right to further review of initial determination.</E> The right to further review of a determination made under § 320.5 or § 320.9 of this part shall be forfeited unless a written request for reconsideration is filed within the time period prescribed in this section or good cause <PRTPAGE P="531"/>is shown by the party requesting reconsideration for failing to file a timely request for reconsideration. A railroad employer may fulfill the written request requirement by using an electronic system approved by the agency in the manner prescribed by the agency.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Timely request for reconsideration.</E> In determining whether either the claimant or the base-year employer(s) has good cause for failure to file a timely request for reconsideration, the adjudicating office shall consider the circumstances which kept either the claimant or the base-year employer(s) from filing the request on time and whether any action by the Board misled either of them. Examples of circumstances where good cause may exist include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) A serious illness which prevented the claimant from contacting the Board in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative or other person;</P>
            <P>(2) A death or serious illness in the claimant's immediate family which prevented him or her from filing.</P>
            <P>(3) The destruction of important and relevant records;</P>
            <P>(4) A failure to be notified of a decision;</P>
            <P>(5) The existence of an unusual or unavoidable circumstance which demonstrates that either the claimant or the base-year employer(s) would not have known of the need to file timely or which prevented either of them from filing in a timely manner; or</P>
            <P>(6) The claimant thought that his or her representative had requested reconsideration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for waiver of recovery.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time limitation.</E> The claimant shall have 60 days from the date of the notification of the erroneous payment determination in which to file a request for waiver, except that where an erroneous payment is not subject to waiver in accordance with § 340.10(e) of this chapter, waiver may not be requested and recovery will not be stayed. Such requests shall be made in writing and be filed by mail or in person at any Board office. The claimant shall, along with the request, submit any evidence and argument which he or she would like to present in support of his or her case. A request solely for reconsideration of an overpayment shall not be considered a request for waiver under this section but shall be treated as a request for reconsideration under § 320.10 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Recovery action.</E> Where a claimant has made a timely request for waiver of recovery, no action will be taken to recover the erroneous payment by setoff against current benefits prior to a decision on such request; <E T="03">provided however,</E> That the Board may, prior to a decision, withhold the amount of the erroneous payment from benefit payments under any of the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) The claimant admits he or she was at fault in causing the overpayment;</P>
            <P>(2) The claimant is found to have committed fraud;</P>
            <P>(3) The claimant authorizes recovery by setoff or agrees to repayment; or</P>
            <P>(4) The amount of erroneous payment is not subject to waiver or provided for in § 340.10(e) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of evidence.</E> Upon request, the claimant shall have an opportunity to review all evidence and documents that pertain to the erroneous payment determination.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Decision.</E> The Debt Recovery Manager shall make a decision on the claimant's request for waiver of recovery and shall notify the claimant accordingly. The decision of the Manager shall include the basis of the decision, setting forth his or her reasons for the decision including the impact, if any, of any evidence submitted by the base-year or last employer. If the Manager decides that waiver of recovery is not appropriate, the adjudicating office shall wait 15 days from the date of the notification of the waiver decision before taking any action to recover the erroneous payment. If the Manager decides that recovery should be waived, any amount of the erroneous payment so waived but previously recovered by setoff shall be refunded to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> If the Debt Recovery Manager decides that waiver of recovery is <PRTPAGE P="532"/>not appropriate, the claimant shall have the right to appeal such decision as provided under § 320.12 of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Requests made after 60 days.</E> Nothing in this section shall be taken to mean that waiver of recovery will not be considered in those cases where the request for waiver is not filed within 60 days, but action to recover the erroneous payment will not be deferred if such request is not filed within 60 days, and any amount of the erroneous payment recovered prior to the date on which the request is filed shall not be subject to waiver under part 340 of this chapter. Further, it shall not be considered that a claimant prejudices his or her request for waiver by tendering all or a portion of an erroneous payment or by selecting a particular method of repaying the debt. However, no waiver consideration shall be given to a debt which is settled by compromise.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Evidence provided by base-year employer(s) and most recent employer, if different.</E> In making a decision under paragraph (d) of this section, the Debt Recovery Manager shall consider all evidence of record including any evidence submitted by the claimant's base-year employer(s) and the most recent employer, if different. Where a claimant has requested waiver the Manager shall notify his or her base-year employer(s) and the most recent employer, if different, of the right to submit, within 30 days, any information which may be pertinent to the waiver decision.</P>

Such an appeal shall be made by filing the form prescribed by the Board for such purpose. The appeal must be filed with the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals within 60 days from the date upon which notice of the decision on reconsideration or waiver of recovery was mailed to either a claimant or the base year employer(s). Any written request stating an intent to appeal which is received within the 60-day period will protect the claimant's or base-year employer's right to appeal, <E T="03">Provided that</E> the claimant or base-year employer files the appeal form within the later of the 60-day period from the date of the reconsideration decision, or the 30-day period following the date of the Board's letter sending the appeal form to the claimant or base-year employer.</P>

            <P>(c) Where a timely appeal seeking waiver of recovery of an erroneous payment has been filed with the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, the Board shall not commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or reduction of a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision with respect to such appeal seeking waiver has been made and notice thereof has been mailed to the claimant.</P>

The hearings officer shall inform the base-year employer(s) that such employer(s) shall have a right to be present at any hearing which is to be held under this part and the right to submit evidence with respect to the issues on appeal. Within 30 days of the date of such notice a base-year employer shall provide the hearings officer with a statement in writing which summarizes the evidence which such employer intends to present with respect to the issues on appeal, which indicates whether the employer wishes to be present at any hearing which may be held, and which designates who will represent the employer with respect to the appeal.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ruling on objection.</E> The hearings officer shall rule on any objection timely filed by a party under this section and shall notify the party of his or her ruling thereon. The hearings officer may for good cause shown, or upon his or her own motion, reschedule the time and/or place of the hearing. If an individual objects to having a hearing by video teleconferencing, the hearings officer will find the individual's wish not to appear by video teleconferencing to be a good reason for changing the time or place of the scheduled hearing and will reschedule the hearing for a time or place where a telephone conference call or an in person hearing will be held.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Manner of conducting hearing.</E> The hearing shall be informal, fair, and impartial, and shall be conducted in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties. The hearing shall not be open to the public.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Evidence presented in support of appeal.</E> (1) Any party, or his or her representative, shall be afforded full opportunity to present evidence upon any controversial question of fact, orally or in writing or by means of exhibits; to examine and cross-examine witnesses; and to present argument in support of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(2) The formal rules of evidence shall not apply; however, the hearings officer may exclude evidence which he or she finds is irrelevant or repetitious. Any evidence excluded by the hearings officer shall be described and that description made part of the record.</P>
            <P>(3) If, in the judgment of the hearings officer, evidence not offered is available and is relevant and material to the merits of the claim, the hearings officer may obtain such evidence upon his or her own initiative. If new evidence is obtained after an oral hearing, other than evidence submitted by a party or his representative, the hearings officer shall provide the parties or their representatives with a copy of such evidence. In such event, any party shall have 30 days to submit rebuttal evidence or argument or to request a supplemental hearing to confront and challenge such new evidence. Any party may move for an extension of time to submit rebuttal evidence or argument and the hearings officer may grant the motion upon a showing of good cause.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Where no oral hearing required.</E> Where the hearings officer finds that no factual issues are presented by an appeal, and the only issues raised by the parties are issues concerning the application or interpretation of law, the parties or their representatives shall be afforded full opportunity to submit written argument in support of their position but no oral hearing shall be held.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Hearing by telephone or video teleconferencing.</E> As stated in § 320.22(a), at the discretion of the hearings officer, any hearing required under this part may be conducted in person, by telephone conference call, or by video teleconferencing. The hearings officer may determine the hearing should be conducted by telephone conference call or video teleconferencing if use of these methods would be more efficient than conducting an in person hearing and the hearings officer does not determine that there is a circumstance in the particular case preventing the use of these methodologies to conduct the hearing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Execution and filing of appeal to Board from decision of hearings officer.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) An appeal to the Board from the decision of a hearings officer shall be filed on the form provided by the Board and shall be executed in accordance with the instructions on the form. Such appeal shall be filed within 60 days from the date upon which notice of the decision of the hearings officer was mailed to the parties. The right to further review of a decision of a hearings officer shall be forfeited unless formal final appeal is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in this section. Any written request stating an intent to appeal which is received within the 60-day period will protect the claimant's right to appeal, <E T="03">Provided that</E> the claimant files the appeal form within the later of the 60-day period following the date of the hearing officer's decision, or the 30-day period following the date of the letter sending the appeal form to the claimant. However, when a party fails to file an appeal before the Board within the time <PRTPAGE P="536"/>prescribed in this section, the Board may waive this requirement if along with the final appeal, the party in writing requests an extension of time. The request for an extension of time must give the reasons why the final appeal form was not filed within the time limit prescribed in this section. If in the judgment of the Board the reasons given establish that the party has good cause for not filing the final appeal form within the time limit prescribed, the Board will consider the appeal to have been filed in a timely manner. The Board will use the standards found in § 320.10(e) of this part in determining if good cause exists.</P>
            <P>(b) Where a timely appeal seeking waiver of recovery of an erroneous payment has been filed with the three-member Board, the Board shall not commence recovery of the erroneous payment by suspension or reduction of a monthly benefit payable by the Board until a decision with respect to such appeal seeking waiver has been made and notice thereof has been mailed to the claimant.</P>

            <P>Upon the filing of an appeal to the Board from a decision of a hearings officer, the Secretary to the Board shall notify all parties to the decision of the hearings officer that an appeal has been filed. The parties shall not have the right to submit additional evidence, except that:</P>
            <P>(a) The Board may permit the submission of additional evidence upon a showing by a party that he or she has additional evidence to present which, for valid reasons, he or she was unable to present at an earlier stage;</P>
            <P>(b) The Board may request the submission of additional evidence; and</P>
            <P>(c) The Board may designate any employee of the Board to take additional evidence and to report his or her findings to the Board. Any such additional evidence shall be submitted in such manner as the Board may indicate and shall be included in the record.</P>
            <P>(d) Any party may submit additional argument in writing with the appeal to the Board. No party shall have the right to an oral presentation before the Board except where the Board so permits. Such presentation may be limited in form, subject matter, length, and time as the Board may indicate to the parties.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure before Board after submission of report by hearings officer.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) After submission to the Board of a hearings officer's report, in an appeal involving employee status or the creditability of compensation, any party to the proceeding may, within twenty days after the mailing to him of a copy of the report, file with the Board and serve upon other parties by mailing to their last addresses of record such exceptions in writing as he desires to make to the hearings officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Each exception shall specifically designate the particular finding of fact or conclusion of law to which exception is taken, and shall set forth in detail the grounds of the exception. General exceptions and exceptions not specifically directed to particular findings of fact or conclusions of law will not be considered. Each party shall have ten days after the receipt of exceptions taken by other parties in which to file with the Board replies to the exceptions. The Board may, upon the application of any party and for cause shown, extend the time for filing and serving of exceptions or filing of replies thereto. The hearings officer's report shall be advisory but shall be presumed to be correct. Findings of fact to which no exceptions are taken will, subject only to the power of the Board to reject or modify, stand confirmed.</P>

            <P>(b) Further argument will not be permitted except upon a showing by any party that he has arguments to present which for valid reasons he was unable to present at an earlier stage, and in cases in which the Board requests further elaboration of arguments. In such cases, the further argument shall be submitted orally or in writing, as the Board may indicate in each case, and shall be subject to such restrictions as <PRTPAGE P="537"/>to form, subject matter, length, and time as the Board may indicate.</P>

Notice of such decision, together with the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law in connection therewith, shall, within 15 days from the date on which the decision is made, be mailed to the parties at the latest addresses furnished by them. Subject only to judicial review in accordance with § 320.45, the decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive for all purposes:</P>
            <P>(a) With respect to the initial determination involved, and</P>
            <P>(b) With respect to other initial determinations, irrespective of whether they have been appealed, which involve the same parties and which were based on the same issue or issues determined in the decision of the Board. In a case in which there has been a hearings officer's report, in an appeal involving employee status or the creditability of compensation, the decision of the Board on all issues determined in such decision shall be final and conclusively establish all rights and obligations, arising under the Act, of every party notified as hereinabove provided of his or her right to participate in the proceedings.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides benefits for a qualified employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness, as defined in section 1(k) of the Act. Under that section, no day can be a day of unemployment or a day of sickness for any employee if “remuneration” is payable or accrues to the employee for such day. In computing the amount of benefits payable to an employee for days of unemployment or days of sickness in any registration period, or in determining whether the employee has satisfied the waiting period requirement, the Board will not count any day with respect to <PRTPAGE P="539"/>which remuneration is payable or accrues to the employee. Section 322.2 defines the term “remuneration” and explains what types of payments to employees constitute remuneration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General definition of remuneration.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Remuneration.</E> (1) Remuneration includes pay for services for hire, pay for time lost as defined in § 322.6, and other earned income payable or accruing with respect to any day. Income is “earned” if it is payable or accrues in consideration of services and if such services were in turn rendered in consideration of the income payable or accruing.</P>
            <P>(2) Remuneration includes income in the form of a commodity, service, or privilege if, before the performance of the service for which it is payment, the parties have agreed upon the value of such commodity, service, or privilege, and that such part of the amount agreed upon to be paid may be paid in the form of such commodity, service, or privilege.</P>
            <P>(3) Remuneration for a working day that includes a part of two consecutive calendar days is deemed to have been earned on the first of such two days.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Subsidiary remuneration.</E> For the purpose of this part, remuneration does not include subsidiary remuneration, as defined in § 322.9. Subsidiary remuneration for any day does not prevent such day from being a day of unemployment or a day of sickness, except as explained in § 322.9.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Supplemental unemployment or sickness benefits.</E> The term remuneration does not include money payments received by an employee pursuant to any nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance, as defined in part 323 of this chapter. Employer payments of sick pay to an employee are remuneration, except when payment is made pursuant to a nongovernmental plan for sickness insurance.</P>

            <P>(1) The intention of the parties with respect to the remuneration as indicated in employment contracts, in any expressed or implied agreements between the parties, and by the actions of the parties;</P>
            <P>(2) Any evidence, such as vouchers or agreement of the parties, relating the remuneration to a particular period of time or indicating that the remuneration accrued or became payable without reference to any particular period of time;</P>
            <P>(3) The measure by which the amount of remuneration was determined;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether the amount of the remuneration is proportionate to the length of time needed to render the service for which it is payment;</P>
            <P>(5) Whether the service for which the remuneration accrues is required to be rendered on any particular day or particular days; and</P>
            <P>(6) Whether a specified amount of the remuneration is contingent upon a result accomplished on a particular day or particular days.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Layover days.</E> Remuneration shall not be regarded as payable or accruing to an employee with respect to his or her “layover” days between regular assignments in train and engine service solely because they are termed “layover” days. But no such “layover” day may be considered as a day of unemployment or sickness. See § 332.6 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Guaranteed earnings.</E> A payment under a plan which guarantees an amount of earnings or mileage in a specified period is remuneration with respect to each day in the specified period.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Equivalent of full-time work.</E> An employee who works fewer than five days each week under a compressed work schedule that provides the equivalent of full-time employment does not earn remuneration with respect to his or her additional rest days resulting <PRTPAGE P="540"/>from such work schedule, but such employee will not be considered to be available for work on such rest days.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In ascertaining the accrual of remuneration under a vacation agreement, consideration shall be given to the applicable agreements and practices, the interpretations of such agreements and practices developed by the parties, and the actions of the parties pursuant thereto. When there is information that an employee has received or is to receive payment under a vacation agreement, such payment shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be considered to be remuneration with respect to the days to which the payment is assigned.</P>

An employee shall be regarded as taking a vacation when, in accordance with the applicable agreements and practices (1) he is absent from work during a scheduled or assigned vacation period; (2) he is required to take his vacation with pay while he is on furlough; or (3) he chooses to take his vacation with pay while he is unemployed or absent from work due to illness or other personal circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Pay in lieu of vacation.</E> If a payment in lieu of vacation is made to an employee under a vacation agreement such payment shall not constitute remuneration with respect to any particular day or days. A payment under a vacation agreement shall be regarded as in lieu of vacation if:</P>
            <P>(1) The payment is made at the end of the vacation year to an employee who did not take his vacation during such year; or</P>
            <P>(2) The payment is made after the employee's death, or after he ceased service for the purpose of receiving an annuity, and the payment is credited to the employee's last day of service; or</P>
            <P>(3) It is otherwise established that the parties intended the payment to be in lieu of vacation, without reference to any particular period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Pay for time lost.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> The term “pay for time lost” means any payment made to an employee with respect to an identifiable period of time during which the employee was absent from the active service of the person or company making the payment, including absence on account of personal injury. The entire amount paid to an employee who was absent on account of personal injury is pay for time lost if such amount includes pay for time lost, unless at the time of payment the parties, by agreement, specify a different amount as the amount of the pay for time lost and the period of time covered by such pay. The amount allocated to time lost is remuneration for every day in the period of time lost. The amount of a payment for personal injury that is apportioned to factors other than time lost <PRTPAGE P="541"/>is, nevertheless, a portion of “damages” for the purposes of part 341 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Employment relationship required.</E> Pay for time lost shall not be deemed to have been earned on any day after the day of the employee's resignation or other termination of his employment relationship.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial evidence.</E> A report that an employee has received or is to receive pay for time lost shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be considered sufficient for a finding that remuneration is payable with respect to each day in the period to which the pay is assigned.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Dismissal, coordination, and separation allowances.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Coordination or dismissal allowance.</E> Coordination or dismissal allowances are payments made to an employee who has been furloughed for a specified period of time during which he or she continues in an employment relationship and remains subject to call. Such pay is remuneration with respect to each day in the month or other period for which it is payable. The employer shall be held liable to the Board for any benefits paid to the employee and found recoverable under section 2(f) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act by reason of the payment of any such allowances or other pay for the same days for which the Board paid benefits.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Separation allowance.</E> A separation allowance or severance payment made to an employee who voluntarily or involuntarily terminates his or her employment relationship is not remuneration with respect to any day after the employment relationship is severed. An employee who is paid a separation allowance, whether in a lump sum or in installments, is disqualified by section 4(a-1)(iii) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act from receiving unemployment or sickness benefits for the period of time approximating the length of time it would have taken the employee to earn, at his or her “straight” time rate of pay, the amount of the separation allowance if he or she had continued working in the job from which he or she separated.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Income from self-employment.</E> In determining whether income from self-employment is remuneration with respect to a particular day or particular days, consideration shall be given to whether, and to what extent, (1) such income can be related to services performed on the day or days and (2) the expenses of the self-employment can be attributed to the day or days. Income from services performed by an individual on a farm which he owns or rents, or in his own mercantile establishment, ordinarily is not remuneration with respect to any day.</P>

            <P>(1) The amount of the income;</P>
            <P>(2) The terms and conditions of payment;</P>
            <P>(3) The character and extent of the services rendered;</P>
            <P>(4) The importance, prestige, and responsibilities attached to the position;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Subsidiary remuneration.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> The term “subsidiary remuneration” means remuneration not in excess of an average of $15 per day for the period with respect to which it is payable or accrues, if</P>
            <P>(1) The work from which the remuneration derives requires substantially less than full time as determined by generally prevailing standards; and</P>
            <P>(2) The work is susceptible of performance at such times and under such circumstances as not to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time employment in another occupation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception.</E> If a claimant's remuneration is “compensation” as defined in part 302 of this chapter, such remuneration is not subsidiary unless the claimant had base year compensation from a different position or occupation of not less than two and one-half times the monthly compensation base for months in the base year in which he or she received the remuneration. Compensation in excess of an average of $15 per day is remuneration for the days for which it is payable or accrues.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Period for which remuneration is payable or accrues.</E> The “period” of time used in determining whether remuneration averages more than $15 per day depends on the terms and conditions of the employment and the rate of payment for the work. If the claimant is paid a monthly salary, the “month” is the period with respect to which the pay must average not more than $15 per day. The average is the monthly salary divided by 30. If the claimant is paid a weekly salary, the amount of the salary is divided by seven. If the claimant is paid by the hour or the day, the “period” is the day. Where payment is made by the hour or the day, the pay is not added up and then averaged out over the week or the month. For example, earnings of $20 on one day and $10 on another day do not average out to $15 per day so as to permit both days to be considered as days of unemployment or days of sickness.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Substantially less than full time.</E> The phrase “substantially less than full time” means employment of not more than four hours per day.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Compatibility with full time employment.</E> Work is considered to be susceptible of performance at such times and under such circumstances as not to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time employment in another position or occupation if it is a form of secondary employment that a claimant has done or could do at his or her own convenience while performing the duties of his or her railroad job.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Determinations.</E> The Board shall make a determination whether remuneration is subsidiary by applying the standards in this section to the facts of each case. Earnings that average more than $15 per day are not subsidiary remuneration under any circumstances. Also, earnings of any amount that are included in a claimant's qualifying base year compensation are not subsidiary remuneration. Even if earnings do not exceed an average of $15 per day, they may still not be subsidiary remuneration if the claimant worked more than four hours per day or if the work had to be performed at such times and under such circumstances as to be inconsistent with the holding of normal full-time work in his or her regular railroad work. If the evidence does not establish that the earnings are subsidiary remuneration, the question whether they are remuneration for particular days will then be considered.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate this section.</P>

            <P>(1) A claimant receives a salary of $350 per month for serving as secretary-treasurer of the local lodge of his union. He performs a variety of duties at his own convenience while holding down a full-time railroad job in his craft. The average payment per day is not more than $15 and is, therefore, subsidiary remuneration.<PRTPAGE P="543"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A claimant worked three hours per day, at $5 per hour, in the family insurance business. He was marked up for work as an extra board trainman and worked whenever he was called. When called, he skipped work in the family insurance business. His insurance earnings of $15 per day were subsidiary remuneration.</P>
            <P>(3) While unemployed from her railroad job, a claimant took a job as a school bus driver. She worked from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., and 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Her regular railroad job was a daytime job from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Her pay as a school bus driver was not subsidiary remuneration because the job was not compatible with the holding of full time work in her regular railroad occupation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part defines the phrase <E T="03">nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance</E> and sets forth the procedure by which an employer may obtain a determination by the Railroad Retirement Board as to whether a particular plan that such employer maintains for its employees qualifies as a nongovernmental plan. In general, any payment by an employer to an employee for services rendered as an employee will be considered to be <E T="03">remuneration</E> within the meaning of section 1(j) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and part 322 of this chapter. This includes employer payments that relate to an employee's loss of earnings during a period of time when the employee is unemployed or sick, including sickness resulting from injury. The exception is when an employer pays an employee a benefit pursuant to the provisions of a nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance established by an employer for the benefit of its employees. Benefit payments under such plans are not remuneration and do not affect an employee's eligibility for unemployment or sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>

            <P>(b) This part does not have any general applicability to private insurance contracts under which an insurance company, pursuant to a policy of insurance maintained by or for an employee, pays medical or hospital expenses or other cash benefits to or in behalf of an employee. Nor does this part apply to any private plan for relief of unemployment established by a party other than an employer such as, for example, a plan established by a labor union under which it undertakes to pay benefits to striking members of the union out of a strike insurance fund. Insurance policy benefits and strike unemployment benefits, although paid under plans that are nongovernmental in nature, are not considered remuneration for services under the general definition of <E T="03">remuneration.</E> See part 322 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definition of nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance.</SUBJECT>

            <P>A nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance is a benefit plan, program or policy that is in the nature of insurance and is designed and established by an employer for the purpose of supplementing the benefits that an employee of such employer may receive under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act during a period of unemployment or sickness. A nongovernmental plan may be established by labor-management agreement or by unilateral employer action. Payments under such plans are referred to <PRTPAGE P="544"/>as supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB pay) or supplemental sickness benefits, rather than as wages, salary or pay for time lost, because their inherent nature is to supplement benefit payments under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act rather than to replace or duplicate such payments.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 323.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Standards for Board approval of a nongovernmental plan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>An unemployment or sickness benefit plan qualifies as a nongovernmental plan if it conforms to the following standards:</P>
            <P>(a) The plan is in writing and has been published or otherwise communicated to covered employees prior to the inception of the plan;</P>
            <P>(b) Benefits under the plan are payable only to employees who are involuntarily laid off or separated from the service of the employer or who are absent from work on account of illness or injury;</P>
            <P>(c) Payment of benefits under the plan is conditioned upon a covered employee's meeting the eligibility conditions governing payment of benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. However, a plan will not be disqualified merely because it:</P>
            <P>(1) Provides benefits during any waiting period required under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, or</P>
            <P>(2) Provides benefits after an employee has exhausted rights to benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, or</P>
            <P>(3) Provides benefits during a period when the employee is not a “qualified employee”, within the meaning of part 302 of this chapter;</P>

            <P>(d) Payment of benefits under the plan is coordinated with benefit payments to which the employee may be entitled under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. In general, plan benefit payments will be considered coordinated with Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefit payments when computation of the plan benefits takes Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefit entitlement into consideration in such a way as to make it clear that the plan is supplementing Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefit payments for days of unemployment or days of sickness. For example, a plan that provides for payment of a specified daily benefit amount is considered coordinated with Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefit payments if the plan provides that the daily benefit amount otherwise payable to the employee is reduced by the amount of benefits that the employee received or could receive under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act for the same day if the employee had met all the eligibility criteria for such benefit. Similarly, there is acceptable coordination if the plan simply provides for payment of an amount as an “add-on” benefit to the amount of Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefits paid or payable. On the other hand, a plan that allows payment so as to compensate an employee for railroad or non-railroad earnings that are lower in amount than what the employee would get under the plan if he or she were not employed is not considered coordinated with benefit payments under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act because an employer payment made under such circumstances supplements earnings rather than benefit payments under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. No Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefits are payable to an employee who is earning remuneration from railroad or non-railroad employment. Employer payments that make up for low earnings are pay for time lost and therefore are <E T="03">compensation</E> and <E T="03">remuneration</E>;</P>
            <P>(e) The plan confers upon covered employees an enforceable right to the benefits under the plan. The plan may not commit to management discretion any decision as to whether such employee will actually be paid the benefits to which he is entitled under the plan or the amount to be paid;</P>
            <P>(f) The plan may not provide benefits to a covered employee in an amount that, when added to his or her Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act benefits, is greater than the wages of salary that would have been paid if the employee were employed; and</P>

            <P>(g) The plan incorporates the features set forth in § 323.4 of this part and has been approved by the Board's Director of Unemployment and Sickness <PRTPAGE P="545"/>Insurance as a nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Guidelines for content of a nongovernmental plan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>At a minimum, a nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance should contain the following features:</P>
            <P>(a) The title of the plan (e.g., Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan or Supplemental Sickness Benefit Plan);</P>
            <P>(b) A statement of purpose, such as the following:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <P>There is hereby established a nongovernmental plan for (unemployment insurance) (sickness insurance) [specify which one] within the meaning of section 1(j) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The purpose of this plan is to supplement the benefits that an eligible employee may receive under that Act and not to replace or duplicate such benefits. Payments under this plan are designed as one of the benefits of employment with [name of employer] and are not intended as pay for time lost or any other form of remuneration for services rendered as an employee;</P>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <P>(c) A statement as to which class or craft of employees, or other specified group of employees, is covered by the plan;</P>
            <P>(d) The criteria governing a particular covered employee's eligibility for supplemental benefits under the plan;</P>
            <P>(e) The dollar amount of supplemental benefits payable on a periodic basis to an eligible employee, the duration of supplemental benefits, how such benefits will be computed, and the conditions under which an employee will be disqualified or benefit payments reduced or terminated; and</P>
            <P>(f) The identity of the plan administrator and the procedure by which a covered employee may claim supplemental benefits under the plan, including forms to be filed (if any), how to file, the time limit for filing, and how an employee may appeal from a denial of supplemental benefits.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Day of unemployment.</E> A “day of unemployment” is a calendar day on which an employee, although ready and willing to work, is unemployed, and on <PRTPAGE P="546"/>which no remuneration is payable and for which the employee has registered, as required by this part. The amount of compensable days of unemployment shall be computed in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Registration period.</E> Except for registration periods in extended unemployment benefit periods, a “registration period” means a period of 14 consecutive days beginning with the first day for which an employee registers following:</P>
            <P>(1) His or her last day of work, or</P>
            <P>(2) The last day of the employee's last preceding registration period, and with respect to which the employee properly files a claim for benefits on such form and in such manner as the Board prescribes.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">General waiting period.</E> Benefits are payable to any qualified employee for each day of unemployment in excess of seven during his or her first registration period in a period of continuing unemployment if such period of continuing unemployment is his or her initial period of continuing unemployment beginning in the benefit year, and then for each day of unemployment in excess of four during any subsequent registration period within the same period of continuing unemployment. A strike waiting period, described in paragraph (d) of this section, will satisfy a general waiting period with respect to a benefit year.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Strike waiting period.</E> If a qualified employee has a period of continuing unemployment that includes days of unemployment due to a stoppage of work because of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which he or she was last employed, no benefits are payable for his or her first 14 days of unemployment due to such stoppage of work. For subsequent days of unemployment due to the same stoppage of work, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of four in each subsequent registration period within the period of continuing unemployment. If such period of continuing unemployment ends because the employee has exhausted his or her benefits as provided for under part 336 of this chapter, but the stoppage of work continues, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of seven in the employee's first registration period in a new period of continuing unemployment based upon the same stoppage of work and for days of unemployment in excess of four in subsequent registration periods in the same period of continuing unemployment.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Period of continuing unemployment.</E> A “period of continuing unemployment” means a single registration period that includes more than four days of unemployment or a series of consecutive periods each of which includes more than four days of unemployment, or a series of successive registration periods, each of which includes more than four days of unemployment, if each succeeding registration period begins within 15 days after the last day of the immediately preceding registration period. An employee's period of continuing unemployment ends on the last day of a benefit year in which he or she exhausts rights to unemployment benefits as provided for in part 336 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Computation of compensable days</E>—(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> An employee has an initial period of continuing unemployment from June 14 through July 25 and is unemployed on all days in that period. The employee's first registration period covers June 14 to June 27, and his subsequent registration periods cover June 28 to July 11 and July 12 to July 25. Under paragraph (c) of this section, a one-week waiting period applies to his first registration period and the employee is therefore paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of seven in that period. The employee is then paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of four in each of the two ensuing registration periods. [Note: if this employee's period of continuing unemployment had been the result of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which the employee was last employed, then under paragraph (d) of this section, no benefits would be payable for the period June 14 to June 27, and benefits would then be payable for days of unemployment in excess of four in each of the ensuing registration periods.]</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> Same facts as in example 1, but the employee is unemployed again beginning August 18. Since August 18 is more than 15 days after July <PRTPAGE P="547"/>25, the end of his last registration period, the employee begins a new period of continuing unemployment. The employee's first registration period in the new period of continuing unemployment covers August 18 to August 31. The employee is paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of seven in that registration period because that period is the employee's first registration period in a new period of continuing unemployment commencing in the benefit year beginning July 1, and he or she did not previously have a waiting period in any registration period earlier in that benefit year. The employee's next registration period covers September 1 to September 14, and the employee returned to work on September 12. In that registration period, the employee has 11 days of unemployment and is therefore paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of four.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> Same facts as in examples 1 and 2, but the employee then has a new period of continuing unemployment beginning November 1 in the same benefit year. November 1 to November 14 is the employee's first registration period in that period of continuing unemployment. The employee is paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of four in that registration period and for days of unemployment in excess of four in any subsequent registration period in the same benefit year because earlier in the benefit year the employee had a registration period, August 18 to August 31, in which he or she satisfied the waiting period.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Remuneration exceeds base year compensation.</E> (1) No benefits are payable to any otherwise eligible employee for any day of unemployment in a registration period where the total amount of remuneration, as defined in part 322 of this chapter, payable to the employee during a registration period exceeds the amount of the base year monthly compensation base. For this purpose an employee is considered to have received the amount he would have earned except for the fact that he declined suitable work available to him or her during the registration period.</P>
            <P>(2) Days of unemployment which are not compensable by virtue of paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall nevertheless be counted as days of unemployment for purposes of determining whether the general waiting period, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, has been satisfied, and for purposes of determining a period of continuing unemployment.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Pay for time lost.</E> An employee may claim unemployment benefits in accordance with this part even though he or she is also pursuing a claim for pay for time lost or other remuneration. If such pay is awarded to the employee with respect to any day for which the Board has paid him or her unemployment benefits, the Board will recover the amount of unemployment benefits that was paid for any day or days for which he or she was awarded pay for time lost. See part 322 of this chapter. It is the employee's responsibility to tell the Board that he or she has filed or intends to file a claim for time lost.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for registering for unemployment benefits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Registering as unemployed.</E> To claim unemployment benefits for any day, an employee must register as unemployed by doing the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Apply for unemployment benefits and employment service in accordance with § 325.3;</P>
            <P>(2) File a claim in accordance with § 325.4; and</P>
            <P>(3) Provide any other information that the Board needs to properly adjudicate his or her right to unemployment benefits.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">No benefits payable without registration.</E> No unemployment benefits shall be paid to any otherwise qualified employee with respect to any day claimed as a day of unemployment, and no waiting period credit shall be allowed, until such time as the employee has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When a registration period may begin.</E> When registering for unemployment benefits, an employee may claim benefits for any calendar day on which he or she is unemployed and believes himself or herself to be eligible for benefits. A registration period may begin <PRTPAGE P="548"/>as early as the first calendar day on which an employee is unemployed following his or her last day of work even though such first calendar day would have been a rest day if the employee had not become unemployed. However, a registration period may not begin with any calendar day with respect to which an employee has received or will receive remuneration.

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Friday, September 2, after working his regular shift on that day. His first 14-day registration period could start as early as Saturday, September 3. A registration period starting on September 3 would end on September 16. If he continues to be unemployed, his next registration period could begin September 17 and end September 30, and so forth.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Friday, September 2, but he decides to take two weeks' vacation pay covering days through Friday, September 16. Because he will have received remuneration for days through September 16, his claim for unemployment benefits could begin on Saturday, September 17, if he continues to be unemployed after his vacation ends.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
              <P>An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Monday, September 5, after working his regular shift on that day. His first 14-day registration period could begin on Tuesday, September 6, the first day on which he was unemployed following his last day of work.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 325.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Application for unemployment benefits and employment service.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> An unemployed employee who wishes to claim unemployment benefits shall apply for such benefits by completing the form prescribed by the Board for that purpose. Such form shall also constitute an application for employment service. An application will be required at the beginning of each period of unemployment in a benefit year unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The employee filed an application for an initial period of unemployment in a benefit year and has a subsequent period of unemployment within the same benefit year; or</P>
            <P>(2) The employee had filed an application for benefits for a period of unemployment that began in the preceding benefit year and the period of unemployment continued into the next ensuing benefit year.</P>
            <FP>In either of these circumstances, the initial application will be treated as an application for days in the subsequent period of unemployment or as an application for days in the next ensuing benefit year, as the case may be.</FP>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose of application.</E> An application for unemployment benefits and employment service is a document that serves three purposes. First, it identifies an employee who has become unemployed and wishes to begin receiving unemployment benefits. Second, it assists the Board in determining whether the applicant is a qualified employee and if so, whether any of the information reported on the application affects his or her eligibility for payment of benefits. Third, it assists the Board in placing the employee in any suitable employment that may be available.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for filing application.</E> An employee may deliver or mail his or her application to any Board office, but such application must be received at a Board office within 30 calendar days of the first day that the employee intends to claim as a day of unemployment. For example, if an employee becomes unemployed on October 31 and intends to claim unemployment benefits for days starting November 1, the application must reach a Board office no later than November 30. If the application is received December 1, the employee may not be paid unemployment benefits for November 1 as such day would not be considered as a “day of unemployment”. If an employee returns to work and then becomes unemployed again within the same benefit year, he or she is not required to file a new application for benefits and employment service but need only contact the nearest Board office to obtain a claim form and file such form as described in § 325.4.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Extension of time for filing.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, the Board will consider an application for unemployment benefits as timely filed if:</P>

            <P>(1) The employee can show that he or she made a reasonable effort to file the form on time but was prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his or her control; provided, however, that <PRTPAGE P="549"/>lack of diligence, forgetfulness or lack of knowledge of the time limit for applying shall not be considered to be a circumstance beyond the employee's control; and</P>
            <P>(2) The employee files an application within one year of the day or days that he or she claims as a day or days of unemployment.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 325.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Claim for unemployment benefits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> After an unemployed employee has applied for unemployment benefits in accordance with § 325.3, he or she shall claim a day as a day of unemployment by registering with respect to such day. Registration shall be made on the claim form provided by the Board to the employee.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Claim.</E> A claim for unemployment benefits shall cover a period of 14 consecutive calendar days. Each such 14-day period shall be a registration period. An employee shall provide the information called for by the claim form and shall file his or her claim in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for filing.</E> A claim for unemployment benefits shall be filed at any Board office no later than 15 calendar days after the last day of the claim period, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or 15 calendar days after the date on which the claim form was mailed to the employee, whichever is later. In determining whether the time for filing the claim may be extended, the standards set forth in § 325.3(d) shall be applied. None of the days included in a claim that is not timely filed shall be considered a day of unemployment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Claim for new period of unemployment.</E> An employee who has complied with the application requirement under § 325.3 with respect to a period of unemployment in a benefit year, and who again becomes unemployed in the same benefit year, need not file a new application but may initiate a claim for benefits for days in such subsequent period by calling or visiting the nearest district office of the Board to request a claim form. Such request shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the first day for which the employee wishes to claim benefits. Upon receipt of a request under this paragraph, the district office shall provide the employee with a claim form which shall show the beginning and ending dates of the registration period covered by the claim form, with the first day shown on the claim form being no earlier than the 30th day before the date on which the employee requested the claim form, unless the delay may be excused by applying the standards set forth in § 325.3(d).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Delayed claims.</E> If an employee makes an initial application and claim for benefits in accordance with this part but does not continue to file ongoing claims because he or she receives an initial determination denying his or her application or claim for benefits and if, upon review, the denial is reversed by an appeals referee or other authorized reviewing official, the employee shall have 30 days from the date of the notice of the reversal in which to file a claim or claims for benefits for the days that he or she would have claimed as days of unemployment but for the initial determination denying benefits. The appeals referee or other reviewing official, as appropriate, shall notify the employee of the 30-day time limit imposed by this paragraph. An employee whose claim for benefits has been denied may continue to claim any additional day or days for which he or she believes that he or she is eligible for benefits.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Claim required for waiting period.</E> The requirement to file a claim for unemployment benefits includes a requirement to file a claim for the non-compensable waiting period described in § 325.1(d), except that the Director of Unemployment and Sickness Insurance may waive such requirement in connection with unemployment resulting from a work stoppage or other labor dispute.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Withdrawal of claim.</E> An employee may withdraw his or her claim for unemployment benefits by submitting a written statement to that effect and by repaying any benefits paid on the claim, unless the employee's claim was intentionally false or fraudulent.</P>

The verification procedures shall include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(a) Pre-payment contacts with railroad employers, utilizing data processing techniques to the extent feasible so as not to delay unduly the payment of valid claims; and</P>

            <P>The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of unemployment benefits to qualified railroad employees for days of unemployment. Under section 1(k) of the Act, an unemployed employee must be “available for work” as a condition of eligibility for unemployment benefits for any day claimed as a day of unemployment. This part defines the phrase “available for work” and explains how the Board will apply that phrase to claims for unemployment benefits.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Information indicating unavailability.</E> If the office of the Board which is adjudicating a claimant's claims for <PRTPAGE P="551"/>benefits receives information indicating that the claimant may not be available for work, he shall be required to submit evidence of his availability for work, and no benefits shall thereafter be paid with respect to any day in the period of the claimant's unemployment unless sufficient evidence of the claimant's availability for work on such day is presented.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employee who has retired voluntarily.</E> An employee who has retired voluntarily shall be presumed not to be eligible for unemployment benefits. An employee shall be regarded as having retired voluntarily if his not being in the active service of his employer is due to an agreement between his labor organization and his employer requiring retirement upon attaining a certain age.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Equivalent of full-time work.</E> (1) A claimant who is continuously employed from week to week under a work schedule that provides the equivalent of full-time employment shall not be considered available for work with respect to any rest day or other non-work day within a 14-day registration period.</P>

            <P>(2) The application of paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1):</HD>
              <P>A claimant's regular work schedule requires him or her to work five nine-hour days one week followed by three nine-hour days and one eight-hour day in the next week. The claimant has five non-work days within this two-week period. The claimant is not considered available for work on those non-work days.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2):</HD>
              <P>On Monday an employee who has been working a shift which has Saturdays and Sundays off changes to a shift which normally has Wednesdays and Thursdays off. As a consequence, the employee has six non-work days within a 14-day period. The employee is not considered available for work with respect to any of the six non-work days.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (3):</HD>
              <P>An employee regularly receives remuneration for 40 hours per week by working 10 hours on each of four days per week, thus giving him or her six rest days in a 14-day period. The employee will not be considered available for work on the rest days.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Attendance in school or training course.</E> (1) A claimant who has voluntarily left work to enroll as a student in an educational institution shall be presumed not to be available for work. For the purpose of this provision, leaving work is considered voluntary when the claimant on his or her own initiative left work that he or she could have continued to perform but for the claimant's decision to attend school. In all other cases, this presumption shall not apply, but eligibility shall instead be determined on the basis of the facts of each case. In each such case, the claimant shall be given an opportunity to establish that he or she remains ready and willing to engage in full-time employment for hire, notwithstanding his or her school attendance. If a claimant is enrolled in a vocational training program at a trade or technical school, he or she shall be considered available for work if his or her current prospects for work are poor and the vocational training can reasonably be expected to increase his or her prospects for obtaining new employment.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The application of paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1):</HD>
              <P>An individual is laid off by his or her railroad employer. Instead of looking for other employment, the individual decides to enter college in order to become a teacher. He or she is enrolled as a full-time day student. The individual is not available for work.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (2):</HD>
              <P>An employee is furloughed by his or her railroad employer and will not likely be able to return to railroad work. After making a reasonable effort to obtain work and finding none, the individual enrolls in a six-month course of training, which upon completion would permit him or her to obtain an entry level job in the data processing industry. The individual is considered available for work while training for the data processing job.</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure to work in anticipation of maximum mileage.</E> (1) An employee in train and engine service who voluntarily lays off work in anticipation of reaching the maximum mileage or earnings permitted under an agreement with his or her employer shall not be considered available for work.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example.</E> Halfway through the month an engineer has worked in train service covering 2,000 miles. By agreement with his or her employer he or she may not operate a train in excess of 3,000 miles per month. In order to allow engineers with less seniority to <PRTPAGE P="552"/>perform service, the engineer lays off work for five days. The engineer is not considered available for work on those days.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Confinement.</E> A claimant who is confined in a penal institution or is in the custody of a Federal, State or local governmental unit or official thereof shall not be considered available for work. An individual shall not be considered in the custody of a governmental unit or official thereof if he or she has been released on bail and is awaiting trial or he or she has been placed on probation or parole. However, an individual who has been released from custody by a governmental unit or official thereof under a program that permits leave from custody of a short duration, after which he or she must return to custody, shall not be considered available for work on those days on which he or she is on furlough from confinement.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Missed turns in pool service.</E> A train and engine service employee assigned to pool service shall not be considered as ready to work, within the meaning of § 327.5(c) of this part, with respect to any day on which such employee would have worked if he or she had not missed his or her turn in pool service employment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of benefits, at a specified daily benefit rate, to any qualified employee for his or her days of unemployment or days of sickness, subject to a maximum amount per day. The “daily benefit rate” for an employee is the amount of benefits that he or she may receive for each compensable day of unemployment or sickness in any registration <PRTPAGE P="553"/>period in a period of continuing unemployment or sickness.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Computation of daily benefit rate.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic formula.</E> A qualified employee's daily benefit rate for a given benefit year, as defined in part 302 of this chapter, is an amount equal to 60 percent of the employee's daily rate of compensation for his or her last railroad employment in the applicable base year, but such rate will not exceed the maximum amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section nor will it be less than $12.70 per day.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum daily benefit rate.</E> The maximum daily benefit rate is the product of the monthly compensation base, as computed under part 302 of this chapter, for the base year immediately preceding the beginning of the benefit year, multiplied by five percent. If the maximum daily benefit rate so computed is not a multiple of $1.00, the Board will round it down to the nearest multiple of $1.00.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When increase effective.</E> Whenever the annual application of the formula in paragraph (b) of this section triggers an increase in the maximum daily benefit rate, such increase will apply to days of unemployment or days of sickness in registration periods beginning after June 30 of the calendar year immediately following the base year referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice.</E> Whenever the annual application of the formula in paragraph (b) of this section triggers an increase in the maximum daily benefit rate, or if the annual application of the formula does not trigger an increase, the Board will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> explaining how it computed the maximum daily benefit rate for the year. The Board will also notify each employer of the maximum amount of the daily benefit rate. The Board will make the computation as soon as it has computed the amount of the monthly compensation base under part 302 of this chapter and will publish notice as soon as possible thereafter, but in no event later than June 1 of each year. Information as to the current amount of the maximum daily benefit rate will also be available in any Board district or regional office.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Sources of information.</E> In determining an employee's daily rate of compensation for the purpose of computing his or her daily benefit rate, the Board will rely on information furnished by the employee and his or her last employer in the base year. An employee's earnings from employment not covered by the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act are not considered in computing his or her daily benefit rate.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 330.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Daily rate of compensation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> An employee's daily rate of compensation is his or her straight-time rate of pay, including any cost-of-living allowance provided in any applicable working agreement. It does not include any overtime pay, penalty payment, or other special allowance except as hereinafter provided. An employer's or employee's report of the daily rate of compensation shall, in the absence of information to the contrary, and subject to the considerations set forth in this section and §§ 330.4 and 330.5, be considered to show the daily rate of compensation of the employee by or for whom the report has been furnished. Where a rate other than a daily rate is reported, the Board will convert it to a daily rate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Hourly, weekly or monthly rate.</E> An hourly rate shall be converted to a daily rate by multiplying such hourly rate by the number of hours constituting a working day for the employee's occupation or class of service. A weekly or monthly rate shall be converted to a daily rate by dividing such rate by the number of working days constituting the work week or work month, as the case may be, for the employee's occupation or class of service.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Mileage rate.</E> When a collective bargaining agreement provides for payment of compensation on a mileage basis, the employee's daily rate of compensation is his or her rate of pay for the number of miles constituting a basic day, including any allowance, as prescribed by the agreement, that is added to his or her basic rate of pay for <PRTPAGE P="554"/>the number of miles constituting a basic day.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Piece rate or tonnage rate.</E> Where a piece rate or tonnage rate is reported, the daily rate of compensation shall be determined by computing the employee's average earnings per day for the days on which he or she worked substantially full time (excluding any overtime pay or penalty rates) at such piece rate or tonnage rate during the last two pay periods in which he or she engaged in such work in the base year.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Commissions or percentage of sales.</E> Where the compensation reported consists of or includes commissions or percentages of sales, the daily rate of such commissions or percentage of sales shall be determined by computing the employee's average net commissions or percentage earnings (excluding any amounts he or she received to compensate him or her for expenses) per day for the days in the last two pay periods in which he or she worked on a commission or percentage basis in the base year.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">International service.</E> In the case of an employee who, on his last day of employment in the base year, worked partly outside the United States and partly in the United States for an employer not conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, the employee's daily rate of compensation shall be determined in the same manner as it would if all his service on that day had been rendered in the United States.</P>
          </SECTION>

            <SECTNO>§ 330.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Last railroad employment in the base year.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The phrase “last railroad employment in the applicable base year,” as used in § 330.2(a) of this part, means generally the employee's last “service performed as an employee,” within the meaning of section 1(g) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. If an employee did not actually perform any service as an employee in the applicable base year (the calendar year preceding a benefit year) but did receive qualifying compensation such as vacation pay or pay for time lost for days in such base year, the Board will consider that his or her last railroad employment in the base year was the employment on which the qualifying compensation was based. The daily rate of such compensation shall be deemed to be the employee's daily rate of compensation for purposes of this part. If an employee's last railroad employment in the base year was casual or temporary work and was performed while on furlough from other base year railroad employment, the Board will disregard the daily rate of compensation paid for the casual or temporary work if such rate of compensation produces a daily benefit rate lower than the daily benefit rate based on the daily rate of compensation for the employment from which the employee was furloughed.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 330.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedure for obtaining and using information about daily rate of compensation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Information furnished by employers.</E> Every employer, as defined in part 301 of this chapter, shall furnish information to the Board with respect to the daily rate of compensation of each employee for his or her last employment in the applicable base year. The employer shall make such report when it files its annual report of compensation in accordance with part 209 of this chapter and shall use the form prescribed by the Board for that purpose. If an employee's last daily rate of compensation in the base year is $99.99 or more, the employer may report such rate as $99.99 instead of the employee's actual last daily rate of compensation. In the absence of evidence to the contrary or a challenge by the employee, the daily rate of compensation provided by an employer under this section shall be used to compute a qualified employee's daily benefit rate. If an employer fails to report the last daily rate of compensation for a qualified employee who has applied for benefits or if an employee challenges the daily rate reported by an employer, the procedure in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will apply.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Information furnished by employee.</E> The Board will afford an employee an opportunity to establish his or her last daily rate of compensation if the base year employer did not report a rate for the employee on its annual report of <PRTPAGE P="555"/>compensation or if the employee challenges the accuracy of the rate reported by the employer. Unless deemed unreasonable, a daily rate of compensation reported by an employee under this paragraph will be used provisionally to compute his or her daily benefit rate, but such rate will be verified in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. In any case in which the employee's report is deemed unreasonable and no employer report has been provided, the employee's report shall be disregarded, and the Board will seek to verify the employee's last daily pay rate in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Pending receipt of such verification, the employee's daily benefit rate shall be set at $12.70. When an unverified and uncorrected pay rate has been verified or corrected, appropriate redetermination of the daily benefit rate shall be made, and such redetermined benefit rate shall be applied to all the employee's days of unemployment or sickness in the benefit year.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employer verification.</E> Whenever an employee has established a daily rate of compensation under paragraph (b) of this section, the Board will request the employee's base year employer to verify such rate within 30 days. If such verification is not received within 30 days, the employee's daily rate of compensation may be based upon other evidence gathered by the Board if such evidence is reasonable in light of compensation rates reported for other employees of the base year employer in the same occupation or class of service as the employer or in light of previous compensation rates reported by the base year employer for its employees. A daily benefit rate established under this paragraph may not exceed the maximum daily benefit rate established under this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Protest.</E> An employee who is dissatisfied with the daily benefit rate computed under this part may contest such computation in accordance with part 320 of this chapter.</P>

Nor shall a female employee be considered to lack remuneration with respect to a day solely because of the application to her of mileage or work restrictions or solely because she is standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty if the day is one on which, because of pregnancy, miscarriage, or the birth of a child, (1) she is unable to work or (2) working would be injurious to her health.</P>

When the arrangement is such that an employee in extra board, pool, or chain gang service gets the equivalent of full-time work, his lack of remuneration on any non-work day shall, subject to the provisions of § 332.2(b), be considered as due solely to the application to him of a mileage or work restriction.</P>

            <P>An employee who has the equivalent of full-time work with respect to service on days within a registration period is not eligible for unemployment benefits for any non-work days within such registration period. In determining whether an employee has the equivalent of full-time work, the Board will consider the provisions of labor-management agreements that prescribe the number of miles or hours of credit constituting a basic work day, week, or month in the employee's occupation or service. The Board will consider that an employee had the equivalent of full-time work if the number of miles or hours credited to the employee for <PRTPAGE P="557"/>service in the registration period is at least 10 times the number of miles or hours constituting a basic day in the employee's occupation or service. For this purpose, any miles or hours of credit not earned because the employee missed his or her turn and any penalty miles assessed to the employee shall be added to the miles or hours of credit actually earned on the basis of service on days within the registration period.</P>

Only employees who hold regular assignments may be regarded as standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty. In determining whether an employee has a regular assignment, consideration shall be given to whether the trips or tours of duty have definite starting times; whether there are a definite number of trips or tours of duty, either periodically or for the whole duration of the assignment; and whether there is a definite route of each trip or definite duration of each tour of duty. An employee who is separated from a regular assignment shall not be regarded as standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty. An employee shall be deemed separated from a regular assignment when he is suspended or discharged from service or displaced by a senior employee or held out of service for investigation or discipline, or when his regular assignment is abolished or discontinued.</P>

An employee's statement in connection with his claim that he was not out of service because of a lay-over or stand-by rule or because of a mileage or work restriction shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted as sufficient for a finding on that point. An employee's report of the number of miles or hours' credit earned in rotating extra board, pool, or chain gang service shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted as correct for purposes of determining whether he had the equivalent of full-time work during the period covered by his claim. When it appears clear that an employee in rotating extra board, pool, or chain gang service who fails to report the number of miles or hours' credit earned on days in the period covered by his claim form was not employed on enough days to have had the equivalent of full-time work in the period, no additional information as to mileage or work restrictions shall be deemed necessary for the determination of his claim.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory basis.</E> The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of sickness benefits to a qualified railroad employee for days of sickness within a period of continuing sickness. To establish basic eligibility for sickness benefits, a qualified employee must have at least four consecutive days of sickness with respect to each period of continuing sickness. The terms “day of sickness” and “period of continuing sickness” as used in this part, are defined in sections 1(k) and 2(a) of the Act, respectively, and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. As evidence of days of sickness based upon illness or injury or upon pregnancy, miscarriage or childbirth, section 1(k) <PRTPAGE P="558"/>requires an employee to file a statement of sickness. Other information that is required to identify an employee's days of sickness is obtained by means of an application for sickness benefits at the beginning of each period of continuing sickness and by means of a claim for sickness benefits which is filed for each registration period within a period of continuing sickness. The term “registration period”, generally refers to a period of 14 consecutive days and is defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Day of sickness.</E> The term “day of sickness” means, in general, any calendar day, including days that would normally be rest days, on which an employee is not able to work because of any physical or mental illness or injury. With respect to a female employee, a “day of sickness” also includes any calendar day on which she is not able to work, or working would be injurious to her health, because of pregnancy, miscarriage or childbirth.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Period of continuing sickness.</E> (1) The term “period of continuing sickness” refers to a period of time when an employee is not able to work on account of illness, injury, sickness or disease, including inability caused by pregnancy, miscarriage or childbirth. An employee has a period of continuing sickness under either of these circumstances:</P>
            <P>(i) He or she has any number of “consecutive” days of sickness based on one or more infirmities; or</P>
            <P>(ii) He or she has any number of “successive” days of sickness based on a single infirmity and there is no interruption of more than 90 “consecutive” days which are not days of sickness.</P>

            <P>(2) Days of sickness are “consecutive” when they occur one after another continuously and without interruption by any day that is not a day of sickness. Days of sickness are “successive” when one or more days of sickness follow any day of sickness with an interval of one or more days that are not days of sickness.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
              <P>An employee is sick for 11 “consecutive” days from October 1 through October 11, meaning that each day in the period October 1 through October 11 is a day of sickness and there is no day in that period that is not a day of sickness. If the employee also had days of sickness on October 16, 17, 18, 21 and 22, those five days are considered “successive” days of sickness.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(3) A period of continuing sickness with respect to any employee begins with the first day of a number of consecutive days of sickness or with the first day of a number of successive days of sickness attributable to a single cause with no interval of more than 90 days that are not days of sickness. In the example given in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, October 1 begins a period of continuing sickness. The days October 16, 17, 18, 21, and 22 are in the period of continuing sickness beginning October 1, and benefits are payable for them, provided that the employee's inability to work on those five days is due to one or more of the same infirmities that caused the employee to be unable to work on the days from October 1 through October 11. Otherwise, October 16 begins another period of continuing sickness.</P>
            <P>(4) A period of continuing sickness ends when either of these circumstances occurs:</P>
            <P>(i) 91 consecutive days have elapsed none of which is a day of sickness resulting from the infirmity that was the basis for the preceding days of sickness; or</P>
            <P>(ii) One or more days that are not days of sickness have elapsed and a statement of sickness is filed with respect to a day of sickness based on an infirmity other than any infirmity causing inability on the preceding days of sickness. The end of a benefit year, generally the 12-month period beginning July 1 of any year and ending June 30 of the next year (see 45 U.S.C. 351(m)), does not end a period of continuing sickness. In the example in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the inability to work on October 16 was not due to an infirmity or infirmities that caused the inability to work on October 11, then a period of continuing sickness ends on October 11. A new application and statement of sickness would be required in order for the employee to be paid sickness benefits for days beginning October 16. See § 335.2 of this part.</P>

            <P>(5) A period of continuing sickness can be interrupted, provided that:<PRTPAGE P="559"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The interruption is for not more than 90 consecutive days; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The days of sickness after the interruption are due to one or more of the same causes as the days of sickness before the interruption. A period of continuing sickness can be interrupted any number of times so long as each interruption is not more than 90 days and the days of sickness are all due to the same cause. If a period of continuing sickness is caused by more than one infirmity, any one of the infirmities can be considered as the single continuing cause that will permit the interruption of the period of continuing sickness for not more than 90 days without ending it.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Registration period.</E> The term “registration period” means, with respect to any employee, the period which begins with the first day with respect to which a statement of sickness for a period of continuing sickness is filed in his or her behalf in accordance with this part, or the first such day after the end of a registration period which will have begun with a day with respect to which a statement of sickness for a period of continuing sickness was filed in his or her behalf, and ends with whichever is the earlier of:</P>
            <P>(1) The thirteenth day thereafter; or</P>
            <P>(2) The day immediately preceding the day with respect to which a statement of sickness for a new period of continuing sickness is filed in his or her behalf. However, each of the successive 14-day periods in an extended sickness benefit period shall constitute a registration period.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Liability for infirmity.</E> When sickness benefits are paid to an employee on the basis of an infirmity for which he or she recovers a personal injury settlement or judgment, the Board shall receive reimbursement for the sickness benefits in accordance with part 341 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(1) An application for sickness benefits at the beginning of each period of continuing sickness;</P>
            <P>(2) A statement of sickness to accompany the employee's application;</P>
            <P>(3) A claim for sickness benefits for each 14-day registration period during the employee's period of continuing sickness; and</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Mailing or delivering the forms.</E> The forms required by paragraph (a) of this section may be mailed or delivered to any Board office.

Instructions for completing and filing the forms are printed on the forms themselves.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, statements of sickness and claims for sickness benefits must be filed within the time limits specified by this section. Failure to comply with the time restrictions on filing claims will result in a denial of benefits for days for which timely statements and claims are not filed, as such days would not be considered days of sickness.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Statement of sickness.</E> An employee shall file a statement of sickness within ten calendar days of the first day that he or she wishes to claim as a day of sickness. For example, if an employee wishes to claim sickness benefits for days starting November 1, the statement of sickness should reach the Board no later than November 10. If the statement of sickness is received November 11, the employee cannot be paid sickness benefits for November 1. Such day would not be considered as a “day of sickness”, unless the form may be considered as timely filed under paragraph (d)(3), (4) or (5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Claim for sickness benefits.</E> An employee shall file a claim for sickness benefits within 30 days after the ending date shown on the claim form, or within 30 days after the date on which the Board mails the claim form to the employee, whichever date is later. Failure to comply with this provision shall bar the payment of sickness benefits with respect to any day included within the calendar period covered by the claim form.

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
              <P>If a form for claiming sickness benefits is mailed to an employee on July 13, for the period from July 1 to July 14, the employee must file the claim within 30 days after July 14 [on or before August 13], to be paid benefits for the period July 1 to July 14. If the claim form was not mailed to the employee until July 16, the claim must be filed within 30 days after July 16 [on or before August 15].</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When form considered timely filed.</E> The Board will consider a statement of sickness or a claim for sickness benefits as timely filed if:</P>
            <P>(1) The statement or form was received in a Board office within the prescribed time; or</P>
            <P>(2) The statement or form was mailed to a Board office in accordance with instructions printed on the form and was received at such office; or</P>
            <P>(3) The employee made a reasonable effort to file the statement of sickness or claim form within the prescribed time but was prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his or her control, and such statement or claim was received at a Board office within a reasonable time following the removal of the circumstances that prevented the employee from filing the form. The phrase “circumstances beyond his or her control” shall not include an employee's forgetfulness or lack of knowledge of the sickness benefit program or the time limit for filing for sickness benefits or any other lack of diligence by the employee. For the purposes of this provision, if a statement of sickness is not received within the prescribed time but is received within 30 days of the first day that an employee intends to claim as a day of sickness, the Board will consider that the employee made a reasonable effort to file the statement within the prescribed time, unless it is clear on the basis of affirmative evidence that the delay was not the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control; or</P>

            <P>(4) The employee mistakenly registered for unemployment benefits when he or she should have applied for sickness benefits for the day or days claimed and the appropriate statement of sickness was then received at an office of the Board within a reasonable time after unemployment benefits were denied; or<PRTPAGE P="561"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim that is not filed within two years of the day or days claimed shall not be considered as timely filed, and such day or days shall not be considered as days of sickness.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Days for which no statement of sickness deemed filed.</E> A statement of sickness shall not be deemed to be filed with respect to any day in a benefit year in which the employee is not a qualified employee as defined in section 3 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act or has exhausted his or her rights to sickness benefits under the Act.

            <SUBJECT>Payment of sickness benefits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as provided in this section, benefits are payable to any qualified employee for each day of sickness after the fourth consecutive day of sickness in a period of continuing sickness, as defined in § 335.1(c), but excluding four days of sickness in any registration period in such period of continuing sickness.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiting period.</E> Benefits are payable to any qualified employee for each day of sickness in excess of seven during his or her first registration period in a period of continuing sickness if such period of continuing sickness is his or her initial period of continuing sickness beginning in the benefit year. For this purpose, the first registration period in a period of continuing sickness is the registration period that first begins with four consecutive days of sickness and includes more than four days of sickness. For the purpose of computing benefits under this section, a period of continuing sickness ends on the last day of a benefit year in which the employee exhausts rights to sickness benefits as provided for under part 336 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Computation of compensable days</E>—(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> An employee has an initial period of continuing sickness from June 14 through July 25, and all days in that period are days of sickness. The employee's first registration period covers June 14 to June 27, and his or her subsequent registration period covers June 28 to July 11, and July 12 to July 25. In the one-week waiting period the employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of seven. In each of the two ensuing registration periods the employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of four.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> Same facts as in Example 1, but the employee later has a new period of continuing sickness based upon a different illness or impairment beginning September 17. The employee's first registration period in his or her new period of continuing sickness covers September 17 to September 30. The employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of seven in that 14-day period because that period is his or her first registration period in a new period of continuing sickness commencing in the benefit year beginning July 1, and he or she did not previously have a waiting period in any registration period earlier in the benefit year.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> Same facts as in examples 1 and 2, but the employee then has a new period of continuing sickness beginning January 1 in the same benefit year. January 1 to January 14 is the employee's first registration period in that period of continuing sickness. The employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of four in that registration period because earlier in the benefit year he or she had a registration period, September 17 to September 30, in which he or she satisfied the initial seven-day waiting period.<PRTPAGE P="562"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Amount payable.</E> The gross amount of sickness benefits for any registration period in a period of continuing sickness shall be computed by multiplying the number of compensable days of sickness in such registration period by the employee's daily benefit rate, as computed under part 330 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This subpart explains how long a qualified employee may receive normal unemployment or sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act during a benefit year. Under section 2(c) of that Act, normal unemployment benefits are payable for up to 130 days of unemployment within a benefit year, or in an amount equal to the amount of the employee's “base year compensation”, whichever is less. A similar limitation applies to the payment of sickness benefits. An employee who exhausts his or her normal unemployment or sickness benefits may be eligible for payment of extended unemployment or extended sickness benefits under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms “benefit year”, “base year”, and “compensation” are defined in part 302 of this chapter. The term “registration period” is defined in parts 325 and 335 of this chapter. For the purposes of this subpart, and as explained in § 336.4 of this part, an employee's “base year compensation” may include compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) even though such excess may not be counted for the purpose of determining whether such employee is a “qualified employee” within the meaning of part 302.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Recovery of benefits.</E> When unemployment or sickness benefits are recovered by the Board for one or more days, the Board will disregard those days in determining whether the employee has exhausted normal unemployment or sickness benefits with respect to the applicable benefit year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration of normal unemployment benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">130 compensable day limitation.</E> A qualified employee who has satisfied the waiting period for a benefit year may receive benefits for a maximum of 130 days of unemployment within such benefit year, subject to the limitation on payment explained in paragraph (b) of this section. In any registration period beginning after the end of the waiting period and before the beginning of the next ensuing benefit year, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of four, but the aggregate number of compensable days may not exceed 130 for the benefit year. An employee who is unemployed on all days during a registration period could have a maximum of 10 compensable days of unemployment in such registration period. The amount of benefits for each compensable day of unemployment is the amount of the daily benefit rate computed for such employee pursuant to part 330 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Base year compensation limit.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will not pay unemployment benefits to a qualified employee, with respect to his <PRTPAGE P="563"/>or her days of unemployment within a benefit year, in an amount greater than the amount of his or her base year compensation, as computed under § 336.4 of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unemployment due to a strike.</E> The limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to an employee whose unemployment is due to a stoppage of work because of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which he was last employed. But no unemployment benefits are payable for the employee's first 14 days of unemployment due to such stoppage of work.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration of normal sickness benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The duration of normal sickness benefits is the same as the duration of normal unemployment benefits, as set forth in § 336.2 of this part. A qualified employee who has satisfied the benefit year waiting period and is otherwise eligible for sickness benefits may receive benefits for a maximum of 130 days of sickness within a benefit year, but the amount paid as sickness benefits may not exceed the amount of the employee's base year compensation, as computed under § 336.4 of this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 336.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Base year compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Formula.</E> For the purposes of this part, an employee's base year compensation includes any compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) for any month in the applicable base year but shall not include any amount that exceeds the value of “X” in the following formula: X = $775(A/$600). In this formula, “A” is the dollar amount of the monthly compensation base with respect to months in such base year. For example, if an employee had railroad earnings of $1,500 per month in each of three months in base year 1990, the employee's base year compensation for purposes of part 302 of this chapter would be $2,235 (three times the monthly compensation base of $745 per month for months in 1990). But the employee's base year compensation for purposes of computing maximum normal unemployment (or sickness) benefits under this subpart would be $2,886 (three times $962), and his or her normal unemployment (or sickness) benefits would not be considered exhausted until he or she is paid unemployment (or sickness) benefits in an amount equal to $2,886. In this example, $962 is the amount computed as the value of “X” in the above formula when “A” is equal to $745.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Employer's duty to report.</E> The base year employer(s) of an employee shall provide information as to the amount of an employee's monthly compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base, as defined in part 302 of this chapter, unless the amount of the employee's compensation at the monthly compensation base limit, as already reported to the Board, is equal to or greater than an amount equal to 130 times the daily benefit rate applicable to the employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness.</P>

              <P>The Board will notify an employee when it appears that his or her right to normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits will be exhausted. Such notice will include information about the availability of extended benefits under subpart B of this part if the employee has completed 10 years of railroad service and the availability of normal benefits for the next ensuing benefit year if the employee is not eligible for extended benefits.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> For the purposes of this part, an employee is not eligible for extended unemployment or sickness benefits if he or she does not have at least 10 years of railroad service. An employee who has 120 service months, as defined in part 210 of this chapter, whether or not consecutive, is considered to have 10 years of railroad service.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The Board will determine whether an employee has 10 years of railroad service on the basis of reports filed by employers pursuant to part 209 of this chapter. The number of years of service shown in the Board's records will be accepted as correct for the purposes of this part, unless the employee claims credit for more service than that shown in the Board's records and such additional service is verified, subject to part 211 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Extended benefit period.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Defined.</E> An extended benefit period consists of seven consecutive 14-day registration periods.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Beginning date.</E> In the case of unemployment benefits, an extended benefit period begins with the first day of unemployment after the day on which the employee exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment benefits. In the case of sickness benefits, the beginning date is the first day of sickness after the employee exhausts normal sickness benefits. Such first day of unemployment or first day of sickness must be within the same benefit year with respect to which the employee exhausted normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits, as the case may be. However, no extended benefit period may begin on any day of unemployment or sickness prior to the date on which the employee acquired 10 years of railroad service.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ending date.</E> An employee's extended benefit period ends on the 97th day after it began. If an employee attains age 65 during an extended sickness benefit period, such extended benefit period will terminate on the day next preceding the date on which the employee attains age 65, except that it may continue for the purpose of paying <PRTPAGE P="565"/>benefits for his or her days of unemployment, if any, during such extended period. If an extended sickness benefit period terminates because the employee has attained age 65, and if at that point the employee has rights to normal sickness benefits, the employee will be paid normal sickness benefits if he or she is otherwise entitled to payment thereof.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum number of compensable days.</E> Extended benefits may be paid for a maximum of 65 days of unemployment (or 65 days of sickness, as the case may be) within an employee's extended benefit period.</P>

            <EXTRACT>
              <P>If the Board finds that at any time more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to any individual under this Act or a payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto (including payments made prior to July 1, 1940) recovery by adjustments in subsequent payments to which such individual is entitled under this Act or any other Act administered by the Board may, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, be made under regulations prescribed by the Board. If such individual dies before recovery is completed, recovery may be made by setoff or adjustments, under regulations prescribed by the Board, in subsequent payments due, under this Act or any other Act administered by the Board to the estate, designee, next of kin, legal representative, or surviving spouse of such individual, with respect to the employment of such individual.</P>
              <P>Adjustments under this subsection may be made either by deductions from subsequent payments or, with respect to payments which are to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes, by subtracting the total amount of benefits paid in excess of the proper amount from the actuarial value, as determined by the Board, of such payments to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes and recertifying such payments on the basis of the reduced actuarial value. In the latter case recovery shall be deemed to have been completed upon such recertification.</P>

              <P>There shall be no recovery in any case in which more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to an individual or payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto (including payments made prior to July 1, 1940) who, in the judgment of <PRTPAGE P="566"/>the Board, is without fault when, in the judgment of the Board, recovery would be contrary to the purpose of this Act or would be against equity or good conscience.</P>
              <P>No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him in good faith to any person where the recovery of such amount is waived under the third paragraph of this subsection or has been begun but cannot be completed under the first paragraph of this subsection.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recovery by adjustment in connection with subsequent payments under the Railroad Retirement Act.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Recovery under this part may be made by permanently reducing the amount of any annuity payable to the overpaid individual (or an individual receiving an annuity based upon the same compensation record as that of the overpaid individual) under the Railroad Retirement Act. This method of recovery is called an actuarial adjustment of the annuity. The Board cannot require any individual to take an actuarial adjustment in order to recover an overpayment nor is an actuarial adjustment available as a matter of right. An actuarial adjustment does not become effective until the overpaid individual negotiates the first annuity check which reflects the annuity rate after actuarial adjustment.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
              <P>An individual agrees to recovery of a $5,000 overpayment made to him by actuarial adjustment to an annuity awarded him under the Railroad Retirement Act. However, he dies before negotiating the first annuity check reflecting his actuarially reduced rate. The $5,000 is not considered recovered.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 340.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Waiver of recovery of erroneous payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">When waiver of recovery may be applied.</E> Section 2(d) of the Act provides that there shall be no recovery in any case where more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to an individual or where payment has been made to an individual not entitled to benefits if, in the judgment of the Board:</P>
            <P>(1) The individual is without fault; and</P>
            <P>(2) Recovery would be contrary to the purpose of the Act or would be against equity or good conscience.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fault.</E> (1) Fault means a defect of judgment or conduct arising from inattention or bad faith. Judgment or conduct is defective when it deviates from a prudent standard of care taken to comply wih the entitlement provisions of the Act. Conduct includes both action and inaction. Unlike fraud, fault does not require a deliberate intent to deceive.</P>

            <P>(2) Whether an individual is at fault in causing erroneous payments generally depends on all circumstances surrounding the erroneous payments. Among the factors the Board will consider are: the ability of the overpaid individual to understand the reporting requirements of the Act or to realize that he or she is being overpaid (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, age, comprehension, memory, physical and mental condition); the particular cause of benefit non-entitlement; and the number of claims on which the individual made erroneous statements.</P>
            <P>(3) Circumstances in which the Board will find an individual at fault include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Failure to furnish information which the individual knew or should have known was material;</P>
            <P>(ii) An incorrect statement made by the individual which he or she knew or should have known was incorrect (including furnishing an opinion or conclusion when asked for facts);</P>
            <P>(iii) Failure to return a payment which the individual knew or should have known was incorrect.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When recovery defeats the purpose of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance <PRTPAGE P="569"/>Act.</E> (1) The purpose of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is to furnish some replacement for an individual's railroad earnings lost because of days of sickness or unemployment. The purpose of the Act is defeated when an erroneous payment is recovered from income and resources which the individual requires to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses. If either income or resources are sufficient to meet expenses, the purpose of the Act is not defeated by recovery of an erroneous payment.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this section, income includes any funds which may reasonably be considered available for the individual's use, regardless of source. Income to the individual's spouse or dependents is available if the spouse or dependent lived with the individual at the time waiver is considered. Types of income include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Government benefits such as Black Lung, Social Security, Workers' Compensation, and Unemployment Compensation benefits;</P>
            <P>(ii) Wages and self-employment income;</P>
            <P>(iii) Regular payments such as rent or pensions; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Investment income.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of this section, resources include, but are not limited to, liquid assets such as cash on hand, the value of stocks, bonds, savings accounts, mutual funds, any accrual benefit payable by the United States of America or any other source.</P>
            <P>(4) Whether an individual has sufficient income and resources to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses depends not only on the amount of his or her income and resources, but also on whether the expenses are “ordinary and necessary.” While the level of expenses which is “ordinary and necessary” may vary between individuals, it must be held at a level reasonable for an individual who is temporarily unemployed or incapacitated due to sickness. The Board will consider the discretionary nature of an expense in determining whether it is reasonable. Ordinary and necessary living expenses include:</P>

            <P>(i) Fixed living expenses, such as food and clothing, rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, insurance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> life, accident, and health insurance), taxes, installment payments, etc.;</P>
            <P>(ii) Medical, hospitalization, and other similar expenses;</P>
            <P>(iii) Expenses for the support of others for whom the individual is legally responsible; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Miscellaneous expenses (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> newspapers, haircuts).</P>
            <P>(5) Where recovery of the full amount of an erroneous payment would be made from income and resources required to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses, but recovery of a lesser amount would leave income or resources sufficient to meet expenses, recovery of the lesser amount does not defeat the purpose of the Act.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When recovery is against equity or good conscience.</E> Recovery is considered to be against equity or good conscience when a person, in reliance on such payments or on notice that such payment would be made, relinquished a valuable right or changed his or her position for the worse.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Recoveries not subject to waiver.</E> (1) Where an amount is recoverable pursuant to section 2(f) of the Act from remuneration payable to an employee by a person or company, or where a lien for reimbursement of sickness benefits has arisen pursuant to section 12(o) of the Act, and in either case recovery is sought from a person other than the employee, no right to waiver of recovery exists.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the amount recoverable is equal to or less than 10 times the current maximum daily benefit rate under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act it shall not be considered contrary to the purpose of the Act or against equity or good conscience to recover such payment. Consequently, the amount recoverable is not subject to waiver under this part.</P>

            <P>(3) Where the amount recoverable is the result of an overpayment of benefits payable under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act due to entitlement to annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act for the same days for which benefits were payable, and recovery of such overpayment may be made <PRTPAGE P="570"/>by offset against an accrual of the annuities, it shall not be considered contrary to the purpose of the Act or against equity or good conscience to recover the erroneous payment by offset against such accrual. Consequently, the amount recoverable is not subject to waiver under this part.</P>
            <P>(4) Where there exists accumulated Federal benefits payable by any executive agency of the United States, any amount recoverable which is equal to or less than the accumulated Federal benefits is not subject to waiver. Any amount recoverable which is greater than the identified accumulated Federal benefits may be considered for waiver in accordance with the provisions of this part and part 320 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Termination of sickness benefits due to a settlement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Sickness benefits payable to an eligible employee shall be paid without regard to whether any person or company may be liable for causing the employee's infirmity. However, the Board will terminate the payment of sickness benefits upon receipt of an oral or written report that a settlement or final judgment for the infirmity has been made. A railroad employer may file the required report by sending an electronic message in the manner prescribed by the agency.</P>
            <P>(b) A report of settlement shall be made to the Sickness and Unemployment Benefits Section and shall include the information required in § 341.6. Where the report is an oral report, and the informant is neither the employee nor his or her representative, the informant shall be told that written confirmation containing the information called for by § 341.6 must be submitted to the Board within 5 days from the date of the oral report. A railroad employer may fulfill the written report requirement by sending an electronic message in the manner prescribed by the agency.</P>
            <P>(c) If, in the case of an oral report, the written confirmation as described in paragraph (b) of this section is not received within five days, the Sickness and Unemployment Benefits Section shall take steps within five additional working days to verify whether there has been a settlement or final judgment. If there has been no settlement or final judgment, the payment of sickness benefits shall be reinstated.</P>
            <P>(d) Within five days of the notification of a settlement or final judgment, the Board shall inform the employee of the report of the settlement or final judgment. The notice to the employee shall state how the employee may inform the Board that there has not been a settlement or final judgment. If the employee states that there has not been a settlement or final judgment, the adjudicating office shall, within 10 days after the receipt of such a statement, make a determination as to the employee's rights to future sickness benefits and shall notify him or her accordingly.</P>
            <P>(e) An employee shall have the right to appeal from the determination of the amount of sickness benefits recoverable from the settlement or judgment.</P>
            <FP>An employee shall also have the right to appeal the termination of his or her sickness benefits after the report of a settlement or final judgment made in accordance with the procedures provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section. Such appeals shall be filed and processed in accordance with part 320 of these regulations.</FP>

The Board's right of reimbursement under section 12(o) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act shall not be construed as giving the Board a right of subrogation or other cause of action for damages against an alleged tortfeasor. The Board shall intervene in such an action only when it is apparent that intervention may be required to protect its right of reimbursement.</P>
            <P>(c) The Board shall not be liable for the payment of any attorney's fee or other expenses incurred in connection with such a claim for damages.</P>

              <P>Every employer, as defined in part 301 of this chapter, shall pay to the Railroad Retirement Board a contribution with respect to the compensation paid to an employee in any calendar month for service by such employee (except for service to a local lodge or division of a railway labor organization). For the purposes of this part, the term “compensation” is defined in part 302 of this chapter. The compensation subject to contribution is the gross amount of compensation paid to an employee for service in any month, not to exceed the amount of the monthly compensation base (MCB), as defined in part 302 of this chapter. The amount of contribution payable by each employer is to be computed and paid pursuant to the provisions of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Each employer (other than a subordinate unit of a national-railway-labor-organization employer) shall be liable for that portion of the contribution with respect to such compensation paid by all such employers which the compensation paid by the employer to such employee bears to the total compensation paid in such month by all such employers to such employee.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event that the compensation paid by such employers to the employee in such month is less than the MCB, each subordinate unit of a national-railway-labor-organization employer shall be liable for such portion of any additional contribution as the compensation paid by such employer to such employee in such month bears to the total compensation paid by all national-railway-labor-organization employers to such employee in such month.</P>

              <P>(2) If the date prescribed for filing the report or paying the contribution is a date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period that terminates with the date numerically corresponding thereto in the succeeding calendar month and each such successive period shall constitute a month. If, in the month of February, there is no date corresponding to the date prescribed for filing the report or paying, the period from such date in January through the last day of February shall constitute a month. Thus, if a report is due on January 30, the first month shall end on February 28 (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding months shall end on March 30, April 30, etc.</P>
              <P>(3) If a report is not timely filed or a contribution is not timely paid, the fact that the date prescribed for filing the report or paying the contribution, or the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday is immaterial in determining the number of months.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reference to forms.</E> Any reference in this part to any prescribed reporting or other form of the Board includes a reference to any other form of the Board prescribed in substitution for such prescribed form.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Showing reasonable cause.</E> For purposes of this part if an employer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time, then the delay is due to reasonable cause. A failure to pay any amount due under this part within the prescribed time will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent that the employer has made a satisfactory showing that he exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment but nevertheless was unable to pay on time.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compensation adjustment.</E> A compensation adjustment is the amount of any adjustment reported by an employer on Form BA-4. See part 209 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustment of contributions.</E> (1) All adjustments of contributions based on compensation adjustments shall be accounted for by the employer on the contribution report for the same quarter in which the Form BA-4 reflecting the compensation adjustments is filed with the Board.</P>
              <P>(2) If less than the correct amount of contributions is paid for any previous calendar quarter or calendar year because of an error that does not constitute a compensation adjustment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall adjust the error by—</P>

              <P>(ii) Paying the amount thereof to the Board at the time such report is filed.</P>

              <P>(3) If more than the correct amount of contributions is paid for any previous calendar quarter or calendar year because of an error that does not constitute a compensation adjustment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall adjust the error by applying the excess payment as a credit against the contribution due on the <PRTPAGE P="578"/>next report filed after discovery of the error. However, if the overpayment cannot be adjusted because the employer is no longer required to file a report or because the overpayment to be adjusted exceeds the amount of contribution due on the employer's next report, the employer may file for a refund of the amount which cannot be adjusted as provided for in this section. If the overpayment is the result of an incorrect contribution rate as determined by the Board, the employer may file for a refund of the amount of overpayment or may take an adjustment as provided for in this section.</P>

Any underpayment not adjusted within the time limits as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall be adjusted on the employer's next contribution report or reported immediately on a supplemental return. Interest shall accrue on such underpayment as provided for in § 345.122 of this part from the time the adjustment should have been made under paragraph (c) of this section to date of payment. However, no underpayment shall be adjusted under this section after the receipt from the Board of formal notice and demand.</P>

              <P>(b) The amount of any such assessment will be collected in accordance with the applicable provisions of law. If any employer liable to pay any contribution neglects or refuses to pay the same within ten days after notice and demand, the Board may collect such contribution with such interest and <PRTPAGE P="579"/>other additional amounts as are required by law, by levy, by administrative offset as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 367 of this chapter, or by a proceeding in court, but only if the levy is made or proceeding begun:</P>

              <P>(a) Whenever in the opinion of the Board it becomes necessary to protect the interests of the Government by effecting an immediate reporting and collection of an employer's contribution, the Board will assess the contribution whether or not the time otherwise prescribed by law for filing the contribution report and paying such contribution has expired, together with all penalties and interest thereon. Upon assessment, such contribution, and any penalty, and interest provided for under this part shall be immediately due and payable, and the Board shall thereupon issue immediately a notice and demand for payment of the contribution, penalty, and interest.</P>
              <P>(b) The collection of the whole or any part of the amount of the jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the Board a bond in an amount equal to the amount with respect to which the stay is desired, and with such sureties as the Board may deem necessary. Such bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest and any penalties thereon) the collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but for the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. In lieu of surety or sureties the employer may deposit with the Board bonds or notes of the United States, or bonds or notes fully guaranteed by the United States as to principal and interest, having a par value not less than the amount of the bond required to be furnished, together with an agreement authorizing the Board in case of default to collect or sell such bonds or notes so deposited.</P>

Interest on past due contributions from the due date thereof until the date paid will be assessed after payment of the contributions, and notice and demand made upon the employer for payment thereof, in any case in which payment of the contribution is made before assessment under § 345.120.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiver of interest.</E> The Chief Financial Officer may waive, in whole or in part, any interest imposed by paragraph (a) of this section if in his or her judgment—</P>
              <P>(1) There was a reasonable cause and not willful neglect for the late filing, late payment or underpayment, such as: the serious illness or death of an individual with the sole authority to execute the return and payment; fire, casualty, or natural disaster at the place where the railroad unemployment insurance records are kept; or reasons outside the employer's control, such as, the failure of the employer's bank to comply with the employer's filing and payment instructions;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Effective January 1, 1993, each employer that is subject to this part will have an experience-rated rate of contribution computed as set forth in § 345.303 of this part. A transitional rate of contribution applies to each such employer for 1991 and 1992, in accordance with section 8(a)(1)(B) of the RUIA. An employer that first becomes subject to section 8 of the RUIA after December 31, 1989 will have a “new-employer” contribution rate as computed in § 345.304 of this part. An employer's experience-rated contribution rate will be not less than 0.65 percent nor more than 12.5 percent. Not later than October 15 of each year, the Board will notify each employer of its experience-rated contribution rate for the following calendar year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Components of an experience-rated contribution rate.</E> An employer's experience-rated contribution rate for each calendar year beginning with 1993 will be based upon the following charges:</P>
              <P>(1) An allocated charge based upon the amount of benefits paid to employees of such employer; this charge is explained in subpart E of this part;</P>

              <P>(2) An unallocated charge based upon a proportionate share of the system <PRTPAGE P="583"/>unallocated charge balance, the computation of which is explained in § 345.302(p) of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) A pooled charge, also referred to as risk-sharing, to cover the cost of benefit payments that are chargeable to a base year employer but are not captured by the contribution rate assigned to such employer because it is paying contributions at the maximum rate of contribution; the formula for computing the pooled charge is set forth in § 345.302(j) of this part;</P>
              <P>(4) A surcharge of 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 percent, or a pooled credit, depending on the balance to the credit of the Account as of June 30 of a given year; and</P>
              <P>(5) An addition of 0.65 percent to the rate of contribution to cover the expenses incurred by the Board in administering the RUIA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Maximum rate of contribution.</E> Notwithstanding any provision of this part, an employer's contribution rate for any calendar year shall be limited to 12 percent, except when a surcharge of 3.5 percent is in effect with respect to that calendar year. If a 3.5 percent surcharge is in effect, the maximum contribution limit with respect to that calendar year is 12.5 percent. The surcharge rate for a calendar year will be 3.5 percent when the balance to the credit of the Account is less than zero. The Board will compute the surcharge rate in accordance with § 345.302(n) of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definition of terms and phrases used in experience-rating.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Account.</E> The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account established by section 10 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) and maintained by the Secretary of the Treasury in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act. Benefits paid under the RUIA for an employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness are paid from this Account.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Benefit ratio.</E> This ratio is computed for each employer as of any given June 30 by dividing all benefits charged to the employer under subpart E of this part during the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30 by the employer's three-year compensation base as of such June 30, as computed under paragraph (q) of this section. The ratio is computed to four decimal places.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Benefits.</E> Benefits are money payments paid or payable by the Board to a qualified employee with respect to his or her days of unemployment or days of sickness, as provided by the RUIA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Compensation.</E> This term has the meaning given in part 302 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Contributions.</E> Contributions are the money payments paid or payable by an employer subject to this part with respect to the compensation paid or payable to employees of such employer.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Cumulative benefit balance.</E> An employer's cumulative benefit balance as of any given June 30 is determined by adding:</P>
              <P>(1) The net amount of the benefits charged to the employer under subpart E on or after January 1, 1990, and</P>
              <P>(2) The cumulative amount of the employer's unallocated charges on and after January 1, 1990, as computed under paragraph (r) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Fund.</E> The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund established by section 11 of the RUIA and maintained by the Secretary of the Treasury in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act. The costs incurred by the Board in administering the RUIA are paid from the Fund.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Net cumulative contribution balance.</E> The Board will determine an employer's net cumulative contribution balance as of any given June 30, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Compute the sum of all contributions paid by the employer pursuant to this part after December 31, 1989; add that portion of the tax, if any, imposed under 26 U.S.C. 3321(a) that is attributable to the surtax rate under section 7106(b) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and Retirement Improvement Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-647) and any repayment taxes paid by the employer pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 3321(a) after the outstanding balance of loans made under section 10(d) of the RUIA before October 1, 1985, plus interest, has been paid;<PRTPAGE P="584"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Subtract an amount equal to the amount of such contributions deposited, pursuant to section 8(i) of the RUIA, to the credit of the Fund; and</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Add an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which such contributions were reduced in prior calendar years as a result of pooled credits, if any, under paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">One-year compensation base.</E> An employer's one-year compensation base is the aggregate amount of compensation with respect to which the employer is liable for contributions under this part in the four calendar quarters ending on such June 30.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Pooled charge ratio.</E> The pooled charge ratio, when applicable, is a pro-rata increase in the rate of contribution assigned to each employer that is not already paying contributions at the maximum rate. A pooled charge will become applicable to each such employer during a calendar year when the Account loses income because one or more other employers are paying contributions at the maximum rate (12 or 12.5 percent) rather than at the higher experience-based rate that their benefit charges would otherwise require. The pooled charge ratio thus picks up the cost of benefits paid to employees of employers whose rate of contribution is capped at the maximum rate. The pooled charge ratio for a calendar year is the same for all employers whose rate is less than the maximum and is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> For each employer paying contributions at the maximum contribution limit under § 345.301(c) of this part, compute the amount of contributions that such employer would have paid if its experience-based rate were applied to its one-year compensation base as of the preceding June 30 and by then deducting from such amount the amount derived by applying the maximum contribution rate to the same one-year compensation base. For the purposes of this computation, the experience-based rate is the rate computed for such employer under § 345.303 of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> After the amount is computed for each employer in accordance with Step 1 of this paragraph (j), add the amounts for all such employers. The aggregate amount so computed represents the amount of contributions not collected by the Account because of the maximum contribution limit.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> For each employer whose experience-based rate of contribution, as computed at Step 3 of § 345.303(a) of this part, is less than zero, the percentage rate by which the employer's rate was raised in order to bring that rate to the minimum rate of zero is multiplied by the employer's 1-year compensation base. The total of the amounts so computed is subtracted from the aggregate amount computed in Step 2 of this paragraph (j).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Step 4.</E> Divide the net aggregate amount computed at Step 3 of this paragraph (j) by the system compensation base as of the preceding June 30, excluding from such base the one-year compensation base of each employer whose experience-based contribution rate, computed at Step 6 of § 345.303(a) of this part, exceeds the maximum contribution limit. The result is the pooled charge ratio for the current calendar year. This ratio is computed to four decimal places.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Pooled credit ratio.</E> Effective January 1, 1991, and on the first of each subsequent calendar year, the Board will reduce each employer's rate of contribution, as computed under § 345.303 of this part, by the amount of the pooled credit ratio, if any, applicable to such calendar year. This ratio is computed by reference to the accrual balance to the credit of the Account as of the preceding June 30. The Board will determine the amount of the pooled credit ratio, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> First, the Board computes the accrual balance to the credit of the Account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30 in the same manner as under Step 1 of paragraph (n) of this section. There will be a pooled credit ratio for the calendar year if that balance is in excess of the greater of $250 million or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $250 million as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="585"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> If there is such an excess amount, divide that excess amount by the system compensation base as of the June 30 preceding the calendar year. The result is the pooled credit ratio applicable to each employer for the calendar year involved in the computation. This ratio is computed to four decimal places.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Reserve balance.</E> An employer's reserve balance is computed as of any given June 30 by subtracting its cumulative benefit balance as of such June 30 from its net cumulative contribution balance as of such June 30. An employer's net cumulative benefit balance is computed under paragraph (f) of this section and its net cumulative contribution balance under paragraph (h) of this section. An employer's reserve balance may be either positive or negative, depending upon whether its net cumulative contribution balance exceeds its cumulative benefit balance.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Reserve ratio.</E> This ratio is computed for each employer as of any given June 30 by dividing its reserve balance as of June 30 by its one-year compensation base as of such June 30. An employer's reserve balance is computed under paragraph (l) of this section and its one-year compensation base under paragraph (i) of this section. This ratio is computed to four decimal places; it may be either a positive or negative figure, depending on whether the employer's reserve balance is a positive or negative figure.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Surcharge rate.</E> Effective January 1, 1991, and on the first of each subsequent calendar year, the Board will add to each employer's rate of contribution, as computed under § 345.303 of this part, a surcharge rate of 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 percent if the accrual balance to the credit of the Account, as of the preceding June 30, falls within the range of balances set forth in Steps 1 and 2 of this paragraph (n). The Board will determine which surcharge rate, if any, is in effect for a calendar year by means of the following computation:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> First, the Board computes the accrual balance to the credit of the Account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30. Such balance will include any amounts in the Account attributable to loans made under section 10(d) of the Act before October 1, 1985, but not the obligation of the Account to repay such loans with interest. For this purpose, the Account will be deemed to include any balance to the credit of the Fund that exceeds $6 million. The surcharge rate, as specified in Step 2 of this paragraph (n), will apply if that balance is less than the greater of $100 million or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $100 million as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> If the balance to the credit of the Account is less than the greater of the amounts referred to in the last sentence of Step 1 of this paragraph (n), but is equal to or more than the greater of $50 million or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $50 million as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, then the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 1.5 percent. If the balance to the credit of the Account is less than the greater of the amounts referred to in this Step 2, but greater than or equal to zero, then the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 2.5 percent. If the balance to the credit of the Account is less than zero, the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 3.5 percent.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">System compensation base.</E> The system compensation base as of June 30 of each year is the total of the amounts of the one-year compensation bases of all base year employers, computed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. Not later than October 15 of each year, the Board will compute the amount of the system compensation base and will publish notice of such amount in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as soon as practicable thereafter.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">System unallocated charge balance.</E> This balance, as computed initially for the period January 1 through June 30, 1990 and updated as of June 30 of each subsequent calendar year, represents the net amount of expenditures from, and income to, the Account that cannot be allocated as benefit charges, or adjustments, to the cumulative benefit <PRTPAGE P="586"/>balances of individual base year employers. The Board computes this balance, as of June 30 of each year, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Compute the aggregate amount of all interest paid by the Account on loans from the Railroad Retirement Account after September 30, 1985, pursuant to section 10(d) of the RUIA, during the 12-month period ending on June 30;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Add the amount of unemployment benefits paid by reason of strikes or work stoppages growing out of labor disputes and the cumulative benefit balance of any defunct employer;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Add the aggregate amount of any other benefit payment that is not chargeable to a base year employer pursuant to subpart E of this part and any other expenditure not chargeable to the Fund;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Step 4.</E> Subtract the aggregate amount of income to the Account received as a proportionate part of the earnings of the unemployment trust fund, computed in accordance with section 904(e) of the Social Security Act, and all income to the Account received as fines or penalties collected under the RUIA;</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Step 5.</E> Subtract the aggregate amount of all transfers from the Fund to the Account pursuant to section 11(d) of the RUIA;</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Step 6.</E> Subtract the aggregate amount of any other cash receipt to the Account that cannot be treated as an adjustment to the benefit charges of a base year employer;</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Step 7.</E> Subtract the net cumulative contribution balance of any defunct employer, calculated as of the date on which the Board determines that such employer is defunct. After the Board has computed the amount of the system unallocated charge balance as of June 30 of each year, the Board will publish notice of such amount in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on or before October 15 of such year.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Three-year compensation base.</E> An employer's three-year compensation base as of any given June 30 is the aggregate amount of compensation with respect to which the employer is liable for contributions under this part in the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Unallocated charge.</E> An employer's unallocated charge as of any given June 30 is the amount that, as of such June 30, bears the same ratio to the system unallocated charge balance as the employer's 1-year compensation base bears to the system compensation base. The system unallocated charge balance is computed under paragraph (p) of this section and the system compensation base under paragraph (o) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) An employer whose coverage under the RUIA becomes effective after December 31, 1989, is considered a “new employer” for the purposes of this part and will be assigned a contribution rate as computed under this section. The Board shall determine where an employer is a new employer and, if so, the effective date of its coverage under the RUIA and its rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid to employees on and after such effective date.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial contribution rate.</E> The rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid in calendar months before the end of the first full calendar year that the employer is subject to this section shall be the average contribution rate paid by all employers during the three calendar years preceding the calendar year before the calendar year in which the compensation is paid. The Board will compute the average contribution rate by dividing the aggregate contributions paid by all employers during those three calendar years by the aggregate compensation with respect to which such contributions were paid and by then multiplying the resulting ratio, as computed to four decimal points, by 100.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Second contribution rate.</E> The rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid in months in the second full calendar year shall be the smaller of the maximum contribution limit under the RUIA or the percentage rate computed as follows:</P>

              <P>Effective January 1, 1990, all benefits paid to an employee for his or her days of unemployment or days of sickness will be charged to the base year employer of such employee, except as hereinafter provided in this part. The Board will make the charge by adding the gross amount of the benefits payable to an employee on the basis of a claim for benefits to that employee's base year employer's cumulative benefit balance. The benefit charge does not depend on whether the employee receiving the benefit payment is a current employee of the base year employer.</P>

              <P>If benefits are payable to an employee for days of unemployment resulting from a strike or work stoppage growing out of a labor dispute, the Board will charge the benefit payment to the system unallocated charge balance, not to the cumulative benefit balance of the employee's base year employer. For the purposes of this section, the phrase “strike or work stoppage growing out of a labor dispute” does not include an employee's protected refusal to work under section 212(b) of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 441(b)).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules for benefit charging.</E> All benefits paid to an employee who had more than one base year employer shall be charged to the cumulative benefit balances of such employers, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the employer at the time of the claim is the same as the last employer in the base year, benefits will be charged in reverse chronological order, but the amount charged to each base year employer shall not exceed the amount of compensation paid by such employer to the employee in the base year;</P>
              <P>(2) In all other cases, benefits will be charged in the same ratio as the compensation paid to such employee by the employer bears to the total of such compensation paid to such employee by all such employers in the base year; benefit charging in accordance with this method shall apply whether the base year employment was with successive employers or with concurrent employers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Excess benefit payments.</E> If, in applying the rule in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, there remain benefit payments, in whole or in part, that cannot be charged to any base year employer, the amount of benefits paid in excess of those chargeable under paragraph (a)(1) shall be charged to the system unallocated charge balance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Board records as basis for charging multiple base year employers.</E> Where an employee has more than one base year employer, the Board will use records compiled on the basis of employer reports filed under § 345.110 of this part for the purpose of determining whether the employer at the time of the claim for benefits is the last employer in the base year and for other purposes related to benefit charging under this subpart. If, in a particular case, such records do not contain all the data necessary to determine the charge, the Board will request the necessary data from the base year employers who may be liable for the charge.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recovery of benefits charged to base year employer.</E> Where the Board recovers a benefit payment that it had previously charged, in whole or in part, to one or more base year employers, the Board will subtract the amount of the recovery from the cumulative benefit <PRTPAGE P="590"/>balances of the employers of the employee to whom such amount was paid as a benefit in proportion to the amount by which each such employer's cumulative benefit balance was increased as a result of the payment of the benefit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Recovery of other benefit payments.</E> Where the Board recovers a benefit payment that was not charged, in whole or in part, to any base year employer, or was made before January 1, 1990, the Board will treat the amount of the recovery as a subtraction from the system unallocated charge balance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of interest or other debt collection-related charges.</E> The Board will not adjust a base year employer's cumulative benefit balance to reflect payment by a debtor of interest or other charges assessed by the Board under § 200.7 of this chapter with respect to the collection of a debt arising from a benefit payment charged to such employer and later found to be recoverable by the Board.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> The Board will adjust a base year employer's cumulative benefit balance only when the Board actually recovers, by cash payment or setoff, a debt that represents a benefit payment that was charged, in whole or in part, to such employer. No adjustment shall be made—</P>
              <P>(1) If the Board waives recovery of a debt in accordance with part 340 of this chapter, or</P>
              <P>(2) If the Board finds that a debt is uncollectible, or</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Prepayment notification.</E> When the Board receives an employee's claim for unemployment or sickness benefits, the Board will give the employee's base year employer notice of the claim and an opportunity to provide information to the Board with respect to the employee's eligibility for benefits for the period of time covered by the claim.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of claim determination.</E> After the base year employer has had an opportunity to provide information in accordance with the prepayment notification process described in paragraph (a) of this section, the office of the Board that is adjudicating the employee's claim for benefits will determine whether to pay or to deny benefits on the claim. Such office will send notice to the base year employer showing what determination was made on the claim. If benefits are found to be payable, the amount of the payment will be charged to the cumulative benefit balance of the base year employer in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. If the base year employer disagrees with the payment of benefits, it may request reconsideration in accordance with part 320 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(1) The total amount of unemployment and sickness benefit payments made after December 31, 1989, that have been charged to the employer as the base year employer of the employees who received the benefits; minus</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Explanation of representative payment.</E> This part explains the principles and procedures that the Board follows in determining whether to make representative payment and in selecting a representative payee. It also explains the responsibilities that a representative payee has concerning the use of the funds which he or she receives on behalf of a claimant. A representative payee may be either a person or an organization selected by the Board to receive benefits on behalf of a claimant. A representative payee will be selected if the Board believes that the interest of a claimant will be served by representative payment rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, the Board will appoint a representative payee if it determines that the claimant is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Statutory authority.</E> Section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, which is also applicable to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, provides that every claimant shall be conclusively presumed to have been competent until the date on which the Board receives a notice in writing that a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor has been appointed: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That despite receiving such notice, the Board may, if it finds the interests of such claimant to be served thereby, recognize actions by, conduct transactions with, and make payments to such claimant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.</E> (1) The Board's policy is that every claimant has the right to manage his or her own benefits. However, due to mental or physical condition some claimants may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of a claimant would be better served if benefit payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the claimant is a legally competent individual. If the claimant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.</P>
            <P>(2) If payment is being made directly to a claimant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the claimant has not been adjudged legally incompetent, continue to pay the claimant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reopening and revising decisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part sets forth the Board's rules governing finality of decisions with respect to benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. After the expiration of the time limits for review as set forth in part 320 of this chapter, decisions may be reopened and revised only under the conditions described in this subpart, by the bureau, office or entity that made the earlier decision or by a bureau, office, or other entity at a higher level which has the claim properly before it. Whether a final decision is reopened or not reopened is solely within the discretion of the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) A <E T="03">final decision,</E> as that term is used in this part, means any decision under § 320.5 of this chapter where the time limit for review, as set forth in part 320 of this chapter or in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, has expired.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reopening</E> a final decision under this part means a conscious determination on the part of the agency to reconsider an otherwise final decision for purposes of revising that decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">New and material evidence,</E> as that phrase is used in this part, means evidence which was unavailable to the agency at the time the decision was made, and which the claimant could not reasonably have been expected to have submitted at that time.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Conditions for reopening.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A final decision may be reopened:</P>
            <P>(a) Within 12 months of the date of the notice of such decision, for any reason;</P>
            <P>(b) Within four years of the date of the notice of such decision:</P>
            <P>(1) If there is new and material evidence; or</P>
            <P>(2) If the decision was not reasonably consistent with the evidence of record at the time of adjudication.</P>
            <P>(c) At any time if:</P>
            <P>(1) The decision was obtained by fraud or similar fault;</P>
            <P>(2) The decision was that the claimant was not a qualified employee, and he or she is now qualified because compensation was credited to the employee's record of compensation in accordance with part 211 of this chapter:</P>
            <P>(i) To correct errors apparent on the face of the compensation record;</P>
            <P>(ii) To enter items transferred by the Social Security Administration which were credited under the Social Security Act when they should have been credited to the employee's railroad retirement compensation record; or</P>
            <P>(iii) To correct errors made in the allocation of earnings to individuals or periods which would have made him or her a qualified employee at the time of the decision if the earnings had been credited to his or her earnings record at that time;</P>
            <P>(3) The decision is wholly or partially unfavorable to a claimant, but only to correct a clerical error or an error that appears on the face of the evidence that was considered when the decision was made.</P>

            <P>(a) A decision may be revised after the applicable time period in §§ 349.2(a) or (b) expires if the Board begins an investigation into whether to revise the decision before the applicable time period expires and the agency diligently pursues the investigation to the conclusion. The investigation may be based on a request by a claimant or on action by the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Diligently pursued</E> for purposes of this section means that in view of the facts and circumstances of a particular case, the necessary action was undertaken and carried out as promptly as the circumstances permitted. Diligent pursuit will be presumed to have been met if the investigation is concluded and, if necessary, the decision is revised within six months from the date the investigation began.</P>
            <P>(c) If the investigation is not diligently pursued to its conclusion, the decision will be revised if a revision is applicable and if it is favorable to the claimant. It will not be revised if it would be unfavorable to the claimant.</P>

The notice will state the basis for the revised decision and the effect of the revision. The notice will also inform the parties of the right to further review.</P>
            <P>(b) If a hearings officer or the three-member Board proposes to revise a decision, and the revision would be based only on evidence included in the record on which the prior decision was based, all parties will be notified in writing of the proposed action. If a revised decision is issued by a hearings officer, any party may request that it be reviewed by the three-member Board, or the three-member Board may review the decision on its own initiative.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authorization for garnishment of benefits paid by the Board.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Annuities and accrued annuities payable under the Railroad Retirement Act, sickness and unemployment benefits payable under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, and benefits payable under any other Act administered by the Board, are subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if the Board were a private person, to legal process brought for the enforcement of legal obligations to provide child support or to make alimony payments.</P>
            <P>(b) Lump sums, other than accrued annuities, which are payable under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, such as those payable under sections 6(b)(1) and 6(c)(1) of that Act, are not subject to legal process as defined in this subchapter. However, an individual entitled to a benefit under section 6 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 may assign the right to receive all or any part of that benefit.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as authorized under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and part 295 of this chapter, no benefit paid by the Board shall be assignable or be subject to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process, nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated.</P>
            <P>(d) In the absence of law to the contrary, it will be assumed that “wages,” “earnings,” and analogous terms referred to in relevant provisions of state law include payments made by a private person which are analogous to those paid by the Board.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 350.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Child support</E> means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a child or children; such term also includes attorney's fees, interest, and court costs, when and to the same extent that they are expressly made recoverable pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accordance with applicable state law by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Alimony</E> means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a spouse or former spouse and, subject to and in accord with state law, includes but is not limited to, separate maintenance, alimony pendente lite, maintenance, and spousal support; such term also includes attorney's fees, interest, and court costs, when and to the extent that they are expressly made recoverable pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accord with applicable State law by a court of competent jurisdiction. Alimony does not include any payment or transfer of property or of its value in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property, nor does it include any payment to an estate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Legal process</E> means any court order, summons, or other similar process, including administrative orders, in the nature of garnishment, which is directed to and the purpose of which is to compel the Board to make a payment from moneys which are otherwise payable to an individual, to another party in order to satisfy a legal obligation of such individual to provide child support or make alimony payments. For purposes of this subchapter, legal process additionally includes assignments in lieu of garnishment, but only where <PRTPAGE P="595"/>grounds for the issuance of legal process in the nature of garnishment exist. Such assignments are revocable.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Legal obligation</E> means an obligation to pay alimony or child support which is enforceable under appropriate state law.</P>
            <CITA>[45 FR 28314, Apr. 29, 1980, as amended at 53 FR 35807, Sept. 15, 1988]</CITA>

            <SECTNO>§ 350.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Service of legal process brought for the enforcement of an individual's obligation to provide child support or make alimony payments shall be accomplished by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, directed to the Deputy General Counsel of the Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, or by personal service upon the Deputy General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(b) Where the Deputy General Counsel is effectively served with legal process relating to an individual's legal obligation to provide child support or to make alimony payments, he shall, as soon as possible and not later than 15 days after the date of effective service of such process, send written notice that such process has been so served, together with a copy thereof, to the individual whose moneys are affected thereby; and, if response to such process is required, shall respond within 30 days, or within such longer period as may be prescribed by state law, after the date effective service is made. These requirements do not apply in the case of an assignment in lieu of garnishment or an assignment of a portion, attributable to the existence of the annuitant's family members, of a railroad retirement annuity computed under the social security minimum guaranty provision of the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>
            <P>(c) Included with the legal process issued to the Board should be the name of the individual against whom the legal obligation to provide child support or to make alimony payments is sought to be enforced and, if available, the individual's social security or railroad retirement number, the individual's address, and the type of benefit that the individual is receiving from the Board.</P>
            <P>(d) Legal process which refers to a payment in terms of a percentage of some other amount must also refer to that payment in terms of a specific amount or amounts. In connection with any legal process which does not refer to a payment in terms of a specific amount or amounts, the Board may compute the amount or may comply with that portion of the legal process which specifies an amount or amounts and withhold compliance with the balance of the process pending clarification from the issuing court or from the party which procured that process.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Unless a lower percentage or dollar amount limitation on garnishment is provided by applicable state or local law, the portion of any payment due to an individual which is subject to legal process to enforce any order for the support of any person shall not exceed 65 percent. Where the individual is supporting a spouse or dependent child, other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support that legal process is issued, the portion subject to legal process is reduced by 10 percent. Where the alimony or support arrearage is less than 12 weeks old, the portion subject to legal process is reduced by 5 percent. If a lower limitation is provided by applicable state or local law, then that lower limitation shall be applied.</P>
            <P>(b) In the absence of some evidence to the contrary, it will be assumed that the defendant is not supporting a spouse or dependent child other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support the legal process is issued.</P>
            <P>(c) In any case in which a recurring benefit payment is reduced, whether due to a recovery by the Board of an overpayment or for some other reason, below the rate at which it is ordinarily paid, any applicable exemptions shall be applied to the amount of the reduced benefit which is actually paid.</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of the applicability of exemptions, amounts deducted for medicare premiums must first be subtracted from the annuity amount.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Miscellaneous.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Board may not be required to vary its normal disbursement cycles in order to comply with legal process. However, legal process which is received too late to be honored during the disbursement cycle in which it is received may be honored to the extent that the legal process may, in compliance with this part, be satisfied from the next payment due to the obligor.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in these regulations, the Board may not be required in connection with proceedings under this part to forward documents which have been sent to the Board, to an individual, whether or not he is entitled to benefits paid by the Board, or to disclose information other than that relating to the type, amount (whether actual or estimated), and dates of payment of benefits paid by the Board to that individual.</P>
            <P>(c) Neither the Board nor any of its employees shall be liable with respect to any payment made to any individual from moneys due from or payable by the Board pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(d) No employee of the Board whose duties include responding to legal process pursuant to requirements contained in this part shall be subject under any law to any disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability or penalty for, or on account of, any disclosure of information made by such employee in connection with the performance of the employee's duties in responding to any such process.</P>
            <P>(e) For purposes of a proceeding under this part, the Board will apply the law of the state in which the legal process is issued unless it comes to the attention of the Board that the state of issuance has no contact with the plaintiff or defendant in the action; in which case, the Board may, in its sole discretion, apply the law of any state with significant interest in the matter.</P>
            <P>(f) No acknowledgement or response will be made to legal process which does not contain the mailing address to which acknowledgement may be made. No response to any legal process will be notarized or verified.</P>

            <SUBJECT>The hearing and burden of proof.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to determine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under § 355.3 and, if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors.</P>
            <P>(b) The authority shall prove defendant's liability and any aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
            <P>(c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
            <P>(d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for good cause shown.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and upon appeal, the authority head, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible <PRTPAGE P="608"/>costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>

            <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>
            <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
            <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>
            <P>(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
            <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
            <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
            <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
            <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
            <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
            <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
            <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
            <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
            <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
            <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a state, directly or indirectly; and</P>
            <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
            <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

            <P>(b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts <PRTPAGE P="609"/>shall be exchanged as provided in § 355.22(a).</P>
            <P>(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to—</P>

            <P>(2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and</P>

            <P>(e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</P>
            <P>(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of—</P>
            <P>(1) A party who is an individual;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party designated by the party's representative; or</P>

            <P>(d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires that civil monetary penalties be adjusted on an annual basis by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the month of October preceding the adjustment exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year prior to the October preceding the adjustment, with final amounts rounded to the nearest dollar. That Act also requires a one-time catch up adjustment in the amount of the percentage by which the CPI-U for October 2015 exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year during which the amount of civil monetary penalty was established or adjusted under a provision of law other than the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act.</P>
            <P>(b) Other than adjustments under the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, the Board last established or adjusted civil monetary penalties in 1986. The CPI-U increased by 215.628 percent between October 1986 and October 2015.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>These regulations, which implement 5 U.S.C. 5514, provide the standards and procedures which the Board will utilize to collect debts owed to the United States from the current pay accounts of its employees, including the current pay accounts of employees who owe debts to agencies other than the Board.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This part and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in recovering certain debts by administrative offset, except where the employee consents to the recovery, from the current pay account of an employee. Because it is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and these regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS).</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Excluded debts or claims.</E> The procedures contained in this part do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiver requests and claims to the U.S. General Accounting Office.</E> This part does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of recovery of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or any other similar provision of law, or from questioning the amount of validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the U.S. General Accounting Office.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Compromise, suspension, or termination under the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 101.1, et seq.).</E> Nothing in this part precludes the compromise, suspension or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards implementing 31 U.S.C. 3711, <E T="03">et seq.</E> (4 CFR 101.1, <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

            <P>The Board shall provide an employee written Notice of Intent to Offset Salary (Notice of Intent). The employee will be provided the notice at least thirty calendar days before the intended deduction is to begin. In addition, the notice must provide the following:</P>
            <P>(a) That the Board has reviewed the records relating to the claim and has determined that a debt is owed, and the origin, nature, and amount of that debt;</P>

            <P>(j) Advice that the timely filing of a petition for hearing or a request for waiver (if the waiver statute or regulations are not “permissive” in nature) will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for waiver or hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A request for waiver or for a hearing must be made in writing and received by the Chief Financial Officer no later than thirty calendar days after the notice is sent to the employee. This time limit may, at the discretion of the Chief Financial Officer, be extended if the employee can show that the delay was caused by circumstances which were beyond the employee's control or because of the employee's failure to receive notice of the time limit. Any right to waiver or to a hearing is forfeited unless the time limits set forth in this paragraph are complied with.</P>
            <P>(b) The employee's request for a hearing must be signed by the employee and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, which the employee believes support his or her position.</P>
            <P>(c) A request for a hearing under this paragraph is not a request for waiver. A request for waiver must state the basis for the request for waiver and whether a hearing is requested. If no request for a hearing is contained in the waiver request, no hearing will be provided.</P>

            <P>(d) A hearing, if requested, will be an informal proceeding conducted by an administrative law judge or hearing official not under the control of the Board.

            <P>Within thirty days after the hearing, the administrative law judge or hearing official shall issue a written decision stating the facts evidencing the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and the judge or hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions with respect to the employee's position on liability for the debt and with respect to his or her eligibility for waiver.

            <SUBJECT>Limitations on notice and hearing requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The procedural requirements of this part are not applicable to collections which result from:</P>
            <P>(1) An employee's election of coverage or of a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program which requires periodic deductions from pay and which cannot be placed into effect immediately because of normal processing delays; and</P>
            <P>(2) Ministerial adjustments in pay rates or allowances which cannot be placed into effect immediately because of normal processing delays.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limited procedures.</E> If the period of the normal processing delay for which the retroactive deduction must be recovered does not exceed four pay periods, the procedures provided in §§ 361.4 and 361.5 of this part shall not apply, but the Board shall in advance of the collection issue a general notice that:</P>
            <P>(1) Because of the employee's election, future salary will be reduced to cover the period between the effective date of the election and the first regular withholding, and the employee may dispute the amount of the retroactive collection by notifying a specified office or official; or</P>
            <P>(2) Due to a normal ministerial adjustment in pay or allowances which could not be placed into effect immediately, future salary will be reduced to cover any excess pay or allowances received by the employee, the employee may dispute the amount of the retroactive collection by notifying a specified office or official.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitation on exceptions.</E> The exceptions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not include a recovery required to be made for any reason other than normal processing delays in putting the change into effect, even if the period of time for which the amounts must be retroactively withheld is less than four pay periods. Further, if normal processing delays exceed four pay periods, then the full procedures prescribed under §§ 361.4 and 361.5 of this part shall be extended to the employee.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 361.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Exception to requirement that a hearing be offered.</SUBJECT>
            <P>When an employee is overpaid due to the hours worked reported on the payroll exceeding the actual hours worked, no pre-offset hearing must be granted since in such cases there is no question regarding credibility and veracity. In these cases the Board will make its determination under this part based upon review of the written record.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Written agreement to repay debt as alternative to salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification by employee.</E> The employee may propose, in response to a Notice of Intent, a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to do this must submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt which is received by the Board within thirty calendar days of the date of the Notice of Intent.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Board's response.</E> In response to timely notice by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the Board's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, the Board will balance the agency's interest in collecting the debt against hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has not disputed its existence or amount, the Board will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in <PRTPAGE P="618"/>undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset: When deductions may begin.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(b) If the employee filed a petition for hearing with the Board before the expiration of the period provided for in § 361.5, then deductions will begin after the hearing officer has provided the employee with a hearing and the hearing officer's final written decision is in favor of the Board.</P>

            <P>(c) If an employee retires, resigns or his or her period of employment ends before collection of a debt is completed, offset shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> final salary payment, lump sum leave, etc.) due the employee from the Board to the extent necessary to liquidate the debt. If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final payment due the employee from the Board, the Board shall liquidate the debt by administrative offset, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, from later payments of any kind which are due the employee from the United States.</P>

            <P>A debt will be collected in a lump sum or in installments.

However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or $50 a month will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sources of deductions.</E> The Board will make deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.</P>

            <P>(a) This part prescribes regulations under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of 1964, as amended, for the settlement of a claim against the United States made by an officer or employee of the Railroad Retirement Board for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to his service. In accordance with that Act, the possession of such property must be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(b) The Railroad Retirement Board is not an insurer of its officers' or employees' personal property and does not underwrite the damage or loss of such property that may be sustained by an officer or employee. Officers and employees of the Board are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from the Board. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of otherwise unreimbursed or uninsured compensation for his loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of his claim under this part.</P>

In determining what is reasonable, useful or proper the Deputy General Counsel will consider the type and quantity of property involved, the circumstances attending acquisition and use of the property, and whether possession or use by the employee at the time of loss, theft or damage was incident to the employee's service. What is reasonable, useful or proper is a question of fact to be determined by the Deputy General Counsel.</P>

            <P>(a) The amount awarded with regard to any item of personal property will not exceed its depreciated replacement cost at the time of loss. Unless proven to be otherwise, replacement cost will <PRTPAGE P="622"/>be based on the price paid in cash for the property or, if not acquired by purchase or exchange, the value at the time of acquisition. The amount normally payable on property damaged beyond economical repair is found by determining its depreciated value immediately before it was damaged or lost, less any salvage value. If the cost of repair is less than the depreciated value of the property, then it is economically repairable, and the cost of repair is the amount payable.</P>
            <P>(b) Depreciation in value of an item of personal property is determined by considering the type of article involved, its cost, condition when lost or damaged beyond economical repair, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of accrual of the claim.</P>
            <P>(c) Allowance for articles acquired by barter will not exceed the cost of the articles tendered in barter.</P>

            <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 365.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 365.150</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity when viewed in its entirety is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. Although all facilities in which the agency operates, except for the headquarters building, are either owned or leased by and under the general control of the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency recognizes its obligation to request the GSA to make space reassignments or any structural changes which the agency determines are necessary to ensure program accessibility. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or</P>
            <P>(2) Require the agency to take or to recommend to the GSA any action that the agency can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or result in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 365.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chief Executive Officer after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens that would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> In general the agency will comply with this section by making home visits. The agency may also comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs <PRTPAGE P="629"/>or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make or request the GSA to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making or requesting space reassignments or alterations to existing buildings, shall ensure that accessibility requirements, to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it are met. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by February 27, 1989, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, the agency will make such changes or, where applicable, request the GSA to make such changes by December 27, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop or, where applicable, request the GSA to develop, by June 27, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>

            <P>(c) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 365.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chief Executive Officer after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>(b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</P>

            <P>(d) The Chief Executive Officer shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which he or she has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 90 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The Chief Executive Officer may extend this time period for good cause.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Chief Executive Officer receives a complaint over which the agency does not have jurisdiction, he or she shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
            <P>(f) The Chief Executive Officer shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility used by the agency that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(g) Within 120 days of the receipt of a complete complaint under § 365.170(d) for which the agency has jurisdiction, the Chief Executive Officer shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—</P>

            <P>The regulations in this part establish procedures to implement the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134), 31 U.S.C. 3716. The statute authorizes the Board to collect a claim arising under an agency program by means of administrative offset, and requires the Board to refer nontax debts over 180 days delinquent to the Department of Treasury for administrative offset (the “Treasury Offset Program”). No claim may be collected by such means if outstanding for more than 10 years after the Board's right to collection of the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the government <PRTPAGE P="633"/>who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This part specifies the agency procedures that will be followed by the Board for referral and collection by administrative offset.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Past-due legally enforceable debt.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A past-due legally enforceable debt which may be referred to another governmental agency for administrative offset is a debt:</P>
            <P>(a) Which arose under any statute administered by the Board or under any contract; and with respect to debts referred to the Department of Treasury, is a nontax debt;</P>
            <P>(b) Which is an obligation of a debtor who is a natural person or a business;</P>
            <P>(c) Which, except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent at least three months but not more than ten years at the time the offset is made;</P>
            <P>(d) Which is at least $25.00;</P>
            <P>(e) With respect to which the rights described in part 260 or 320 of this chapter or the applicable law regarding reconsideration, waiver, and appeal, if applicable, have been exhausted;</P>
            <P>(f) With respect to which:</P>
            <P>(1) The Board's records do not contain evidence that the debtor (or, if an individual, his or her spouse) has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Board can clearly establish at the time of the referral that the automatic stay under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code has been lifted or is no longer in effect with respect to the debtor (or, if an individual, his or her spouse) and the debt was not discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding; or</P>
            <P>(3) The Board's records do not contain evidence that foreclosure is pending on collateral securing the debt.</P>
            <P>(g) Which cannot currently be collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);</P>
            <P>(h) Which cannot currently be collected by administrative offset under § 255.6 or § 340.6 of this chapter against amounts payable to the debtor under any statute administered by the Board;</P>
            <P>(i) With respect to which the Board has notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to notify, the debtor that the debt is past due, and that unless the debtor repays the debt within 60 days, the debt will be referred to any other agency of the United States government for offset against any money owed the debtor by that agency; and</P>
            <P>(j) With respect to which the Board has given the debtor at least 60 days from the date of the notification required in paragraph (i) of this section to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered evidence, if any, presented by the debtor, and has determined that the amount of such debt is past due and legally enforceable; and</P>
            <P>(k) Which has not been referred to the Department of Justice or which is not otherwise in litigation with the Board.</P>

            <P>(a) The Board may delegate to an employee or employees the responsibility for collecting any claims owed the Board by means of administrative offset, except that all nontax debts over 120 days delinquent shall be referred to the Department of Treasury for administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program as required by 31 U.S.C. 3716;</P>
            <P>(b) Except for mandatory referral of claims to the Department of Treasury or as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Treasury, before collecting a claim by means of administrative offset, the Board must ensure that administrative offset is feasible, allowable, and appropriate, and must notify the debtor of the Board's policies for collecting a claim by means of administrative offset.</P>

            <P>(c) Except for mandatory referral of claims to the Department of Treasury or as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Treasury, whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determination to be made on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of its sound discretion. The Board shall consider not only whether administrative offset <PRTPAGE P="634"/>can be accomplished, both practically and legally, but also whether offset is best suited to further and protect all of the Government's interests. In appropriate circumstances, the Board may give due consideration to the debtor's financial condition, and is not required to use offset in every instance in which there is an available source of funds. The Board may also consider whether offset would substantially interfere with or defeat the purposes of the program authorizing the payments against which offset is contemplated.</P>
            <P>(d) Before advising the debtor that the delinquent debt will be subject to administrative offset, the agency official responsible for administering the program under which the debt arose shall review the claim and determine that the debt is valid and overdue.</P>
            <P>(e) Administrative offset shall be considered by the Board only after attempting to collect a claim under the statutes administered by the Board except that no claim under this Act that has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued may be collected by means of administrative offset, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official of the agency who was charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts.</P>

            <P>(a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information contained in the notification;</P>
            <P>(b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt referred to the other agency for offset; or</P>
            <P>(c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged; the Board will promptly notify the other agency. If the amount of a debt is reduced after referral by the Board and offset by the other agency, the Board will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will promptly notify the other agency of any refund made by the Board. If the amount of debt has increased after referral by the Board but prior to offset by the other agency, then the Board will promptly notify the other agency of such increase.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Board may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect debts owed to the Board by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.</P>

            <P>(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) <PRTPAGE P="635"/>of this section, the Board shall include a written certification that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) The Board has complied with all applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and</P>
            <P>(3) The Board has complied with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act including any required hearing or review.</P>
            <P>(c) When the Board decides to request administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it should make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable due process procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify and flag the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor becomes eligible and requests to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the debtor will be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would render the offset unjust.</P>
            <P>(d) In accordance with procedures established by the Office of Personnel Management, the Board may request an offset from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund prior to completion of due process procedures.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Board collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>The Railroad Retirement Board shall not grant permission for use of the seal in those instances where use of the seal will give the unintended appearance of Agency endorsement or authentication. Situations where use of the seal of the Railroad Retirement Board would be inappropriate include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</P>
            <P>(a) A consulting firm makes arrangements with a railroad to conduct a retirement planning seminar for its employees. Included in the material distributed to the seminar attendees is a booklet, prepared by the consulting firm, which displays the seal of the Railroad Retirement Board on the cover and contains information regarding benefits payable under the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>
            <P>(b) A former employee of the Railroad Retirement Board owns a coffee and donut shop, frequented by present and past railroad workers. Many of the shop's customers know of the owner's prior employment with the Board and frequently ask him questions related to benefits payable under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and Railroad Retirement Acts. The shop owner prepares and distributes to his customers a monthly flyer listing benefit questions presented to him during the month, as well as his answers to the questions. The flyer displays the seal of the Board.</P>
            <P>(c) A retired railroad employee works part-time in a train hobby shop. The shop owner, at the former railroad worker's suggestion, develops and sells items such as coffee mugs and computer mouse pads with text relevant to benefits paid by the Railroad Retirement Board. The text is taken from publications issued by the Railroad Retirement Board. The merchandise also bears the seal of the Railroad Retirement Board.</P>
