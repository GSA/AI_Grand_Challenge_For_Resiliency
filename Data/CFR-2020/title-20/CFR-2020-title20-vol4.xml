      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope of subpart.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This subpart sets forth the regulations governing the Complaint System for the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service (ES) at the State and Federal levels. Specifically, the Complaint System handles complaints against an employer about the specific job to which the applicant was referred through the ES and complaints involving the failure to comply with the ES regulations under parts 651, 652, 653, and 654 of this chapter and this part. As noted in § 658.411(d)(6), this subpart only covers ES-related complaints made within 2 years of the alleged violation.<PRTPAGE P="6"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) Any complaints alleging violations under the Unemployment Insurance program, under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) title I programs, or complaints by veterans alleging employer violations of the mandatory listing requirements under 38 U.S.C. 4212 are not covered by this subpart and must be referred to the appropriate administering agency which would follow the procedures set forth in the respective regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) The Complaint System also accepts, refers, and, under certain circumstances, tracks complaints involving employment-related laws as defined in § 651.10 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) A complainant may designate an individual to act as his/her representative.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishment of local and State complaint systems.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each State Workforce Agency (SWA) must establish and maintain a Complaint System pursuant to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The State Administrator must have overall responsibility for the operation of the Complaint System; this includes responsibility for the informal resolution of complaints. In the ES office, the ES Office Manager is responsible for the operation of the Complaint System.</P>
              <P>(c) SWAs must ensure centralized control procedures are established for the processing of complaints. The ES Office Manager and the SWA Administrator must ensure a central complaint log is maintained, listing all complaints taken by the ES office or the SWA, and specifying for each complaint:</P>
              <P>(1) The name of the complainant;</P>
              <P>(2) The name of the respondent (employer or State agency);</P>
              <P>(3) The date the complaint is filed;</P>
              <P>(4) Whether the complaint is by or on behalf of a migrant and seasonal farmworker (MSFW);</P>
              <P>(5) Whether the complaint concerns an employment-related law or the ES regulations; and</P>
              <P>(6) The action taken, and whether the complaint has been resolved, including informally. The complaint log also must include action taken on apparent violations.</P>
              <P>(d) State agencies must ensure information pertaining to the use of the Complaint System is publicized, which must include, but is not limited to, the prominent display of an Employment and Training Administration (ETA)-approved Complaint System poster in each one-stop center.</P>
              <P>(e) Each one-stop center must ensure there is appropriate staff available during regular office hours to take complaints.</P>
              <P>(f) Complaints may be accepted in any one-stop center, or by a SWA, or elsewhere by outreach staff.</P>
              <P>(g) All complaints filed through the local ES office must be handled by a trained Complaint System Representative.</P>
              <P>(h) All complaints received by a SWA must be assigned to a trained Complaint System Representative designated by the State Administrator, provided that the Complaint System Representative designated to handle MSFW complaints must be the State Monitor Advocate (SMA).</P>
              <P>(i) State agencies must ensure any action taken by the Complaint System Representative, including referral on a complaint from an MSFW, is fully documented and contains all relevant information, including a notation of the type of each complaint pursuant to Department guidance, a copy of the original complaint form, a copy of any ES-related reports, any relevant correspondence, a list of actions taken, a record of pertinent telephone calls, and all correspondence relating thereto.</P>
              <P>(j) Within 1 month after the end of the calendar quarter, the ES office manager must transmit an electronic copy of the quarterly Complaint System log described in paragraph (c) of this section to the SMA. These logs must be made available to the Department upon request.</P>
              <P>(k) The appropriate ES staff handling a complaint must offer to assist the complainant through the provision of appropriate services.</P>

              <P>(l) The State Administrator must establish a referral system for cases where a complaint is filed alleging a violation that occurred in the same State but through a different ES office.<PRTPAGE P="7"/>
              </P>
              <P>(m) Follow-up on unresolved complaints. When an MSFW submits a complaint, the SMA must follow-up monthly on the handling of the complaint, and must inform the complainant of the status of the complaint. No follow-up with the complainant is required for non-MSFW complaints.</P>
              <P>(n) When a complainant is an English Language Learner (ELL), all written correspondence with the complainant under part 658, subpart E must include a translation into the complainant's native language.</P>
              <P>(o) A complainant may designate an individual to act as his/her representative throughout the filing and processing of a complaint.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) Whenever an individual indicates an interest in filing a complaint under this subpart with an ES office, the SWA, or outreach staff, the individual receiving the complaint must offer to explain the operation of the Complaint System and must offer to take the complaint in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) During the initial discussion with the complainant, the staff taking the complaint must:</P>
              <P>(i) Make every effort to obtain all the information he/she perceives to be necessary to investigate the complaint;</P>
              <P>(ii) Request that the complainant indicate all of the physical addresses, email, and telephone numbers through which he/she might be contacted during the investigation of the complaint; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Request that the complainant contact the Complaint System Representative before leaving the area if possible, and explain the need to maintain contact during the investigation.</P>
              <P>(3) The staff must ensure the complainant (or his/her representative) submits the complaint on the Complaint/Referral Form or another complaint form prescribed or approved by the Department or submits complaint information which satisfies paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The Complaint/Referral Form must be used for all complaints, including complaints about unlawful discrimination, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The staff must offer to assist the complainant in filling out the form and submitting all necessary information, and must do so if the complainant desires such assistance. If the complainant also represents several other complainants, all such complainants must be named. The complainant, or his/her representative, must sign the completed form in writing or electronically. The identity of the complainant(s) and any persons who furnish information relating to, or assisting in, an investigation of a complaint must be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible, consistent with applicable law and a fair determination of the complaint. A copy of the completed complaint submission must be given to the complainant(s), and the complaint form must be given to the appropriate Complaint System Representative described in § 658.410(g).</P>
              <P>(4) Any complaint in a reasonable form (letter or email) which is signed by the complainant, or his/her representative, and includes sufficient information to initiate an investigation must be treated as if it were a properly completed Complaint/Referral Form filed in person. A letter (via hard copy or email) confirming the complaint was received must be sent to the complainant and the document must be sent to the appropriate Complaint System Representative. The Complaint System Representative must request additional information from the complainant if the complainant has not provided sufficient information to investigate the matter expeditiously.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Complaints regarding an employment-related law.</E> (1) When a complaint is filed regarding an employment-related law with a ES office or a SWA the office must determine if the complainant is an MSFW.</P>

              <P>(i) If the complainant is a non-MSFW, the office must immediately refer the complainant to the appropriate enforcement agency, another public agency, a legal aid organization, and/or a consumer advocate organization, as appropriate, for assistance. Upon completing the referral the local or State representative is not required to follow-up with the complainant.<PRTPAGE P="8"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If the complainant is a MSFW, the ES office or SWA Complaint System Representative must:</P>
              <P>(A) Take from the MSFW or his/her representative, in writing (hard copy or electronic), the complaint(s) describing the alleged violation(s) of the employment-related law(s); and</P>
              <P>(B) Attempt to resolve the issue informally at the local level, except in cases where the complaint was submitted to the SWA and the SMA determines that he/she must take immediate action and except in cases where informal resolution at the local level would be detrimental to the complainant(s). In cases where informal resolution at the local level would be detrimental to the complainant(s), the Complaint System Representative or SMA (depending on where the complaint was filed) must immediately refer the complaint to the appropriate enforcement agency. Concurrently, the Complaint System Representative must offer to refer the MSFW to other employment services should the MSFW be interested.</P>
              <P>(C) If the issue is not resolved within 5 business days, the Complaint System Representative must refer the complaint to the appropriate enforcement agency (or another public agency, a legal aid organization, or a consumer advocate organization, as appropriate) for further assistance.</P>
              <P>(D) If the ES office or SWA Complaint System Representative determines that the complaint must be referred to a State or Federal agency, he/she must refer the complaint to the SMA who must immediately refer the complaint to the appropriate enforcement agency for prompt action.</P>
              <P>(E) If the complaint was referred to the SMA under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, the representative must provide the SMA's contact information to the complainant. The SMA must notify the complainant of the enforcement agency to which the complaint was referred.</P>
              <P>(2) If an enforcement agency makes a final determination that the employer violated an employment-related law and the complaint is connected to a job order, the SWA must initiate procedures for discontinuation of services immediately in accordance with subpart F of this part. If this occurs, the SWA must notify the complainant and the employer of this action.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Complaints alleging a violation of rights under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations or enforced by the Department of Labor's Civil Rights Center (CRC).</E> (1) All complaints received by a ES office or a SWA alleging unlawful discrimination, as well as reprisal for protected activity, in violation of EEOC regulations, must be logged and immediately referred to either a local Equal Opportunity (EO) representative, the State EO representative, or the EEOC. The Complaint System Representative must notify the complainant of the referral in writing.</P>
              <P>(2) Any complaints received either at the local and State level or at the ETA regional office, that allege violations of civil rights laws and regulations such as those under title VI of the Civil Rights Act or sec. 188 of WIOA, including for beneficiaries (as defined in 29 CFR 38.4) only, on the basis of citizenship status or participant status, as well as reprisal for protected activity, must immediately be logged and directed or forwarded to the recipient's Equal Opportunity Officer or the CRC.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Complaints regarding the ES regulations (ES complaints).</E> (1) When an ES complaint is filed with a ES office or a SWA the following procedures apply:</P>
              <P>(i) When an ES complaint is filed against an employer, the proper office to handle the complaint is the ES office serving the area in which the employer is located.</P>
              <P>(ii) When a complaint is against an employer in another State or against another SWA:</P>

              <P>(A) The ES office or SWA receiving the complaint must send, after ensuring that the Complaint/Referral Form is adequately completed, a copy of the Complaint/Referral Form and copies of any relevant documents to the SWA in the other State. Copies of the referral letter must be sent to the complainant, and copies of the complaint and referral letter must be sent to the ETA Regional Office(s) with jurisdiction over the transferring and receiving State agencies. All such copies must be sent via hard copy or electronic mail.<PRTPAGE P="9"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The SWA receiving the complaint must handle the complaint as if it had been initially filed with that SWA.</P>
              <P>(C) The ETA regional office with jurisdiction over the receiving SWA must follow-up with it to ensure the complaint is handled in accordance with these regulations.</P>
              <P>(D) If the complaint is against more than one SWA, the complaint must so clearly state. Additionally, the complaints must be processed as separate complaints and must be handled according to procedures in this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(iii) When an ES complaint is filed against a ES office, the proper office to handle the complaint is the ES office serving the area in which the alleged violation occurred.</P>
              <P>(iv) When an ES complaint is filed against more than one ES offices and is in regard to an alleged agency-wide violation the SWA representative or his/her designee must process the complaint.</P>
              <P>(v) When a complaint is filed alleging a violation that occurred in the same State but through a different ES office, the ES office where the complaint is filed must ensure that the Complaint/Referral Form is adequately completed and send the form to the appropriate local ES office for tracking, further referral if necessary, and follow-up. A copy of the referral letter must be sent to the complainant via hard copy or electronic mail.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If a complaint regarding an alleged violation of the ES regulations is filed in a ES office by either a non-MSFW or MSFW, or their representative(s) (or if all necessary information has been submitted to the office pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section), the appropriate ES office Complaint System Representative must investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint immediately upon receipt.</P>
              <P>(ii) If resolution has not been achieved to the satisfaction of the complainant within 15 working days after receipt of the complaint, or 5 working days with respect to complaints filed by or on behalf of MSFWs, (or after all necessary information has been submitted to the ES office pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section), the Complaint System Representative must send the complaint to the SWA for resolution or further action.</P>
              <P>(iii) The ES office must notify the complainant and the respondent, in writing (via hard copy or electronic mail), of the determination (pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section) of its investigation under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, or of the referral to the SWA (if referred).</P>

              <P>(a) The hearing described in § 658.411(d)(5) must be held by State hearing officials. A State hearing official may be any State official authorized to hold hearings under State law. <PRTPAGE P="11"/>Examples of hearing officials are referees in State unemployment compensation hearings and officials of the State agency authorized to preside at State administrative hearings.</P>
              <P>(b) The State hearing official may decide to conduct hearings on more than one complaint concurrently if he/she determines that the issues are related or that the complaints will be handled more expeditiously if conducted together.</P>
              <P>(c) The State hearing official, upon the referral of a case for a hearing, must:</P>
              <P>(1) Notify all involved parties of the date, time, and place of the hearing; and</P>
              <P>(2) Reschedule the hearing, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) In conducting a hearing, the State hearing official must:</P>
              <P>(1) Regulate the course of the hearing;</P>
              <P>(2) Issue subpoenas if necessary, provided the official has the authority to do so under State law;</P>
              <P>(3) Ensure that all relevant issues are considered;</P>
              <P>(4) Rule on the introduction of evidence and testimony; and</P>
              <P>(5) Take all actions necessary to ensure an orderly proceeding.</P>

              <P>(i) Federal and State rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this section; however rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination, must be applied where reasonably necessary by the State hearing official. The State hearing official may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.</P>
              <P>(j) The case record, or any portion thereof, must be available for inspection and copying by any party at, prior to, or subsequent to the hearing upon request. Special procedures may be used for disclosure of medical and psychological records such as disclosure to a physician designated by the individual.</P>
              <P>(k) The State hearing official must, if feasible, resolve the dispute at any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(l) At the State hearing official's discretion, other appropriate individuals, organizations, or associations may be permitted to participate in the hearing as amicus curiae (friends of the court) with respect to any legal or factual issues relevant to the complaint. Any documents submitted by the amicus curiae must be included in the record.</P>
              <P>(m) If the parties to the hearing are located in more than one State or are located in the same State but access to the hearing location is extremely inconvenient for one or more parties as determined by the State hearing official, the hearing official must:</P>
              <P>(1) Whenever possible, hold a single hearing at a location convenient to all parties or their representatives wishing to appear and present evidence, with all such parties and/or their representatives present.</P>
              <P>(2) If a hearing location cannot be established by the State hearing official under paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the State hearing official may conduct, with the consent of the parties, the hearing by a telephone conference call from a State agency office. If the hearing is conducted via telephone conference call the parties and their representatives must have the option to participate in person or via telephone.</P>

              <P>(3) Where the State agency is not able, for any reason, to conduct a telephonic hearing under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the State agencies in the States where the parties are located must take evidence and hold the hearing in the same manner as used for appealed interstate unemployment claims in those States, to the extent <PRTPAGE P="12"/>that such procedures are consistent with this section.</P>

An appeal includes any letter or other writing which the Regional Administrator reasonably understands to be requesting review if it is received by the regional office and signed by a party to the complaint.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Once the Regional Administrator receives a timely appeal, he/she must request the complete SWA file, including the original Complaint/Referral Form from the appropriate SWA.</P>
              <P>(2) The Regional Administrator must review the file in the case and must determine within 10 business days whether any further investigation or action is appropriate; however if the Regional Administrator determines that he/she needs to request legal advice from the Office of the Solicitor at the U.S. Department of Labor then the Regional Administrator is allowed 20 business days to make this determination.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Regional Administrator determines that no further action is warranted, the Regional Administrator will send his/her determination in writing to the appellant within 5 days of the determination, with a notification that the appellant may request a hearing before a Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) by filing a hearing request in writing with the Regional Administrator within 20 working days of the appellant's receipt of the notification.</P>

            <SUBJECT>State Workforce Agency responsibility.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Each SWA must establish and maintain a self-appraisal system for ES operations to determine success in reaching goals and to correct deficiencies in performance. The self-appraisal system must include numerical (quantitative) appraisal and non-numerical (qualitative) appraisal.<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Numerical appraisal at the ES office level must be conducted as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Performance must be measured on a quarterly-basis against planned service levels as stated in the Unified or Combined State Plan (“State Plan”). The State Plan must be consistent with numerical goals contained in ES office plans.</P>
            <P>(ii) To appraise numerical activities/indicators, actual results as shown on the Department's ETA Form 9172, or any successor report required by the Department must be compared to planned levels. Differences between achievement and plan levels must be identified.</P>
            <P>(iii) When the numerical appraisal of required activities/indicators identifies significant differences from planned levels, additional analysis must be conducted to isolate possible contributing factors. This data analysis must include, as appropriate, comparisons to past performance, attainment of State Plan goals and consideration of pertinent non-numerical factors.</P>
            <P>(iv) Results of ES office numerical reviews must be documented and significant deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must be developed to address these deficiencies.</P>
            <P>(v) The result of ES office appraisal, including corrective action plans, must be communicated in writing to the next higher level of authority for review. This review must cover adequacy of analysis, appropriateness of corrective actions, and need for higher level involvement. When this review is conducted at an area or district office, a report describing ES office performance within the area or district jurisdiction must be communicated to the SWA on a quarterly basis.</P>
            <P>(2) Numerical appraisal at the SWA level must be conducted as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Performance must be measured on a quarterly basis against planned service levels as stated in the State Plan. The State Plan must be consistent with numerical goals contained in ES office plans.</P>
            <P>(ii) To appraise these key numerical activities/indicators, actual results as shown on ETA Form 9172, or any successor report required by the Department must be compared to planned levels. Differences between achievement and plan levels must be identified.</P>
            <P>(iii) The SWA must review statewide data and performance against planned service levels as stated in the State Plan on at least a quarterly basis to identify significant statewide deficiencies and to determine the need for additional analysis, including identification of trends, comparisons to past performance, and attainment of State Plan goals.</P>
            <P>(iv) Results of numerical reviews must be documented and significant deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section must be developed to address these deficiencies. These plans must be submitted to the ETA Regional Office as part of the periodic performance process described at § 658.603(d)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) Non-numerical (qualitative) appraisal of ES office activities must be conducted at least annually as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Each ES office must assess the quality of its services to applicants, employers, and the community and its compliance with Federal regulations.</P>
            <P>(ii) At a minimum, non-numerical review must include an assessment of the following factors:</P>
            <P>(A) Appropriateness of services provided to participants and employers;</P>
            <P>(B) Timely delivery of services to participants and employers;</P>
            <P>(C) Staff responsiveness to individual participants and employer needs;</P>
            <P>(D) Thoroughness and accuracy of documents prepared in the course of service delivery; and</P>
            <P>(E) Effectiveness of ES interface with external organizations, such as other ETA-funded programs, community groups, etc.</P>
            <P>(iii) Non-numerical review methods must include:</P>
            <P>(A) Observation of processes;</P>
            <P>(B) Review of documents used in service provisions; and</P>
            <P>(C) Solicitation of input from applicants, employers, and the community.</P>

            <P>(iv) The result of non-numerical reviews must be documented and deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan addressing these deficiencies as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must be developed.<PRTPAGE P="20"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) The result of ES office non-numerical appraisal, including corrective actions, must be communicated in writing to the next higher level of authority for review. This review must cover thoroughness and adequacy of ES office appraisal, appropriateness of corrective actions, and need for higher level involvement. When this review is conducted at an area or district level, a report summarizing local ES office performance within that jurisdiction must be communicated to the SWA on an annual basis.</P>
            <P>(4) As part of its oversight responsibilities, the SWA must conduct onsite reviews in those ES offices which show continuing internal problems or deficiencies in performance as indicated by such sources as data analysis, non-numerical appraisal, or other sources of information.</P>
            <P>(5) Non-numerical (qualitative) review of SWA ES activities must be conducted as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) SWA operations must be assessed annually to determine compliance with Federal regulations.</P>
            <P>(ii) Results of non-numerical reviews must be documented and deficiencies identified. A corrective action plan addressing these deficiencies must be developed.</P>
            <P>(6) Corrective action plans developed to address deficiencies uncovered at any administrative level within the State as a result of the self-appraisal process must include:</P>
            <P>(i) Specific descriptions of the type of action to be taken, the time frame involved, and the assignment of responsibility.</P>
            <P>(ii) Provision for the delivery of technical assistance as needed.</P>
            <P>(iii) A plan to conduct follow-up on a timely basis to determine if action taken to correct the deficiencies has been effective.</P>

            <P>(7)(i) The provisions of the ES regulations which require numerical and non-numerical assessment of service to special applicant groups (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, services to veterans at 20 CFR part 1001—Services for Veterans and services to MSFWs at this part and part 653 of this chapter), are supplementary to the provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Each State Administrator and ES office manager must ensure their staff know and carry out ES regulations, including regulations on performance standards and program emphases, and any corrective action plans imposed by the SWA or by the Department.</P>
            <P>(iii) Each State Administrator must ensure the SWA complies with its approved State Plan.</P>
            <P>(iv) Each State Administrator must ensure to the maximum extent feasible the accuracy of data entered by the SWA into Department-required management information systems.

            <SUBJECT>Assessment and evaluation of program performance data.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) State Workforce Agencies must compile program performance data required by the Department, including statistical information on program operations.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department must use the program performance data in assessing and evaluating whether each SWA has complied with ES regulations and its State Plan.</P>
            <P>(c) In assessing and evaluating program performance data, the Department must act in accordance with the following general principles:</P>
            <P>(1) The fact that the program performance data from a SWA, whether overall or relative to a particular program activity, indicate poor program performance does not by itself constitute a violation of ES regulations or of the State Workforce Agency's responsibilities under its State Plan;</P>

            <P>(2) Program performance data, however, may so strongly indicate that a SWA's performance is so poor that the data may raise a presumption (<E T="03">prima facie</E> case) that a SWA is violating ES regulations or the State Plan. A SWA's failure to meet the operational objectives set forth in the State Plan raises a presumption that the agency is violating ES regulations and/or obligations under its State Plan. In such cases, the Department must afford the SWA an opportunity to rebut the presumption of a violation pursuant to the procedures at subpart H of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department must take into account that certain program performance data may measure items over which SWAs have direct or substantial control while other data may measure items over which the SWA has indirect or minimal control.</P>
            <P>(i) Generally, for example, a SWA has direct and substantial control over the delivery of employment services such as referrals to jobs, job development contacts, counseling, referrals to career and supportive services, and the conduct of field checks.</P>
            <P>(ii) State Workforce Agencies, however, have only indirect control over the outcome of services. For example, SWAs cannot guarantee that an employer will hire a referred applicant, nor can they guarantee that the terms and conditions of employment will be as stated on a job order.</P>
            <P>(iii) Outside forces, such as a sudden heavy increase in unemployment rates, a strike by SWA employees, or a severe drought or flood, may skew the results measured by program performance data.</P>
            <P>(4) The Department must consider a SWA's failure to keep accurate and complete program performance data required by ES regulations as a violation of the ES regulations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Initial action by the Regional Administrator.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The ETA Regional Administrator is responsible for ensuring that all SWAs in his/her region are in compliance with ES regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) Wherever a Regional Administrator discovers or is apprised of possible SWA violations of ES regulations by the review and assessment activities under subpart G of this part, or through required reports or written complaints from individuals, organizations, or employers which are elevated to the Department after the exhaustion of SWA administrative remedies, the Regional Administrator must conduct an investigation. Within 10 business days after receipt of the report or other information, the Regional Administrator must make a determination whether there is probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) The Regional Administrator must accept complaints regarding possible SWA violations of ES regulations from employee organizations, employers or other groups, without exhaustion of the complaint process described at subpart E of this part, if the Regional Administrator determines that the nature and scope of the complaint are such that the time required to exhaust the administrative procedures at the State level would adversely affect a significant number of applicants. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must investigate the matter within 10 business days, may provide the SWA 10 business days for comment, and must make a determination within an additional 10 business days whether there is probable cause to believe that the SWA has violated ES regulations.</P>

            <P>(d) If the Regional Administrator determines that there is no probable cause to believe that a SWA has violated ES regulations, he/she must retain all reports and supporting information in Department files. In all cases where the Regional Administrator has insufficient information to make a probable cause determination, <PRTPAGE P="28"/>he/she must so notify the Administrator in writing and the time for the investigation must be extended 20 additional business days.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Regional Administrator determines there is probable cause to believe a SWA has violated ES regulations, he/she must issue a Notice of Initial Findings of Non-compliance by registered mail (or other legally viable means) to the offending SWA. The notice will specify the nature of the violation, cite the regulations involved, and indicate corrective action which may be imposed in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. If the non-compliance involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must be sent to the NMA.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) The SWA may have 20 business days to comment on the findings, or up to 20 additional days, if the Regional Administrator determines a longer period is appropriate. The SWA's comments must include agreement or disagreement with the findings and suggested corrective actions, where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) After the period elapses, the Regional Administrator must prepare within 20 business days, written final findings which specify whether the SWA has violated ES regulations. If in the final findings the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has not violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must notify the State Administrator of this finding and retain supporting documents in his/her files. If the final finding involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator also must notify the NMA. If the Regional Administrator determines a SWA has violated ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must prepare a Final Notice of Noncompliance which must specify the violation(s) and cite the regulations involved. The Final Notice of Noncompliance must be sent to the SWA by registered mail or other legally viable means. If the noncompliance involves services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of the Final Notice must be sent to the NMA.</P>
            <P>(g) If the violation involves the misspending of grant funds, the Regional Administrator may order in the Final Notice of Noncompliance a disallowance of the expenditure and may either demand repayment or withhold future funds in the amount in question. If the Regional Administrator disallows costs, the Regional Administrator must give the reasons for the disallowance, inform the SWA that the disallowance is effective immediately and that no more funds may be spent in the disallowed manner, and offer the SWA the opportunity to request a hearing pursuant to § 658.707. The offer, or the acceptance of an offer of a hearing, however, does not stay the effectiveness of the disallowance. The Regional Administrator must keep complete records of the disallowance.</P>
            <P>(h) If the violation does not involve misspending of grant funds or the Regional Administrator determines that the circumstances warrant other action:</P>
            <P>(1) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must direct the SWA to implement a specific corrective action plan to correct all violations. If the SWA's comment demonstrates with supporting evidence (except where inappropriate) that all violations have already been corrected, the Regional Administrator need not impose a corrective action plan and instead may cite the violation(s) and accept the SWA's resolution, subject to follow-up review, if necessary. If the Regional Administrator determines that the violation(s) cited had been found previously and that the corrective action(s) taken had not corrected the violation(s) contrary to the findings of previous follow-up reviews, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to § 658.704.</P>

            <P>(2) The Final Notice of Noncompliance must specify the time by which each corrective action must be taken. This period may not exceed 40 business days unless the Regional Administrator determines that exceptional circumstances necessitate corrective actions requiring a longer time period. In such cases, and if the violations involve services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the exceptional circumstances which necessitate more time, and must specify the additional <PRTPAGE P="29"/>time period. The specified time must commence with the date of signature on the registered mail receipt.</P>
            <P>(3) When the time provided for in paragraph (h)(2) of this section elapses, Department staff must review the SWA's efforts as documented by the SWA to determine if the corrective action(s) has been taken and if the SWA has achieved compliance with ES regulations. If necessary, Department staff must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review.</P>
            <P>(4) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must record the basis for this determination, notify the SWA, send a copy to the Administrator, and retain a copy in Department files.</P>
            <P>(5) If, as a result of this review, the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has taken corrective action but is unable to determine if the violation has been corrected due to seasonality or other factors, the Regional Administrator must notify in writing the SWA and the Administrator of his/her findings. The Regional Administrator must conduct further follow-up at an appropriate time to make a final determination if the violation has been corrected. If the Regional Administrator's follow-up reveals that violations have not been corrected, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to § 658.704.</P>
            <P>(6) If, as a result of the review the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has not corrected the violations and has not made good faith efforts and adequate progress toward the correction of the violations, the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions to the SWA pursuant to § 658.704.</P>
            <P>(7) If, as a result of the review, the Regional Administrator determines the SWA has made good faith efforts and adequate progress toward the correction of the violation and it appears the violation will be fully corrected within a reasonable amount of time, the SWA must be advised by registered mail or other legally viable means (with a copy sent to the Administrator) of this conclusion, of remaining differences, of further needed corrective action, and that all deficiencies must be corrected within a specified time period. This period may not exceed 40 business days unless the Regional Administrator determines exceptional circumstances necessitate corrective action requiring more time. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the exceptional circumstances which necessitate more time, and must specify that time period. The specified time commences with the date of signature on the registered mail receipt.</P>
            <P>(8)(i) If the SWA has been given additional time pursuant to paragraph (h)(7) of this section, Department staff must review the SWA's efforts as documented by the SWA at the end of the time period. If necessary, the Department must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the SWA has corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must document that finding, notify in writing the SWA and the Administrator, and retain supporting documents in Department files. If the SWA has not corrected the violation(s), the Regional Administrator must apply remedial actions pursuant to § 658.704.</P>

            <P>In critical situations as determined by the Regional Administrator, where it is necessary to protect the integrity of the funds, or ensure the proper operation of the program, the Regional Administrator may impose immediate corrective action. Where immediate corrective action is imposed, the Regional Administrator must notify the SWA of the reason for imposing the emergency corrective action prior to providing the SWA an opportunity to comment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Remedial actions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If a SWA fails to correct violations as determined pursuant to § 658.702, the Regional Administrator must apply one or more of the following remedial actions to the SWA:</P>
            <P>(1) Imposition of special reporting requirements for a specified time;</P>

            <P>(2) Restrictions of obligational authority within one or more expense classifications;<PRTPAGE P="30"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Implementation of specific operating systems or procedures for a specified time;</P>
            <P>(4) Requirement of special training for ES staff;</P>
            <P>(5) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a conference with the Assistant Secretary, the elevation of specific decision-making functions from the State Administrator to the Regional Administrator;</P>
            <P>(6) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a conference with the Assistant Secretary, the imposition of Federal staff in key SWA positions;</P>
            <P>(7) With the approval of the Assistant Secretary and after affording the State Administrator the opportunity to request a conference with the Assistant Secretary, funding of the SWA on a short-term basis or partial withholding of funds for a specific function or for a specific geographical area;</P>
            <P>(8) Holding of public hearings in the State on the SWA's deficiencies;</P>
            <P>(9) Disallowance of funds pursuant to § 658.702(g); or</P>
            <P>(10) If the matter involves a serious or continual violation, the initiation of decertification procedures against the State Workforce Agency, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

            <P>(b) The Regional Administrator must send, by registered mail, a Notice of Remedial Action to the SWA. The Notice of Remedial Action must set forth the reasons for the remedial action. When such a notice is the result of violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs (§§ 653.100 <E T="03">through 653.113</E> of this chapter) or the Complaint System (§§ 658.400 through 658.426), a copy of said notice must be sent to the Administrator, who must publish the notice promptly in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
            <P>(c) If the remedial action is other than decertification, the notice must state the remedial action must take effect immediately. The notice also must state the SWA may request a hearing pursuant to § 658.707 by filing a request in writing with the Regional Administrator pursuant to § 658.707 within 20 business days of the SWA's receipt of the notice. The offer of hearing, or the acceptance thereof, however, does not stay or otherwise delay the implementation of remedial action.</P>

            <P>(d) Within 60 business days after the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator must conduct a review of the SWA's compliance with ES regulations unless the Regional Administrator determines more time is necessary. In such cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate more time, and specify that time period. If necessary, Department staff must conduct a follow-up visit as part of this review. If the SWA is in compliance with the ES regulations, the Regional Administrator must fully document these facts and must terminate the remedial actions. The Regional Administrator must notify the SWA of his/her findings. When the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy of said notice must be sent to the Administrator, who must promptly publish the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Regional Administrator must conduct, within a reasonable time after terminating the remedial actions, a review of the SWA's compliance to determine whether any remedial actions must be reapplied.</P>

            <P>(e) If, upon conducting the on-site review referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Administrator finds the SWA remains in noncompliance, the Regional Administrator must continue the remedial action and/or impose different additional remedial actions. The Regional Administrator must fully document all such decisions and, when the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, must send copies to the Administrator, who must promptly publish the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

            <P>(f)(1) If the SWA has not brought itself into compliance with ES regulations within 120 business days of the initial application of remedial action, the Regional Administrator must initiate decertification unless the Regional Administrator determines the circumstances necessitate continuing remedial action for more time. In such <PRTPAGE P="31"/>cases, the Regional Administrator must notify the Administrator in writing of the circumstances which necessitate the extended time, and specify the time period.</P>

            <P>(2) The Regional Administrator must notify the SWA by registered mail or by other legally viable means of the decertification proceedings, and must state the reasons therefor. Whenever such a notice is sent to a SWA, the Regional Administrator must prepare five copies (hard copies or electronic copies) containing, in chronological order, all the documents pertinent to the case along with a request for decertification stating the grounds therefor. One copy must be retained. Two must be sent to the ETA National Office, one must be sent to the Solicitor of Labor, Attention: Associate Solicitor for Employment and Training, and, if the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, one copy must be sent to the NMA. All copies also must be sent electronically to each respective party. The notice sent by the Regional Administrator must be published promptly in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Decision to decertify.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Within 30 business days of receiving a request for decertification, the ETA Assistant Secretary must review the case and must decide whether to proceed with decertification.</P>
            <P>(b) The Assistant Secretary must grant the request for decertification unless he/she makes a finding that:</P>
            <P>(1) The violations of ES regulations are neither serious nor continual;</P>
            <P>(2) The SWA is in compliance; or</P>
            <P>(3) The Assistant Secretary has reason to believe the SWA will achieve compliance within 80 business days unless exceptional circumstances necessitate more time, pursuant to the remedial action already applied or to be applied. (In the event the Assistant Secretary does not have sufficient information to act upon the request, he/she may postpone the determination for up to an additional 20 business days in order to obtain any available additional information.) In making a determination of whether violations are “serious” or “continual,” as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Assistant Secretary must consider:</P>
            <P>(i) Statewide or multiple deficiencies as shown by performance data and/or on-site reviews;</P>
            <P>(ii) Recurrent violations, even if they do not persist over consecutive reporting periods, and</P>
            <P>(iii) The good faith efforts of the State to achieve full compliance with ES regulations as shown by the record.</P>

            <P>(c) If the Assistant Secretary denies a request for decertification, he/she must write a complete report documenting his/her findings and, if appropriate, instructing an alternate remedial action or actions be applied. Electronic copies of the report must be sent to the Regional Administrator. Notice of the Assistant Secretary's decision must be published promptly in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the report of the Assistant Secretary must be made available for public inspection and copying.</P>
            <P>(d) If the Assistant Secretary decides decertification is appropriate, he/she must submit the case to the Secretary providing written explanation for his/her recommendation of decertification.</P>

            <P>(e) Within 30 business days after receiving the Assistant Secretary's report, the Secretary must determine whether to decertify the SWA. The Secretary must grant the request for decertification unless he/she makes one of the three findings set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the Secretary decides not to decertify, he/she must then instruct that remedial action be continued or that alternate actions be applied. The Secretary must write a report explaining his/her reasons for not decertifying the SWA and copies (hard copy and electronic) will be sent to the SWA. Notice of the Secretary's decision must be published promptly in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and the report of the Secretary must be made available for public inspection and copy.</P>

            <P>(f) Where either the Assistant Secretary or the Secretary denies a request for decertification and orders further remedial action, the Regional Administrator must continue to monitor the SWA's compliance. If the SWA achieves compliance within the time <PRTPAGE P="32"/>established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Regional Administrator must terminate the remedial actions. If the SWA fails to achieve full compliance within that time period after the Secretary's decision not to decertify, the Regional Administrator must submit a report of his/her findings to the Assistant Secretary who must reconsider the request for decertification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

When the case involves violations of regulations governing services to MSFWs or the Complaint System, a copy must be sent to the NMA.</P>

            <P>Under title I of WIA, the workforce investment system provides the framework for delivery of workforce investment activities at the State and local levels to individuals who need those services, including job seekers, dislocated workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce, veterans, persons with disabilities, and employers.

Wherever possible, system features such as design options and categories of services are broadly defined, and are subject to State and local interpretation.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary, in consultation with other Federal Agencies, as appropriate, may publish guidance on interpretations of statutory and regulatory provisions.

            <P>(c) If the alternative entity does not provide for representative membership of each of the categories of required State Board membership under WIA section 111(b), the State Plan must explain the manner in which the State will ensure an ongoing role for any unrepresented membership group in the workforce investment system. The State Board may maintain an ongoing role for an unrepresented membership group, including entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, by means such as regularly scheduled consultations with entities within the unrepresented membership groups, by providing an opportunity for input into the State Plan or other policy development by unrepresented membership groups, or by establishing an advisory committee of unrepresented membership groups.</P>
            <P>(d) If the membership structure of the alternative entity is significantly changed after December 31, 1997, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the State Board. In such case, the Governor must establish a new State Board which meets all of the criteria of WIA section 111(b).</P>

            <P>(e) A significant change in the membership structure includes any significant change in the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. A significant change in the membership structure is considered to have occurred when members are added to represent groups not previously represented on the entity. A significant change in the membership structure is not considered to have occurred when <PRTPAGE P="40"/>additional members are added to an existing membership category, when non-voting members are added, or when a member is added to fill a vacancy created in an existing membership category.</P>
            <P>(f) In 20 CFR parts 660 through 671, all references to the State Board also apply to an alternative entity used by a State.</P>

The State Plan must describe the State's process and timeline for ensuring a meaningful opportunity for public comment.</P>
            <P>(e) The Secretary reviews completed plans and must approve all plans within ninety days of their submission, unless the Secretary determines in writing that:</P>
            <P>(1) The plan is inconsistent with the provisions of title I of WIA or the WIA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37. For example, a finding of inconsistency would be made if the Secretary and the Governor have not reached agreement on the adjusted levels of performance under WIA section 136(b)(3)(A), or there is not an effective strategy in place to ensure development of a fully operational One-Stop delivery system in the State; or</P>
            <P>(2) The portion of the plan describing the detailed Wagner-Peyser plan does not satisfy the criteria for approval of such plans as provided in section 8(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act or the Wagner-Peyser regulations at 20 CFR part 652.</P>
            <P>(3) A plan which is incomplete, or which does not contain sufficient information to determine whether it is consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of title I of WIA or of section 8(d) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, will be considered to be inconsistent with those requirements.</P>

            <P>(1) Changes in Federal or State law or policy substantially change the assumptions upon which the plan is based.</P>

            <P>(2) There are changes in the Statewide vision, strategies, policies, performance indicators, the methodology used to determine local allocation of funds, reorganizations which change the working relationship with system employees, changes in organizational responsibilities, changes to the membership structure of the State Board or <PRTPAGE P="41"/>alternative entity and similar substantial changes to the State's workforce investment system.</P>
            <P>(3) The State has failed to meet performance goals, and must adjust service strategies.</P>
            <P>(c) Modifications are required in accordance with the Wagner-Peyser provisions at 20 CFR 652.212.</P>

            <P>(3) The Local Board may provide an ongoing role for an unrepresented membership group, including entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, by means such as regularly scheduled consultations with entities within the unrepresented membership groups, by providing an opportunity for input into the local plan or other policy development by unrepresented membership groups, or by establishing an advisory committee of unrepresented membership groups. The Local Board must enter into good faith negotiations over the terms of the MOU with all entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, including programs not represented on the alternative entity.</P>
            <P>(c) If the membership structure of an alternative entity is significantly changed after December 31, 1997, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the Local Board. In such case, the chief elected official(s) must establish a new Local Board which meets all of the criteria of WIA section 117(a), (b), and (c) and (h)(1) and (2).</P>

            <P>(d) A significant change in the membership structure includes any significant change in the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. A significant change in the membership structure is considered to have occurred when members are added to represent groups not previously represented on the entity. A significant change in the membership structure is not considered to have occurred when additional members are added to an existing membership category, when non-voting members (including a Youth <PRTPAGE P="46"/>Council) are added, or when a member is added to fill a vacancy created in an existing membership category.</P>
            <P>(e) In 20 CFR parts 660 through 671, all references to the Local Board must be deemed to also apply to an alternative entity used by a local area. (WIA sec. 117(i).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the One-Stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In general, the One-Stop delivery system is a system under which entities responsible for administering separate workforce investment, educational, and other human resource programs and funding streams (referred to as One-Stop partners) collaborate to create a seamless system of service delivery that will enhance access to the programs' services and improve long-term employment outcomes for individuals receiving assistance.</P>
            <P>(b) Title I of WIA assigns responsibilities at the local, State and Federal level to ensure the creation and maintenance of a One-Stop delivery system that enhances the range and quality of workforce development services that are accessible to individuals seeking assistance.</P>
            <P>(c) The system must include at least one comprehensive physical center in each local area that must provide the core services specified in WIA section 134(d)(2), and must provide access to other programs and activities carried out by the One-Stop partners.</P>
            <P>(d) While each local area must have at least one comprehensive center (and may have additional comprehensive centers), WIA section 134(c) allows for arrangements to supplement the center. These arrangements may include:</P>
            <P>(1) A network of affiliated sites that can provide one or more partners' programs, services and activities at each site;</P>
            <P>(2) A network of One-Stop partners through which each partner provides services that are linked, physically or technologically, to an affiliated site that assures individuals are provided information on the availability of core services in the local area; and</P>
            <P>(3) Specialized centers that address specific needs, such as those of dislocated workers.</P>
            <P>(e) The design of the local area's One-Stop delivery system, including the number of comprehensive centers and the supplementary arrangements, must be described in the local plan and be consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding executed with the One-Stop partners.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What other entities may serve as One-Stop partners?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) WIA provides that other entities that carry out a human resource program, including Federal, State, or local programs and programs in the private sector may serve as additional partners in the One-Stop system if the Local Board and chief elected official(s) approve the entity's participation.</P>
            <P>(b) Additional partners may include:</P>

            <P>(1) TANF programs authorized under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

            <P>(5) Other appropriate Federal, State or local programs, including programs related to transportation and housing and programs in the private sector. (WIA sec. 121(b)(2).)</P>
            <P>(c) The State may require that one or more of the programs identified in paragraph (b) of this section be included as a partner in all of the local One-Stop delivery systems in the State.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What entity serves as the One-Stop partner for a particular program in the local area?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The “entity” that carries out the program and activities listed in §§ 662.200 and 662.210 and, therefore, serves as the One-Stop partner is the grant recipient, administrative entity or organization responsible for administering the funds of the specified program in the local area. The term “entity” does not include the service providers that contract with or are subrecipients of the local administrative entity. For programs that do not include local administrative entities, the responsible State Agency should be the partner. Specific entities for particular programs are identified in paragraph (b) of this section. If a program or activity listed in § 662.200 is not carried out in a local area, the requirements relating to a required One-Stop partner are not applicable to such program or activity in that local One-Stop system.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) For title II of WIA, the entity that carries out the program for the <PRTPAGE P="53"/>purposes of paragraph (a) is the State eligible entity. The State eligible entity may designate an eligible provider, or a consortium of eligible providers, as the “entity” for this purpose;</P>
            <P>(2) For title I, Part A, of the Rehabilitation Act, the entity that carries out the program for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is the designated State agency or designated unit specified under section 101(a)(2) that is primarily concerned with vocational rehabilitation, or vocational and other rehabilitation, of individuals with disabilities; and</P>
            <P>(3) Under WIA, the national programs, including Job Corps, the WIA Indian and Native American program, the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers program, and the Veterans' Workforce Investment program, are required One-Stop partners. Local Boards must include them in the One-Stop delivery system where they are present in their local area. In local areas where the national programs are not present, States and Local Boards should take steps to ensure that customer groups served by these programs have access to services through the One-Stop delivery system.</P>

            <P>All required partners must:</P>
            <P>(a) Make available to participants through the One-Stop delivery system the core services that are applicable to the partner's programs; (WIA sec. 121(b)(1)(A).)</P>
            <P>(b) Use a portion of funds made available to the partner's program, to the extent not inconsistent with the Federal law authorizing the partner's program, to:</P>
            <P>(1) Create and maintain the One-Stop delivery system; and</P>
            <P>(2) Provide core services; (WIA sec. 134(d)(1)(B).)</P>
            <P>(c) Enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Local Board relating to the operation of the One-Stop system that meets the requirements of § 662.300, including a description of services, how the cost of the identified services and operating costs of the system will be funded, and methods for referrals (WIA sec. 121(c));</P>
            <P>(d) Participate in the operation of the One-Stop system consistent with the terms of the MOU and requirements of authorizing laws; (WIA sec. 121(b)(1)(B).) and</P>
            <P>(e) Provide representation on the Local Workforce Investment Board. (WIA sec. 117(b)(2)(A)(vi).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are a program's applicable core services?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The core services applicable to any One-Stop partner program are those services described in paragraph (b) of this section, that are authorized and provided under the partner's program.</P>
            <P>(b) The core services identified in section 134(d)(2) of the WIA are:</P>
            <P>(1) Determinations of whether the individuals are eligible to receive assistance under subtitle B of title I of WIA;</P>
            <P>(2) Outreach, intake (which may include worker profiling), and orientation to the information and other services available through the One-Stop delivery system;</P>
            <P>(3) Initial assessment of skill levels, aptitudes, abilities, and supportive service needs;</P>
            <P>(4) Job search and placement assistance, and where appropriate, career counseling;</P>
            <P>(5) Provision of employment statistics information, including the provision of accurate information relating to local, regional, and national labor market areas, including—</P>
            <P>(i) Job vacancy listings in such labor market areas;</P>
            <P>(ii) Information on job skills necessary to obtain the listed jobs; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Information relating to local occupations in demand and the earnings and skill requirements for such occupations;</P>
            <P>(6) Provision of program performance information and program cost information on:</P>
            <P>(i) Eligible providers of training services described in WIA section 122;</P>
            <P>(ii) Eligible providers of youth activities described in WIA section 123;</P>
            <P>(iii) Providers of adult education described in title II;</P>

            <P>(iv) Providers of postsecondary vocational education activities and vocational education activities available to <PRTPAGE P="54"/>school dropouts under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and</P>

            <P>(v) Providers of vocational rehabilitation program activities described in title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 720 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
            <P>(7) Provision of information on how the local area is performing on the local performance measures and any additional performance information with respect to the One-Stop delivery system in the local area;</P>
            <P>(8) Provision of accurate information relating to the availability of supportive services, including, at a minimum, child care and transportation, available in the local area, and referral to such services, as appropriate;</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 662.250</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Where and to what extent must required One-Stop partners make core services available?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) At a minimum, the core services that are applicable to the program of the partner under § 662.220, and that are in addition to the basic labor exchange services traditionally provided in the local area under the Wagner-Peyser program, must be made available at the comprehensive One-Stop center. These services must be made available to individuals attributable to the partner's program who seek assistance at the center. The adult and dislocated worker program partners are required to make all of the core services listed in § 662.240 available at the center in accordance with 20 CFR 663.100(b)(1).</P>
            <P>(b) The applicable core services may be made available by the provision of appropriate technology at the comprehensive One-Stop center, by co-locating personnel at the center, cross-training of staff, or through a cost reimbursement or other agreement between service providers at the comprehensive One-Stop center and the partner, as described in the MOU.</P>
            <P>(c) The responsibility of the partner for the provision of core services must be proportionate to the use of the services at the comprehensive One-Stop center by the individuals attributable to the partner's program. The specific method of determining each partner's proportionate responsibility must be described in the MOU.</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of this part, individuals attributable to the partner's program may include individuals who are referred through the comprehensive One-Stop center and enrolled in the partner's program after the receipt of core services, who have been enrolled in the partner's program prior to receipt of the applicable core services at the center, who meet the eligibility criteria for the partner's program and who receive an applicable core service, or who meet an alternative definition described in the MOU.</P>
            <P>(e) Under the MOU, the provision of applicable core services at the center by the One-Stop partner may be supplemented by the provision of such services through the networks of affiliated sites and networks of One-Stop partners described in WIA section 134(c)(2).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What services, in addition to the applicable core services, are to be provided by One-Stop partners through the One-Stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>

            <P>In addition to the provision of core services, One-Stop partners must provide access to the other activities and programs carried out under the partner's authorizing laws. The access to these services must be described in the local MOU. 20 CFR part 663 describes the specific requirements relating to the provision of core, intensive, and training services through the One-Stop system that apply to the adult and the dislocated worker programs authorized <PRTPAGE P="55"/>under title I of WIA. Additional requirements apply to the provision of all labor exchange services under the Wagner-Peyser Act. (WIA sec. 134(c)(1)(D).)</P>

            <P>The MOU must describe the particular funding arrangements for services and operating costs of the One-Stop delivery system. Each partner must contribute a fair share of the operating costs of the One-Stop delivery system proportionate to the use of the system by individuals attributable to the partner's program. There are a number of methods, consistent with the equirements of the relevant OMB circulars, that may be used for allocating costs among the partners. Some of these methodologies include allocations based on direct charges, cost pooling, indirect cost rates and activity-based cost allocation plans. Additional guidance relating to cost allocation methods may be issued by the Department in consultation with the other appropriate Federal agencies.</P>

            <P>No, the requirements of the partner's program continue to apply. The Act intends to create a seamless service delivery system for individuals seeking workforce development services by linking the One-Stop partners in the One-Stop delivery system. While the overall effect is to provide universal access to core services, the resources of each partner may only be used to provide services that are authorized and provided under the partner's program to individuals who are eligible under such program.

            <SUBJECT>What is the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is an agreement developed and executed between the Local Board, with the agreement of the chief elected official, and the One-Stop partners relating to the operation of the One-Stop delivery system in the local area.</P>
            <P>(b) The MOU must contain the provisions required by WIA section 121(c)(2). These provisions cover services to be provided through the One-Stop delivery system; the funding of the services and operating costs of the system; and methods for referring individuals between the One-Stop operators and partners. The MOU's provisions also must determine the duration and procedures for amending the MOU, and may contain any other provisions that are consistent with WIA title I and the WIA regulations agreed to by the parties.

            <SUBJECT>Is there a single MOU for the local area or are there to be separate MOU's between the Local Board and each partner?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A single “umbrella” MOU may be developed that addresses the issues relating to the local One-Stop delivery system for the Local Board, chief elected official and all partners, or the Local Board, chief elected official and the partners may decide to enter into separate agreements between the Local Board (with the agreement of the chief elected official) and one or more partners. Under either approach, the requirements described in this subpart apply. Since funds are generally appropriated annually, financial agreements may be negotiated with each partner annually to clarify funding of services and operating costs of the system under the MOU.</P>

            <P>(b) WIA emphasizes full and effective partnerships between Local Boards, chief elected officials and One-Stop partners. Local Boards and partners <PRTPAGE P="56"/>must enter into good-faith negotiations. Local Boards, chief elected officials and partners may request assistance from a State agency responsible for administering the partner program, the Governor, State Board, or other appropriate parties. The State agencies, the State Board, and the Governor may also consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to address impasse situations after exhausting other alternatives. The Local Board and partners must document the negotiations and efforts that have taken place. Any failure to execute an MOU between a Local Board and a required partner must be reported by the Local Board and the required partner to the Governor or State Board, and the State agency responsible for administering the partner's program, and by the Governor or the State Board and the responsible State agency to the Secretary of Labor and to the head of any other Federal agency with responsibility for oversight of a partner's program. (WIA sec. 121(c).)</P>
            <P>(c) If an impasse has not been resolved through the alternatives available under this section any partner that fails to execute an MOU may not be permitted to serve on the Local Board. In addition, any local area in which a Local Board has failed to execute an MOU with all of the required partners is not eligible for State incentive grants awarded on the basis of local coordination of activities under 20 CFR 665.200(d)(2). These sanctions are in addition to, not in lieu of, any other remedies that may be applicable to the Local Board or to each partner for failure to comply with the statutory requirement.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 663.100</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the role of the adult and dislocated worker programs in the One-Stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The One-Stop system is the basic delivery system for adult and dislocated worker services. Through this system, adults and dislocated workers can access a continuum of services. The services are organized into three levels: core, intensive, and training.</P>
            <P>(b) The chief elected official or his/her designee(s), as the local grant recipient(s) for the adult and dislocated worker programs, is a required One-Stop partner and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in 20 CFR part 662. Consistent with those provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) Core services for adults and dislocated workers must be made available in at least one comprehensive One-Stop center in each local workforce investment area. Services may also be available elsewhere, either at affiliated sites or at specialized centers. For example, specialized centers may be established to serve workers being dislocated from a particular employer or industry, or to serve residents of public housing.</P>
            <P>(2) The One-Stop centers also make intensive services available to adults and dislocated workers, as needed, either by the One-Stop operator directly or through contracts with service providers that are approved by the Local Board.</P>

            <P>(3) Through the One-Stop system, adults and dislocated workers needing training are provided Individual Training Accounts (ITA's) and access to lists of eligible providers and programs of training. These lists contain quality consumer information, including cost and performance information for each of the providers' programs, so that participants can make informed choices <PRTPAGE P="59"/>on where to use their ITA's. (ITA's are more fully discussed in subpart D of this part.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>When must adults and dislocated workers be registered?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Registration is the process for collecting information to support a determination of eligibility. This information may be collected through methods that include electronic data transfer, personal interview, or an individual's application.</P>
            <P>(b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under title I other than self-service or informational activities must be registered and determined eligible.</P>
            <P>(c) EO data must be collected on every individual who is interested in being considered for WIA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a recipient, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal information in response to a request from the recipient.</P>

            <P>To be eligible to receive core services as an adult in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must be 18 years of age or older. To be eligible for the dislocated worker programs, an eligible adult must meet the criteria of § 663.115. Eligibility criteria for intensive and training services are found at §§ 663.220 and 663.310.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the eligibility criteria for core services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be eligible to receive core services as a dislocated worker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must meet the definition of “dislocated worker” at WIA section 101(9). Eligibility criteria for intensive and training services are found at §§ 663.220 and 663.310.</P>
            <P>(b) Governors and Local Boards may establish policies and procedures for One-Stop operators to use in determining an individual's eligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at WIA section 101(9). These policies and procedures may address such conditions as:</P>
            <P>(1) What constitutes a “general announcement” of plant closing under WIA section 101(9)(B)(ii) or (iii); and</P>
            <P>(2) What constitutes “unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters” for determining the eligibility of self-employed individuals, including family members and farm or ranch hands, under WIA section 101(9)(C).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 663.120</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Are displaced homemakers eligible for dislocated worker activities under WIA?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Yes, there are two significant differences from the eligibility requirements under the Job Training Partnership Act.</P>
            <P>(b) Under the dislocated worker program in JTPA, displaced homemakers are defined as “additional dislocated workers” and are only eligible to receive services if the Governor determines that providing such services would not adversely affect the delivery of services to the other eligible dislocated workers. Under WIA section 101(9), displaced homemakers who meet the definition at WIA section 101(10) are eligible dislocated workers without any additional determination.</P>
            <P>(c) The definition of displaced homemaker under JTPA included individuals who had been dependent upon public assistance under Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as well as those who had been dependent on the income of another family member. The definition in WIA section 101(10) includes only those individuals who were dependent on a family member's income. Those individuals who have been dependent on public assistance may be served in the adult program.</P>

            <P>(a) WIA title I formula funds allocated to local areas for adults and dislocated workers must be used to provide core, intensive and training services through the One-Stop delivery system. Local Boards determine the most appropriate mix of these services, but <PRTPAGE P="60"/>all three types must be available for both adults and dislocated workers. There are different eligibility criteria for each of these types of services, which are described at §§ 663.110, 663.115, 663.220 and 663.310.</P>
            <P>(b) WIA title I funds may also be used to provide the other services described in WIA section 134(e):</P>
            <P>(1) Discretionary One-Stop delivery activities, including:</P>
            <P>(i) Customized screening and referral of qualified participants in training services to employment; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Customized employment-related services to employers on a fee-for-service basis that are in addition to labor exchange services available to employers under the Wagner-Peyser Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Supportive services, including needs-related payments, as described in subpart H of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) Yes, at a minimum, an individual must receive at least one core service, such as an initial assessment or job search and placement assistance, before receiving intensive services. The initial assessment provides preliminary information about the individual's skill levels, aptitudes, interests, and supportive services needs. The job search and placement assistance helps the individual determine whether he or she is unable to obtain employment, and thus requires more intensive services to obtain employment. The decision on which core services to provide, and the timing of their delivery, may be made on a case-by-case basis at the local level depending upon the needs of the participant.</P>
            <P>(b) A determination of the need for intensive services under § 663.220, as established by the initial assessment or the individual's inability to obtain employment through the core services provided, must be contained in the participant's case file.</P>

            <P>The workforce investment system established under WIA emphasizes informed customer choice, system performance, and continuous improvement. The eligible provider process is part of the strategy for achieving these goals. Local Boards, in partnership with the State, identify training providers and programs whose performance qualifies them to receive WIA funds to train adults and dislocated workers. In order to maximize customer choice and assure that all significant population groups are served, States and local areas should administer the eligible provider process in a manner to assure that significant numbers of competent providers, offering a wide variety of training programs and occupational choices, are available to customers. After receiving core and intensive services and in consultation with case managers, eligible participants who need training use the list of these eligible providers to make an informed choice. The ability of providers to successfully perform, the procedures State and Local Boards use to establish eligibility, and the degree to which information, including performance information, on those providers is made available to customers eligible for training services, are key factors affecting the successful implementation of the Statewide workforce investment system. This subpart describes the process for determining eligible training providers.</P>

            <P>(a) To be eligible to receive adult or dislocated worker training funds under title I of WIA, all providers must submit applications to the Local Boards in the areas in which they wish to provide services. The application must describe each program of training services to be offered.<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) For programs eligible under title IV of the Higher Education Act and apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act (NAA), and the providers or such programs, Local Boards determine the procedures to use in making an application. The procedures established by the Local Board must specify the timing, manner, and contents of the required application.</P>
            <P>(c) For programs not eligible under title IV of the HEA or registered under the NAA, and for providers not eligible under title IV of the HEA or carrying out apprenticeship programs under NAA:</P>
            <P>(1) The Governor must develop a procedure for use by Local Boards for determining the eligibility of other providers, after</P>
            <P>(i) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from Local Boards and providers of training services within the State;</P>
            <P>(ii) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, including representatives of business and labor organizations, to submit comments on the procedure; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local Boards and provider, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.</P>
            <P>(2) The procedure must be described in the State Plan.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) The procedure must require that the provider must submit an application to the Local Board at such time and in such manner as may be required, which contains a description of the program of training services;</P>
            <P>(ii) If the provider provides a program of training services on the date of application, the procedure must require that the application include an appropriate portion of the performance information and program cost information described in § 663.540, and that the program meet appropriate levels of performance;</P>
            <P>(iii) If the provider does not provide a program of training services on that date, the procedure must require that the provider meet appropriate requirements specified in the procedure. (WIA sec. 122(b)(2)(D).)</P>
            <P>(d) The Local Board must include providers that meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section on a local list and submit the list to the designated State agency. The State agency has 30 days to determine that the provider or its programs do not meet the requirements relating to the providers under paragraph (c) of this section. After the agency determines that the provider and its programs meet(s) the criteria for initial eligibility, or 30 days have elapsed, whichever occurs first, the provider and its programs are initially eligible. The programs and providers submitted under paragraph (b) of this section are initially eligible without State agency review. (WIA sec. 122(e).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>Is there a time limit on the period of initial eligibility for training providers?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes, under WIA section 122(c)(5), the Governor must require training providers to submit performance information and meet performance levels annually in order to remain eligible providers. States may require that these performance requirements be met one year from the date that initial eligibility was determined, or may require all eligible providers to submit performance information by the same date each year. If the latter approach is adopted, the Governor may exempt eligible providers whose determination of initial eligibility occurs within six months of the date of submissions. The effect of this requirement is that no training provider may have a period of initial eligibility that exceeds eighteen months. In the limited circumstance when insufficient data is available, initial eligibility may be extended for a period of up to six additional months, if the Governor's procedures provide for such an extension.</P>

            <P>(3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local Boards and providers, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.</P>
            <P>(b) The procedure must be described in the State Plan.</P>
            <P>(c) The procedure must require that:</P>
            <P>(1) Providers annually submit performance and cost information as described at WIA section 122(d)(1) and (2), for each program of training services for which the provider has been determined to be eligible, in a time and manner determined by the Local Board;</P>
            <P>(2) Providers and programs annually meet minimum performance levels described at WIA section 122(c)(6), as demonstrated utilizing UI quarterly wage records where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(d) The program's performance information must meet the minimum acceptable levels established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to remain eligible;</P>
            <P>(e) Local Boards may require higher levels of performance for local programs than the levels specified in the procedures established by the Governor. (WIA sec.122(c)(5) and (c)(6).)</P>
            <P>(f) The State procedure must require Local Boards to take into consideration:</P>
            <P>(1) The specific economic, geographic and demographic factors in the local areas in which providers seeking eligibility are located, and</P>
            <P>(2) The characteristics of the populations served by programs seeking eligibility, including the demonstrated difficulties in serving these populations, where applicable.</P>
            <P>(g) The Local Board retains those programs on the local list that meet the required performance levels and other elements of the State procedures and submits the list, accompanied by the performance and cost information, and any additional required information, to the designated State agency. If the designated State agency determines within 30 days from the receipt of the information that the program does not meet the performance levels established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the program may be removed from the list. A program retained on the local list and not removed by the designated State agency is considered an eligible program of training services.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What kind of performance and cost information is required for determinations of subsequent eligibility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Eligible providers of training services must submit, at least annually, under procedures established by the Governor under § 663.535(c):</P>
            <P>(1) Verifiable program-specific performance information, including:</P>
            <P>(i) The information described in WIA section 122(d)(1)(A)(i) for all individuals participating in the programs of training services, including individuals who are not receiving assistance under WIA section 134 and individuals who are receiving such assistance; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The information described in WIA section 122(d)(1)(A)(ii) relating only to individuals receiving assistance under the WIA adult and dislocated worker program who are participating in the applicable program of training services; and</P>
            <P>(2) Information on program costs (such as tuition and fees) for WIA participants in the program.</P>
            <P>(b) Governors may require any additional verifiable performance information (such as the information described at WIA section 122(d)(2)) that the Governor determines to be appropriate to obtain subsequent eligibility, including information regarding all participating individuals as well as individuals receiving assistance under the WIA adult and dislocated worker program.</P>

            <P>(c) Governors must establish procedures by which providers can demonstrate if the additional information required under paragraph (b) of this section imposes extraordinary costs on providers, or if providers experience extraordinary costs in the collection of <PRTPAGE P="68"/>information. If, through these procedures, providers demonstrate that they experience such extraordinary costs:</P>
            <P>(1) The Governor or Local Board must provide access to cost-effective methods for the collection of the information; or</P>
            <P>(2) The Governor must provide additional resources to assist providers in the collection of the information from funds for Statewide workforce investment activities reserved under WIA sections 128(a) and 133(a)(1).</P>
            <P>(d) The Local Board and the designated State agency may accept program-specific performance information consistent with the requirements for eligibility under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 from a provider for purposes of enabling the provider to fulfill the applicable requirements of this section, if the information is substantially similar to the information otherwise required under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Yes. A training provider must deliver results and provide accurate information in order to retain its status as an eligible training provider.</P>
            <P>(b) If the provider's programs do not meet the established performance levels, the programs will be removed from the eligible provider list.</P>
            <P>(1) A Local Board must determine, during the subsequent eligibility determination process, whether a provider's programs meet performance levels. If the program fails to meet such levels, the program must be removed from the local list. If all of the provider's programs fail to meet such levels, the provider must be removed from the local list.</P>
            <P>(2) The designated State agency upon receipt of the performance information accompanying the local list, may remove programs from the State list if the agency determines the program failed to meet the levels of performance prescribed under § 663.535(c). If all of the provider's programs are determined to have failed to meet the levels, the designated State agency may remove the provider from the State list.</P>

            <P>(3) Providers determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have subsequently violated any provision of title I of WIA or the WIA regulations, including 29 CFR part 37, may be removed from the list in accordance with the enforcement provisions of WIA section 122(f). A provider whose eligibility is terminated under these conditions is liable to repay all adult and dislocated worker training funds it received during the period of noncompliance.<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) The Governor must establish appeal procedures for providers of training to appeal a denial of eligibility under this subpart according to the requirements of 20 CFR 667.640(b).</P>

It is built upon the State list of eligible providers and programs developed through the procedures described in WIA section 122 and this subpart. The consumer reports system must contain the information necessary for an adult or dislocated worker customer to fully understand the options available to him or her in choosing a program of training services. Such program-specific factors may include overall performance, performance for significant customer groups (including wage replacement rates for dislocated workers), performance of specific provider sites, current information on employment and wage trends and projections, and duration of training programs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What priority must be given to low-income adults and public assistance recipients served with adult funds under title I?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) WIA states, in section 134(d)(4)(E), that in the event that funds allocated to a local area for adult employment <PRTPAGE P="70"/>and training activities are limited, priority for intensive and training services funded with title I adult funds must be given to recipients of public assistance and other low-income individuals in the local area.</P>
            <P>(b) Since funding is generally limited, States and local areas must establish criteria by which local areas can determine the availability of funds and the process by which any priority will be applied under WIA section 134(d)(2)(E). Such criteria may include the availability of other funds for providing employment and training-related services in the local area, the needs of the specific groups within the local area, and other appropriate factors.</P>
            <P>(c) States and local areas must give priority for adult intensive and training services to recipients of public assistance and other low-income individuals, unless the local area has determined that funds are not limited under the criteria established under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) The process for determining whether to apply the priority established under paragraph (b) of this section does not necessarily mean that only the recipients of public assistance and other low income individuals may receive WIA adult funded intensive and training services when funds are determined to be limited in a local area. The Local Board and the Governor may establish a process that gives priority for services to the recipients of public assistance and other low income individuals and that also serves other individuals meeting eligibility requirements.</P>

            <P>(a) The local Welfare-to-Work (WtW) program operator is a required partner in the One-Stop delivery system. 20 CFR part 662 describes the roles of such partners in the One-Stop delivery system and applies to the Welfare-to-Work program operator. WtW programs serve individuals who may also be served by the WIA programs and, through appropriate linkages and referrals, these customers will have access to a broader range of services through the cooperation of the WtW program in the One-Stop system. WtW participants, who are determined to be WIA eligible, and who need occupational skills training may be referred through the One-Stop system to receive WIA training, when WtW grant and other grant funds are not available in accordance with § 663.320(a). WIA participants who are also determined WtW eligible, may be referred to the WtW operator for job placement and other WtW assistance.</P>
            <P>(b) The local TANF agency is specifically suggested under WIA as an additional partner in the One-Stop system. TANF recipients will have access to more information about employment opportunities and services when the TANF agency participates in the One-Stop delivery system. The Governor and Local Board should encourage the TANF agency to become a One-Stop partner to improve the quality of services to the WtW and TANF-eligible populations. In addition, becoming a One-Stop partner will ensure that the TANF agency is represented on the Local Board and participates in developing workforce investment strategies that help cash assistance recipients secure lasting employment.</P>

            <P>Supportive services for adults and dislocated workers are defined at WIA sections 101(46) and 134(e)(2) and (3). They include services such as transportation, child care, dependent care, housing, and needs-related payments, that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in activities authorized under WIA title I. Local Boards, in consultation with the One-Stop partners and other community service providers, must develop a policy on supportive services that ensures resource and service coordination in the local area. Such policy should address procedures for referral to such services, including how such services will be funded when they are not otherwise available from other sources. The provision of accurate information about the availability of supportive services in the local area, as well as referral to such activities, is one of the core services that must be available to adults and dislocated workers through the One-Stop delivery system.

            <P>An out-of-school youth is an individual who:</P>
            <P>(a) Is an eligible youth who is a school dropout; or</P>
            <P>(b) Is an eligible youth who has either graduated from high school or holds a GED, but is basic skills deficient, unemployed, or underemployed. (WIA sec. 101(33).)</P>

            <P>A school dropout is defined as an individual who is no longer attending any school and who has not received a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent. A youth's dropout status is determined at the time of registration. A youth attending an alternative school at the time of registration is not a dropout. An individual who is out-of school at the time of registration and subsequently placed in an alternative school, may be considered an out-of-school youth for the purposes of the 30 percent expenditure requirement for out-of-school youth.

            <P>(3) Provide preparation for postsecondary educational opportunities, provide linkages between academic and occupational learning, provide preparation for employment, and provide effective connections to intermediary organizations that provide strong links to the job market and employers.</P>

            <P>(4) The requirement in WIA section 123 that eligible providers of youth services be selected by awarding a grant or contract on a competitive basis does not apply to the design framework component, such as services for intake, objective assessment and the development of individual service strategy, when these services are provided by the grant recipient/fiscal agent.<PRTPAGE P="77"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) The local plan must describe the design framework for youth program design in the local area, and how the ten program elements required in § 664.410 are provided within that framework.</P>

            <P>(f) Local Boards must ensure that parents, youth participants, and other members of the community with experience relating to youth programs are involved in both the design and implementation of its youth programs.</P>
            <P>(g) The objective assessment required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the individual service strategy required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not required if the program provider determines that it is appropriate to use a recent objective assessment or individual service strategy that was developed under another education or training program.

            <SUBJECT>What are work experiences for youth?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Work experiences are planned, structured learning experiences that take place in a workplace for a limited period of time. As provided in WIA section 129(c)(2)(D) and § 664.470, work experiences may be paid or unpaid.</P>
            <P>(b) Work experience workplaces may be in the private, for-profit sector; the non-profit sector; or the public sector.</P>

            <P>(c) Work experiences are designed to enable youth to gain exposure to the working world and its requirements. Work experiences are appropriate and desirable activities for many youth throughout the year. Work experiences should help youth acquire the personal attributes, knowledge, and skills needed to obtain a job and advance in employment. The purpose is to provide <PRTPAGE P="79"/>the youth participant with the opportunities for career exploration and skill development and is not to benefit the employer, although the employer may, in fact, benefit from the activities performed by the youth. Work experiences may be subsidized or unsubsidized and may include the following elements:</P>
            <P>(1) Instruction in employability skills or generic workplace skills such as those identified by the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS);</P>
            <P>(2) Exposure to various aspects of an industry;</P>
            <P>(3) Progressively more complex tasks;</P>
            <P>(4) Internships and job shadowing;</P>
            <P>(5) The integration of basic academic skills into work activities;</P>
            <P>(6) Supported work, work adjustment, and other transition activities;</P>
            <P>(7) Entrepreneurship;</P>
            <P>(8) Service learning;</P>
            <P>(9) Paid and unpaid community service; and</P>
            <P>(10) Other elements designed to achieve the goals of work experiences.</P>
            <P>(d) In most cases, on-the-job training is not an appropriate work experiences activity for youth participants under age 18. Local program operators may choose, however, to use this service strategy for eligible youth when it is appropriate based on the needs identified by the objective assessment of an individual youth participant.

The chief elected officials (which may include local government units operating as a consortium) are the grant recipients for local youth funds, unless another entity is chosen to be grant recipient or fiscal agent under WIA section 117(d)(3)(B). If, in the administration of the summer employment opportunities element of the local youth program, providers other than the grant recipient/fiscal agent, are used to provide summer youth employment opportunities, these providers must be selected by awarding a grant or contract on a competitive basis, based on the recommendation of the youth council and on criteria contained in the State Plan.

            <SUBJECT>What are rapid response activities and who is responsible for providing them?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Rapid response activities are described in §§ 665.310 through 665.330. They encompass the activities necessary to plan and deliver services to enable dislocated workers to transition to new employment as quickly as possible, following either a permanent closure or mass layoff, or a natural or other disaster resulting in a mass job dislocation.</P>
            <P>(b) The State is responsible for providing rapid response activities. Rapid response is a required activity carried out in local areas by the State, or an entity designated by the State, in conjunction with the Local Board and chief elected officials. The State must establish methods by which to provide additional assistance to local areas that experience disasters, mass layoffs, plant closings, or other dislocation events when such events substantially increase the number of unemployed individuals.</P>

            <P>(c) States must establish a rapid response dislocated worker unit to carry <PRTPAGE P="84"/>out Statewide rapid response activities. (WIA secs. 101(38), 112(b)(17)(A)(ii) and 134(a)(2)(A).)</P>

            <P>Rapid response activities must include:</P>
            <P>(a) Immediate and on-site contact with the employer, representatives of the affected workers, and the local community, which may include an assessment of the:</P>
            <P>(1) Layoff plans and schedule of the employer;</P>
            <P>(2) Potential for averting the layoff(s) in consultation with State or local economic development agencies, including private sector economic development entities;</P>
            <P>(3) Background and probable assistance needs of the affected workers;</P>
            <P>(4) Reemployment prospects for workers in the local community; and</P>
            <P>(5) Available resources to meet the short and long-term assistance needs of the affected workers.</P>

            <P>(b) The provision of information and access to unemployment compensation benefits, comprehensive One-Stop system services, and employment and training activities, including information on the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program and the NAFTA-TAA program (19 U.S.C. 2271 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
            <P>(c) The provision of guidance and/or financial assistance in establishing a labor-management committee voluntarily agreed to by labor and management, or a workforce transition committee comprised of representatives of the employer, the affected workers and the local community. The committee may devise and oversee an implementation strategy that responds to the reemployment needs of the workers. The assistance to this committee may include:</P>
            <P>(1) The provision of training and technical assistance to members of the committee;</P>
            <P>(2) Funding the operating costs of a committee to enable it to provide advice and assistance in carrying out rapid response activities and in the design and delivery of WIA-authorized services to affected workers. Typically, such support will last no longer than six months; and</P>
            <P>(3) Providing a list of potential candidates to serve as a neutral chairperson of the committee.</P>
            <P>(d) The provision of emergency assistance adapted to the particular closing, layoff or disaster.</P>
            <P>(e) The provision of assistance to the local board and chief elected official(s) to develop a coordinated response to the dislocation event and, as needed, obtain access to State economic development assistance. Such coordinated response may include the development of an application for National Emergency Grant under 20 CFR part 671. (WIA secs. 101(38) and 134(a)(2)(A).)</P>

            <P>Yes, a State or designated entity may provide rapid response activities in addition to the activities required to be provided under § 665.310. In order to provide effective rapid response upon notification of a permanent closure or mass layoff, or a natural or other disaster resulting in a mass job dislocation, the State or designated entity may:</P>
            <P>(a) In conjunction, with other appropriate Federal, State and Local agencies and officials, employer associations, technical councils or other industry business councils, and labor organizations:</P>
            <P>(1) Develop prospective strategies for addressing dislocation events, that ensure rapid access to the broad range of allowable assistance;</P>
            <P>(2) Identify strategies for the aversion of layoffs; and</P>
            <P>(3) Develop and maintain mechanisms for the regular exchange of information relating to potential dislocations, available adjustment assistance, and the effectiveness of rapid response strategies.</P>

            <P>(b) In collaboration with the appropriate State agency(ies), collect and analyze information related to economic dislocations, including potential closings and layoffs, and all available resources in the State for dislocated workers in order to provide an adequate basis for effective program management, review and evaluation of rapid response and layoff aversion efforts in the State.<PRTPAGE P="85"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) Participate in capacity building activities, including providing information about innovative and successful strategies for serving dislocated workers, with local areas serving smaller layoffs.</P>
            <P>(d) Assist in devising and overseeing strategies for:</P>
            <P>(1) Layoff aversion, such as prefeasibility studies of avoiding a plant closure through an option for a company or group, including the workers, to purchase the plant or company and continue it in operation;</P>
            <P>(2) Incumbent worker training, including employer loan programs for employee skill upgrading; and</P>

            <P>The Governor must ensure that rapid response activities under WIA are made available to workers who, under the NAFTA Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182), are members of a group of workers (including those in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) for which the Governor has made a preliminary finding that:</P>
            <P>(a) A significant number or proportion of the workers in such firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated; and</P>
            <P>(b) Either:</P>
            <P>(1) The sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely; and</P>
            <P>(2) Imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by such firm or subdivision have increased; or</P>

            <P>Up to 25 percent of dislocated worker funds may be reserved for rapid response activities. Once the State has reserved adequate funds for rapid response activities, such as those described in §§ 665.310 and 665.320, the remainder of the funds may be used by the State to provide funds to local areas, that experience increased numbers of unemployed individuals due to natural disasters, plant closings, mass layoffs or other events, for provision of direct services to participants (such as intensive, training, and other services) if there are not adequate local funds available to assist the dislocated workers.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What performance indicators must be included in a State's plan?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All States submitting a State Plan under WIA title I, subtitle B must propose expected levels of performance for each of the core indicators of performance for the adult, dislocated worker and youth programs, respectively and the two customer satisfaction indicators.</P>
            <P>(1) For the Adult program, these indicators are:</P>
            <P>(i) Entry into unsubsidized employment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Retention in unsubsidized employment six months after entry into the employment;</P>
            <P>(iii) Earnings received in unsubsidized employment six months after entry into the employment; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Attainment of a recognized credential related to achievement of educational skills (such as a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent), or occupational skills, by participants who enter unsubsidized employment.</P>
            <P>(2) For the Dislocated Worker program, these indicators are:</P>
            <P>(i) Entry into unsubsidized employment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Retention in unsubsidized employment six months after entry into the employment;</P>
            <P>(iii) Earnings received in unsubsidized employment six months after entry into the employment; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Attainment of a recognized credential related to achievement of educational skills (such as a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent), or occupational skills, by participants who enter unsubsidized employment.</P>
            <P>(3) For the Youth program, these indicators are:</P>
            <P>(i) For eligible youth aged 14 through 18:</P>
            <P>(A) Attainment of basic skills goals, and, as appropriate, work readiness or occupational skills goals, up to a maximum of three goals per year;</P>
            <P>(B) Attainment of secondary school diplomas and their recognized equivalents; and</P>
            <P>(C) Placement and retention in postsecondary education, advanced training, military service, employment, or qualified apprenticeships.</P>
            <P>(ii) For eligible youth aged 19 through 21:</P>
            <P>(A) Entry into unsubsidized employment;</P>
            <P>(B) Retention in unsubsidized employment six months after entry into the employment;</P>
            <P>(C) Earnings received in unsubsidized employment six months after entry into the employment; and</P>
            <P>(D) Attainment of a recognized credential related to achievement of educational skills (such as a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent), or occupational skills, by participants who enter post-secondary education, advanced training, or unsubsidized employment.</P>
            <P>(4) A single customer satisfaction measure for employers and a single customer satisfaction indicator for participants must be used for the WIA title I, subtitle B programs for adults, dislocated workers and youth. (WIA sec. 136(b)(2).)</P>

            <P>(b) After consultation with the representatives identified in WIA sections 136(i) and 502(b), the Departments of <PRTPAGE P="87"/>Labor and Education will issue definitions for the performance indicators established under title I and title II of WIA. (WIA sec. 136 (b), (f) and (i).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>May a Governor require additional indicators of performance?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes, Governors may develop additional indicators of performance for adults, youth and dislocated worker activities. These indicators must be included in the State Plan. (WIA sec. 136(b)(2)(C).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the procedures for negotiating annual levels of performance?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) We issue instructions on the specific information that must accompany the State Plan and that is used to review the State's expected levels of performance. The instructions may require that levels of performance for years two and three be expressed as a percentage improvement over the immediately preceding year's performance, consistent with the objective of continuous improvement.</P>
            <P>(b) States must submit expected levels of performance for the required indicators for each of the first three program years covered by the Plan.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary and the Governor must reach agreement on levels of performance for each core indicator and the customer satisfaction indicators. In negotiating these levels, the following must be taken into account:</P>
            <P>(1) The expected levels of performance identified in the State Plan;</P>
            <P>(2) The extent to which the levels of performance for each core indicator assist in achieving high customer satisfaction;</P>
            <P>(3) The extent to which the levels of performance promote continuous improvement and ensure optimal return on the investment of Federal funds; and</P>
            <P>(4) How the levels compare with those of other States, taking into account factors including differences in economic conditions, participant characteristics, and the proposed service mix and strategies.</P>
            <P>(d) The levels of performance agreed to under paragraph (c) of this section will be the State's negotiated levels of performance for the first three years of the State Plan. These levels will be used to determine whether sanctions will be applied or incentive grant funds will be awarded.</P>
            <P>(e) Before the fourth year of the State Plan, the Secretary and the Governor must reach agreement on levels of performance for each core indicator and the customer satisfaction indicators for the fourth and fifth years covered by the plan. In negotiating these levels, the factors listed in paragraph (c) of this section must be taken into account.</P>
            <P>(f) The levels of performance agreed to under paragraph (e) of this section will be the State negotiated levels of performance for the fourth and fifth years of the plan and must be incorporated into the State Plan.</P>
            <P>(g) Levels of performance for the additional indicators developed by the Governor, including additional indicators to demonstrate and measure continuous improvement toward goals identified by the State, are not part of the negotiations described in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section. (WIA sec. 136(b)(3).)</P>
            <P>(h) State negotiated levels of performance may be revised in accordance with § 666.130.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 666.130</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Under what conditions may a State or DOL request revisions to the State negotiated levels of performance?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The DOL guidelines describe when and under what circumstances a Governor may request revisions to negotiated levels. These circumstances include significant changes in economic conditions, in the characteristics of participants entering the program, or in the services to be provided from when the initial plan was submitted and approved. (WIA sec. 136(b)(3)(A)(vi).)</P>
            <P>(b) The guidelines will establish the circumstances under which a State will be required to submit revisions under specified circumstances.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 666.140</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Which individuals receiving services are included in the core indicators of performance?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a)(1) The core indicators of performance apply to all individuals who are registered under 20 CFR 663.105 and 664.215 for the adult, dislocated worker <PRTPAGE P="88"/>and youth programs, except for those adults and dislocated workers who participate exclusively in self-service or informational activities. (WIA sec. 136(b)(2)(A).)</P>
            <P>(2) Self-service and informational activities are those core services that are made available and accessible to the general public, that are designed to inform and educate individuals about the labor market and their employment strengths, weaknesses, and the range of services appropriate to their situation, and that do not require significant staff involvement with the individual in terms of resources or time.</P>
            <P>(b) For registered participants, a standardized record that includes appropriate performance information must be maintained in accordance with WIA section 185(a)(3).</P>
            <P>(c) Performance will be measured on the basis of results achieved by registered participants, and will reflect services provided under WIA title I, subtitle B programs for adults, dislocated workers and youth. Performance may also take into account services provided to participants by other One-Stop partner programs and activities, to the extent that the local MOU provides for the sharing of participant information.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 666.150</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What responsibility do States have to use quarterly wage record information for performance accountability?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) States must, consistent with State laws, use quarterly wage record information in measuring the progress on State and local performance measures. In order to meet this requirement the use of social security numbers from registered participants and such other information as is necessary to measure the progress of those participants through quarterly wage record information is authorized.</P>
            <P>(b) The State must include in the State Plan a description of the State's performance accountability system, and a description of the State's strategy for using quarterly wage record information to measure the progress on State and local performance measures. The description must identify the entities that may have access to quarterly wage record information for this purpose.</P>
            <P>(c) “Quarterly wage record information” means information regarding wages paid to an individual, the social security account number (or numbers, if more than one) of the individual and the name, address, State, and (when known) the Federal employer identification number of the employer paying the wages to the individual.

            <P>(a) We determine the total amount to be allocated from funds available under WIA section 174(b) for Incentive Grants taking into consideration such factors as:</P>
            <P>(1) The availability of funds under section 174(b) for technical assistance, demonstration and pilot projects, evaluations, and Incentive Grants and the needs for these activities;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances may a sanction be applied to a State that fails to achieve negotiated levels of performance for title I?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If a State fails to meet the negotiated levels of performance agreed to under § 666.120 for core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for the adult, dislocated worker or youth programs under title I <PRTPAGE P="90"/>of WIA, the Secretary must, upon request, provide technical assistance, as authorized under WIA sections 136(g) and 170.</P>
            <P>(b) If a State fails to meet the negotiated levels of performance for core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for the same program in two successive years, the amount of the succeeding year's allocation for the applicable program may be reduced by up to five percent.</P>
            <P>(c) The exact amount of any allocation reduction will be based upon the degree of failure to meet the negotiated levels of performance for core indicators. In making a determination of the amount, if any, of such a sanction, we may consider factors such as:</P>
            <P>(1) The State's performance relative to other States;</P>
            <P>(2) Improvement efforts underway;</P>
            <P>(3) Incremental improvement on the performance measures;</P>
            <P>(4) Technical assistance previously provided;</P>
            <P>(5) Changes in economic conditions and program design;</P>
            <P>(6) The characteristics of participants served compared to the participant characteristics described in the State Plan; and</P>
            <P>(7) Performance on other core indicators of performance and customer satisfaction indicators for that program. (WIA sec. 136(g).)</P>
            <P>(d) Only performance that is less than 80 percent of the negotiated levels will be deemed to be a failure to achieve negotiated levels of performance.</P>
            <P>(e) In accordance with 20 CFR 667.300(e), a State grant may be reduced for failure to submit an annual performance progress report.</P>
            <P>(f) A State may request review of a sanction we impose in accordance with the provisions of 20 CFR 667.800.</P>

            <P>(a) If a local area fails to meet the levels of performance agreed to under § 666.310 for the core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for a program in any program year, technical assistance must be provided. The technical assistance must be provided by the Governor with funds reserved for Statewide workforce investment activities under WIA sections 128(a) and 133(a)(1), or, upon the Governor's request, by the Secretary. The technical assistance may include the development of a performance improvement plan, a modified local plan, or other actions designed to assist the local area in improving performance.</P>
            <P>(b) If a local area fails to meet the levels of performance agreed to under § 666.310 for the core indicators of performance or customer satisfaction indicators for a program for two consecutive program years, the Governor must take corrective actions. The corrective actions may include the development of a reorganization plan under which the Governor:</P>
            <P>(1) Requires the appointment and certification of a new Local Board;</P>
            <P>(2) Prohibits the use of particular service providers or One-Stop partners that have been identified as achieving poor levels of performance; or</P>
            <P>(3) Requires other appropriate measures designed to improve the performance of the local area.</P>
            <P>(c) A local area may appeal to the Governor to rescind or revise a reorganization plan imposed under paragraph (b) of this section not later than thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the plan. The Governor must make a final decision within 30 days after receipt of the appeal. The Governor's final decision may be appealed by the Local Board to the Secretary under 20 CFR 667.650(b) not later than thirty (30) days after the local area receives the decision. The decision by the Governor to impose a reorganization plan becomes effective at the time it is issued, and remains effective unless the Secretary rescinds or revises the reorganization plan. Upon receipt of the appeal from the local area, the Secretary must make a final decision within thirty (30) days. (WIA sec. 136(h).)</P>

Funds reserved under this paragraph may be combined and spent on Statewide employment and training activities, for adults and dislocated workers, and Statewide youth activities, as described in 20 CFR 665.200 and 665.210, without regard to the funding source of the reserved funds.</P>
            <P>(2) The Governor must reserve a portion of the dislocated worker funds for Statewide rapid response activities, as described in WIA section 134(a)(2)(A) and 20 CFR 665.310 through 665.330.

            <P>(a) The first reallotment of funds among States will occur during PY 2001 based on obligations in PY 2000.</P>
            <P>(b) The Secretary determines, during the first quarter of the program year, whether a State has obligated its required level of at least 80 percent of the funds allotted under WIA sections 127 and 132 for programs serving youth, adults, and dislocated workers for the prior year, as separately determined for each of the three funding streams. Unobligated balances are determined based on allotments adjusted for any allowable transfer between the adult and dislocated worker funding streams. The amount to be recaptured from each State for reallotment, if any, is based on State obligations of the funds allotted to each State under WIA sections 127 and 132 for programs serving youth, adults, or dislocated workers, less any amount reserved (up to 5 percent at the State level and up to 10 percent at the local level) for the costs of administration. This amount, if any, is separately determined for each funding stream.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary reallots youth, adult and dislocated worker funds among eligible States in accordance with the provisions of WIA sections 127(c) and 132(c), respectively. To be eligible to receive a reallotment of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds under the reallotment procedures, a State must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior program year's allotment, less any amount reserved for the costs of administration of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds. A State's eligibility to receive a reallotment is separately determined for each funding stream.</P>
            <P>(d) The term “obligation” is defined at 20 CFR 660.300. For purposes of this section, the Secretary will also treat as State obligations:</P>

If the Governor chooses to reallocate funds, the provisions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply.</P>
            <P>(b) For the youth, adult and dislocated worker programs, the amount to be recaptured from each local area for purposes of reallocation, if any, must be based on the amount by which the prior year's unobligated balance of allocated funds exceeds 20 percent of that year's allocation for the program, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration. Unobligated balances must be determined based on allocations adjusted for any allowable transfer between funding streams. This amount, if any, must be separately determined for each funding stream.</P>

As part of this review, we may consider any information that has come to our attention and will consider the organization's history with regard to the management of other grants, including DOL grants. The failure to meet any one responsibility test, except for those listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, does not establish that the organization is not responsible unless the failure is substantial or persistent (for two or more consecutive years). The responsibility tests include:</P>
            <P>(1) The organization's efforts to recover debts (for which three demand letters have been sent) established by final agency action have been unsuccessful, or that there has been failure to comply with an approved repayment plan;</P>
            <P>(2) Established fraud or criminal activity of a significant nature within the organization.</P>
            <P>(3) Serious administrative deficiencies that we identify, such as failure to maintain a financial management system as required by Federal regulations;</P>

            <P>(7) Failure to return a grant closeout package or outstanding advances within 90 days of the grant expiration date or receipt of closeout package, whichever is later, unless an extension has been requested and granted; final billings reflecting serious cost category or total budget cost overrun;</P>
            <P>(8) Failure to submit required reports;</P>
            <P>(9) Failure to properly report and dispose of government property as instructed by DOL;</P>
            <P>(10) Failure to have maintained effective cash management or cost controls resulting in excess cash on hand;</P>
            <P>(11) Failure to ensure that a subrecipient complies with its OMB Circular A-133 audit requirements specified at § 667.200(b);</P>
            <P>(12) Failure to audit a subrecipient within the required period;</P>
            <P>(13) Final disallowed costs in excess of five percent of the grant or contract award if, in the judgement of the grant officer, the disallowances are egregious findings and;</P>
            <P>(14) Failure to establish a mechanism to resolve a subrecipient's audit in a timely fashion.</P>
            <P>(b) This responsibility review is independent of the competitive process. Applicants which are determined to be not responsible will not be selected as potential grantees irrespective of their standing in the competition.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Resolution of subrecipient-level findings.</E> (1) The Governor is responsible for resolving findings that arise from the State's monitoring reviews, investigations and audits (including OMB Circular A-133 audits) of subrecipients.</P>
            <P>(2) A State must utilize the audit resolution, debt collection and appeal procedures that it uses for other Federal grant programs.</P>
            <P>(3) If a State does not have such procedures, it must prescribe standards and procedures to be used for this grant program.</P>

            <P>(2) The Secretary uses the DOL audit resolution process, consistent with the Single Audit Act of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, and Grant Officer Resolution provisions of § 667.510, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(3) A final determination issued by a Grant Officer under this process may be appealed to the DOL Office of Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at § 667.800.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do we resolve investigative and monitoring findings?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a result of an investigation, on-site visit or other monitoring, we notify the recipient of the findings of the investigation and gives the recipient a period of time (not more than 60 days) to comment and to take appropriate corrective actions.</P>
            <P>(b) The Grant Officer reviews the complete file of the investigation or monitoring report and the recipient's actions under paragraph (a) of this section. The Grant Officer's review takes into account the sanction provisions of WIA section 184(b) and (c). If the Grant Officer agrees with the recipient's handling of the situation, the Grant Officer so notifies the recipient. This notification constitutes final agency action.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Grant Officer disagrees with the recipient's handling of the matter, the Grant Officer proceeds under § 667.510.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 667.510</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the Grant Officer resolution process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the State's disposition of an audit or other resolution of violations (including those arising out of incident reports or compliance reviews), or with the recipient's response to findings resulting from investigations or monitoring report, the initial and final determination process, set forth in this section, is used to resolve the matter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The Grant Officer makes an initial determination on the findings for both those matters where there is agreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's resolution, including the allowability of questioned costs or activities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements of the Act and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the grants, contracts, or other agreements under the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Informal resolution.</E> Except in an emergency situation, when the Secretary invokes the authority described in WIA section 184(e), the Grant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part, nor institute corrective actions or sanctions, without first providing the recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments to resolve informally those matters in controversy contained in the initial determination. The initial determination must provide for an informal resolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the initial determination. If the matters are resolved informally, the Grant Officer must <PRTPAGE P="109"/>issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this section which notifies the parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may close the file.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Grant Officer's final determination.</E> (1) If the matter is not fully resolved informally, the Grant Officer provides each party with a written final determination by certified mail, return receipt requested. For audits of recipient-level entities and other recipients which receive WIA funds directly from DOL, ordinarily, the final determination is issued not later than 180 days from the date that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved audit report to the Employment and Training Administration. For audits of subrecipients conducted by the OIG, ordinarily the final determination is issued not later than 360 days from the date the OIG issues the final approved audit report to ETA.</P>
            <P>(2) A final determination under this paragraph (d) must:</P>
            <P>(i) Indicate whether efforts to informally resolve matters contained in the initial determination have been unsuccessful;</P>
            <P>(ii) List those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;</P>
            <P>(iii) List any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions set forth in the initial determination and the rationale for such modifications;</P>
            <P>(iv) Establish a debt, if appropriate;</P>
            <P>(v) Require corrective action, when needed;</P>
            <P>(vi) Determine liability, method of restitution of funds and sanctions; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Offer an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with § 667.800 of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) Unless a hearing is requested, a final determination under this paragraph (d) is final agency action and is not subject to further review.</P>
            <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart precludes the Grant Officer from issuing an initial determination and/or final determination directly to a subrecipient, in accordance with section 184(d)(3) of the Act. In such a case, the Grant Officer will inform the recipient of this action.</P>

            <P>(a) A recipient may request a waiver of liability, as described in WIA section 184(d)(2), and a Grant Officer may approve such a waiver under WIA section 184(d)(3).</P>
            <P>(b)(1) When the debt for which a waiver of liability is desired was established in a non-Federal resolution proceeding, the resolution report must accompany the waiver request.</P>
            <P>(2) When the waiver request is made during the ETA Grant Officer resolution process, the request must be made during the informal resolution period described in § 667.510(c).</P>
            <P>(c) A waiver of the recipient's liability shall be considered by the Grant Officer only when:</P>

            </P>
            <P>(4) The recipient has issued a final determination which disallows the misexpenditure, the recipient's appeal process has been exhausted, and a debt has been established; and</P>
            <P>(5) The recipient requests such a waiver and provides documentation to demonstrate that it has substantially complied with the requirements of section 184(d)(2) of the Act, and this section.</P>
            <P>(d) The recipient will not be released from liability for misspent funds under the determination required by section 184(d) of the Act unless the Grant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the recipient or subrecipients, would be inappropriate or would prove futile.</P>

            <P>(a) The recipient may request advance approval from the Grant Officer for contemplated corrective actions, including debt collection actions, which the recipient plans to initiate or to forego. The recipient's request must include a description and an assessment of all actions taken by the subrecipients to collect the misspent funds.</P>
            <P>(b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may determine that the recipient may forego certain collection actions against a subrecipient when:</P>
            <P>(1) The subrecipient meets the criteria set forth in section 184(d)(2) of the Act;</P>
            <P>(2) The misexpenditure of funds:</P>
            <P>(i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that received WIA funds from that subrecipient;</P>

            <P>(4) Final action within the recipient's appeal system has been completed; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>What procedure must be used for administering the offset/deduction provisions at section 184(c) of the Act?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) For recipient level misexpenditures, we may determine that a debt, or a portion thereof, may be offset against amounts that are allotted to the recipient. Recipients must submit a written request for an offset to the Grant Officer. Generally, we will apply the offset against amounts that are available at the recipient level for administrative costs.</P>
            <P>(2) The Grant Officer may approve an offset request, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the misexpenditures were not due to willful disregard of the requirements of the Act and regulations, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or a pattern of misexpenditure.</P>
            <P>(b) For subrecipient level misexpenditures that were not due to willful disregard of the requirements of the Act and regulations, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration or a pattern of misexpenditure, if we have required the State to repay such amount the State may deduct an amount equal to the misexpenditure from its subsequent year's allocations to the local area from funds available for the administrative costs of the local programs involved.</P>
            <P>(c) If offset is granted, the debt will not be fully satisfied until the Grant Officer reduces amounts allotted to the State by the amount of the misexpenditure.</P>

            <P>(d) A State may not make a deduction under paragraph (b) of this section until the State has taken appropriate corrective action to ensure full compliance within the local area with regard <PRTPAGE P="115"/>to appropriate expenditure of WIA funds.</P>

However, a request for hearing under this subpart is not considered a complaint to which the filing of an answer by DOL or a DOL agency or official is required.

            <P>(a) An applicant whose application for funding as a WIA INA grantee under 20 CFR part 668 or as an NFJP grantee under 20 CFR part 669 is denied in whole or in part may request an administrative review under § 667.800(a) with to determine whether there is a basis in the record to support the decision. This appeal will not in any way interfere with the designation and funding of another organization to serve the area in question during the appeal period. The available remedy in such an appeal is the right to be designated in the future as the WIA INA or NFJP grantee for the remainder of the current grant cycle. Neither retroactive nor immediately effective selection status may be awarded as relief in a non-selection appeal under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) If the ALJ rules that the organization should have been selected and the organization continues to meet the requirements of 20 CFR part 668 or part 669, we will select and fund the organization within 90 days of the ALJ's decision unless the end of the 90-day period is within six (6) months of the end of the funding period. An applicant so selected is not entitled to the full grant amount, but will only receive the funds remaining in the grant that have not been expended by the current grantee through its operation of the grant and its subsequent closeout.</P>
            <P>(c) Any organization selected and/or funded as a WIA INA or NFJP grantee is subject to being removed as grantee in the event an ALJ decision so orders. The Grant Officer provides instructions on transition and close-out to a grantee which is removed. All parties must agree to the provisions of this paragraph as a condition for WIA INA or NFJP funding.</P>
            <P>(d) A successful appellant which has not been awarded relief because of the application of paragraph (b) of this section is eligible to compete for funds in the immediately subsequent two-year grant cycle. In such a situation, we will not issue a waiver of competition and for the area and will select a grantee through the normal competitive process.</P>

            <P>(b) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 20 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 2-96), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law or policy to which exception is taken.

            <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of the programs established to serve Native American peoples (INA programs) under section 166 of the Workforce Investment Act?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The purpose of WIA INA programs is to support comprehensive employment and training activities for Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian individuals in order to:</P>
            <P>(1) Develop more fully their academic, occupational, and literacy skills;</P>
            <P>(2) Make them more competitive in the workforce;</P>
            <P>(3) Promote the economic and social development of Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities according to the goals and values of such communities; and</P>
            <P>(4) Help them achieve personal and economic self-sufficiency.</P>
            <P>(b) The principal means of accomplishing these purposes is to enable tribes and Native American organizations to provide employment and training services to Native American peoples and their communities. Services should be provided in a culturally appropriate manner, consistent with the principles of Indian self-determination. (WIA sec. 166(a)(1).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>How must INA programs be administered?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) We will administer INA programs to maximize the Federal commitment to support the growth and development of Native American people and communities as determined by representatives of such communities.</P>
            <P>(b) In administering these programs, we will observe the Congressional declaration of policy set forth in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, at 25 U.S.C. section 450a, as well as the Department of Labor's “American Indian and Alaska Native Policy,” dated July 29, 1998.</P>
            <P>(c) The regulations in this part are not intended to abrogate the trust responsibilities of the Federal Government to Native American bands, tribes, or groups in any way.</P>
            <P>(d) We will administer INA programs through a single organizational unit and consistent with the requirements in section 166(h) of the Act. We have designated the Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) as this single organizational unit required by WIA section 166(h)(1).</P>
            <P>(e) We will establish and maintain administrative procedures for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of Native American employment and training programs authorized under this Act. We will utilize staff who have a particular competence in this field to administer these programs. (WIA sec. 166(h).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>What obligation do we have to consult with the INA grantee community in developing rules, regulations, and standards of accountability for INA programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>We will consult with the Native American grantee community as a full partner in developing policies for the INA programs. We will actively seek and consider the views of all INA grantees, and will discuss options with the grantee community prior to establishing policies and program regulations. The primary consultation vehicle is the Native American Employment and Training Council. (WIA sec. 166(h)(2).)</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for designation as an “Indian or Native American (INA) grantee”?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be designated as an INA grantee, an entity must have:</P>
            <P>(1) A legal status as a government or as an agency of a government, private non-profit corporation, or a consortium which contains at least one of these entities;</P>
            <P>(2) The ability to administer INA program funds, as defined at § 668.220; and</P>
            <P>(3) A new (non-incumbent) entity must have a population within the designated geographic service area which would provide funding under the funding formula found at § 668.296(b) in the amount of at least $100,000, including any amounts received for supplemental youth services under the funding formula at § 668.440(a). Incumbent grantees which do not meet this dollar threshold for Program Year (PY) 2000 and beyond will be grandfathered in. We will make an exception for grantees wishing to participate in the demonstration program under Public Law 102-477 if all resources to be consolidated under the Public Law 102-477 plan total at least $100,000, with at least $20,000 derived from section 166 funds as determined by the most recent Census data. Exceptions to this $20,000 limit may be made for those entities which are close to the limit and which have demonstrated the capacity to administer Federal funds and operate a successful employment and training program.</P>
            <P>(b) To be designated as a Native American grantee, a consortium or its members must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be in close proximity to one another, but they may operate in more than one State;</P>
            <P>(2) Have an administrative unit legally authorized to run the program and to commit the other members to contracts, grants, and other legally-binding agreements; and</P>
            <P>(3) Be jointly and individually responsible for the actions and obligations of the consortium, including debts.</P>
            <P>(c) Entities potentially eligible for designation under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section are:</P>
            <P>(1) Federally-recognized Indian tribes;</P>
            <P>(2) Tribal organizations, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 450b;</P>

            <P>(3) Alaska Native-controlled organizations representing regional or village areas, as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act;<PRTPAGE P="121"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) Native Hawaiian-controlled entities;</P>
            <P>(5) Native American-controlled organizations serving Indians; and</P>
            <P>(6) Consortia of eligible entities which individually meets the legal requirements for a consortium described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) Under WIA section 166(d)(2)(B), individuals who were eligible to participate under section 401 of JTPA on August 6, 1998, remain eligible to participate under section 166 of WIA. State-recognized tribal organizations serving such individuals are considered to be “Native American controlled” for WIA section 166 purposes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What priority for designation is given to eligible organizations?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Federally-recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native entities, or consortia that include a tribe or entity will have the highest priority for designation. To be designated, the organizations must meet the requirements in this subpart. These organizations will be designated for those geographic areas and/or populations over which they have legal jurisdiction. (WIA sec. 166(c)(1).)</P>
            <P>(b) If we decide not to designate Indian tribes or Alaska Native entities to serve their service areas, we will enter into arrangements to provide services with entities which the tribes or Alaska Native entities involved approve.</P>
            <P>(c) In geographic areas not served by Indian tribes or Alaska Native entities, entities with a Native American-controlled governing body and which are representative of the Native American community or communities involved will have priority for designation.</P>

            <P>An organization has the “ability to administer funds” if it:</P>
            <P>(a) Is in compliance with Departmental debt management procedures, if applicable;</P>
            <P>(b) Has not been found guilty of fraud or criminal activity which would affect the entity's ability to safeguard Federal funds or deliver program services;</P>
            <P>(c) Can demonstrate that it has or can acquire the necessary program and financial management personnel to safeguard Federal funds and effectively deliver program services; and</P>
            <P>(d) Can demonstrate that it has successfully carried out, or has the capacity to successfully carry out activities that will strengthen the ability of the individuals served to obtain or retain unsubsidized employment.</P>

            <P>(a) Before determining which entity to designate for a particular service area, we will conduct a review of the entity's ability to administer funds.</P>
            <P>(b) The review for an entity that has served as a grantee in either of the two designation periods before the one under consideration, also will consider the extent of compliance with the WIA regulations. Evidence of the ability to administer funds may be established by a satisfactory Federal audit record. It may also be established by a recent record showing substantial compliance with Federal record keeping, reporting, program performance standards, or similar standards imposed on grantees by this or other public sector supported programs.</P>
            <P>(c) For other entities, the review includes the experience of the entity's management in administering funds for services to Native American people. This review also includes an assessment of the relationship between the entity and the Native American community or communities to be served.</P>

            <P>(a) Every entity seeking designation must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) which complies with the requirements of the Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA). An SGA will be issued every two years, covering all areas except for those for which competition is waived for the incumbent grantee under WIA section 166(c)(2).</P>

For NOI's received after October 1, only a timely official U.S. Postal Service postmark is acceptable as proof of timely submission. Dates indicating submission by private express delivery services or metered mail are unacceptable as proof of the timely submission of designation documents.</P>
            <P>(c) NOI's must include the following:</P>

            <P>(b) If two or more entities apply for grants for the same service area, or for overlapping service areas, and a waiver of competition under WIA section 166(c)(2) is not granted to the incumbent grantee, the following additional procedures apply:</P>
            <P>(1) The Grant Officer will follow the regulations for priority designation at § 668.210.</P>
            <P>(2) If no applicant is entitled to priority designation, DINAP will inform each entity which submitted a NOI, including the incumbent grantee, in writing, of all the competing Notices of Intent no later than November 15 of the year the NOI's are received.</P>
            <P>(3) Each entity will have an opportunity to describe its service plan, and may submit additional information addressing the requirements of § 668.240(c) or such other information as the applicant determines is appropriate. Revised Notices must be received or contain an official U.S. Postal Service postmark, no later than January 5th (unless a later date is provided in DINAP's information notice).</P>

            <P>Yes, for an area which would otherwise go unserved. The Grant Officer may designate an entity, which has not submitted an NOI, but which meets the qualifications for designation, to serve the particular geographic area. Under such circumstances, DINAP will seek the views of Native American leaders in the area involved about the decision to designate the entity to serve that community. DINAP will inform the Grant Officer of their views. The Grant Officer will accommodate their views to the extent possible.</P>

            <P>No, beginning with the PY 2000 grant awards, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for designation in a particular area, or willing to serve that area, we will not allocate funds for that service area. The funds allocated to that area will be distributed to the remaining INA grantees, or used for other program purposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). Unawarded funds used for technical assistance and training are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 668.296(e). Areas which are unserved by the INA program may be restored during a subsequent designation cycle, when and if a current grantee or other eligible entity applies for and is designated to serve that area.</P>

            <P>(a) Except for reserved funds described in paragraph (e) of this section and funds used for program purposes under § 668.294, all funds available for WIA section 166(d)(2)(A)(i) comprehensive workforce investment services program at the beginning of a Program Year will be allocated to Native American grantees for their designated geographic service areas.</P>
            <P>(b) Each INA grantee will receive the sum of the funds calculated under the following formula:</P>
            <P>(1) One-quarter of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of unemployed Native American persons in the grantee's designated INA service area(s) compared to all such persons in all such areas in the United States.</P>

            <P>(2) Three-quarters of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of Native American persons in poverty in the grantee's designated INA service area(s) as compared to all such persons in all such areas in the United States.<PRTPAGE P="124"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The data and definitions used to implement these formulas is provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</P>
            <P>(c) In years immediately following the use of new data in the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section, based upon criteria to be described in the SGA, we may utilize a hold harmless factor to reduce the disruption in grantee services which would otherwise result from changes in funding levels. This factor will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.</P>
            <P>(d) We may reallocate funds from one INA grantee to another if a grantee is unable to serve its area for any reason, such as audit or debt problems, criminal activity, internal (political) strife, or lack of ability or interest. Funds may also be reallocated if a grantee has carry-in excess of 20 percent of the total funds available to it. Carry-in amounts greater than 20 percent but less than 25 percent of total funds available may be allowed under an approved waiver issued by DINAP.</P>
            <P>(e) We may reserve up to one percent (1 percent) of the funds appropriated under WIA section 166(d)(2)(A)(i) for any Program Year for TAT purposes. Technical assistance will be provided in consultation with the Native American Employment and Training Council.</P>

We reserve the right to redetermine this youth funding stream in future program years, in consultation with the Native American Employment and Training Council, as program experience warrants and as appropriate data become available.</P>
            <P>(b) The data used to implement this formula is provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</P>
            <P>(c) The hold harmless factor described in § 668.296(c) also applies to supplemental youth services funding. This factor also will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.</P>
            <P>(d) The reallocation provisions of § 668.296(d) also apply to supplemental youth services funding.</P>
            <P>(e) Any supplemental youth services funds not allotted to a grantee or refused by a grantee may be used for the purposes outlined in § 668.296(e), as described in § 668.294. Any such funds are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 668.296(e).</P>

            <SUBJECT>How is this accountability documented and fulfilled?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each INA grantee must establish its own internal policies and procedures to ensure accountability to the INA grantee's governing body, as the representative of the Native American community(ies) served by the INA program. At a minimum, these policies and procedures must provide a system for governing body review and oversight of program plans and measures and standards for program performance.</P>
            <P>(b) Accountability to the Department is accomplished in part through on-site program reviews (monitoring), which strengthen the INA grantee's capability to deliver effective services and protect the integrity of Federal funds.</P>
            <P>(c) In addition to audit information, as described at § 668.850 and program reviews, accountability to the Department is documented and fulfilled by the submission of reports. For the purposes of report submission, a postmark or date indicating receipt by a private express delivery service is acceptable proof of timely submission. These report requirements are as follows:</P>

            <P>(1) Each INA grantee must submit an annual report on program participants and activities. This report must be received no later than 90 days after the end of the Program Year, and may be combined with the report on program expenditures. The reporting format is developed by DINAP, in consultation with the Native American Advisory Council, and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Each INA grantee must submit an annual report on program expenditures. This report must be received no later than 90 days after the end of the Program Year, and may be combined with the report on program participants and activities.</P>
            <P>(3) INA grantees are encouraged, but not required, to submit a descriptive narrative with their annual reports describing the barriers to successful plan implementation they have encountered. This narrative should also discuss program successes and other notable occurrences that effected the INA grantee's overall performance that year.</P>
            <P>(4) Each INA grantee may be required to submit interim reports on program participants and activities and/or program expenditures during the Program Year. Interim reports must be received no later than 45 days after the end of the reporting period.</P>

            <P>(b) Each INA grantee must have rules to prevent conflict of interest by its governing body. These conflict of interest rules must include a rule prohibiting any member of any governing body or council associated with the INA grantee from voting on any matter which would provide a direct financial benefit to that member, or to a member of his or her immediate family, in accordance with 20 CFR 667.200(a)(4) and 29 CFR 97.36(b) or 29 CFR 95.42.</P>

            <P>(c) Officers or agents of the INA grantee must not solicit or personally accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from any actual or <PRTPAGE P="131"/>potential contractor, subgrantee, vendor or participant. This rule must also apply to officers or agents of the grantee's contractors and/or subgrantees. This prohibition does not apply to:</P>
            <P>(1) Any rebate, discount or similar incentive provided by a vendor to its customers as a regular feature of its business;</P>
            <P>(2) Items of nominal monetary value distributed consistent with the cultural practices of the Native American community served by the grantee.</P>
            <P>(d) No person who selects program participants or authorizes the services provided to them may select or authorize services to any participant who is such a person's husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, son, or daughter unless:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) The participant involved is a low income individual; or</P>

            <P>(e) INA grantees are subject to the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 53 relating to kickbacks.</P>
            <P>(f) No assistance provided under this Act may involve political activities. (WIA sec. 195(6).)</P>
            <P>(g) INA grantees may not use funds under this Act for lobbying, as provided in 29 CFR part 93.</P>
            <P>(h) The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 665 and 666 prohibiting embezzlement apply to programs under WIA.</P>
            <P>(i) Recipients of financial assistance under WIA section 168 are prohibited from discriminatory practices as outlined at WIA section 188, and the regulations implementing WIA section 188, at 29 CFR part 37. However, this does not affect the legal requirement that all INA participants be Native American.

            <P>(a) In those local workforce investment areas where the grantee operates its NFJP, the grantee is a required partner of the local One-Stop delivery system and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in 20 CFR part 662. Consistent with those provisions, the grantee and the Local Board must negotiate an MOU which meets the requirements of 20 CFR 662.300 and sets forth their respective responsibilities for making the full range of services available through the One-Stop system available to farmworkers. Where the Local Board is an alternative entity under 20 CFR 661.330, the NFJP grantee must negotiate with the Board on the terms of its MOU and the scope of its on-going role in the local workforce investment system, as specified in 20 CFR 661.310(b)(2). In local areas where the grantee does not operate its NFJP and there is a large concentration of MSFW's, the grantee may consider the availability of electronic connections and other means to participate in the One-stop system in that area, in order to serve those individuals.</P>
            <P>(b) The MOU must provide for appropriate and equitable services to MSFW's, and may include costs of services to MSFW's incurred by the One-Stop that extend beyond Wagner-Peyser funded services and activities.</P>

            <SUBJECT>If a student is injured in the performance of duty as a Job Corps Student, what benefits may they receive?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Job Corps students are considered Federal employees for purposes of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) as specified in 29 U.S.C. 2897.</P>
            <P>(b) Job Corps students may be entitled to benefits under FECA as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8143 for injuries occurring in the performance of duty.</P>

            <P>(c) Job Corps students must meet the same eligibility tests for FECA benefits that apply to all other Federal employees. The requirements for FECA benefits may be found at 5 U.S.C. 8101, <E T="03">et seq.</E> and part 10 of this title. The Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the FECA program; all FECA determinations are within the exclusive authority of the OWCP, subject to appeal to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board.</P>

            <P>(d) Whenever a student is injured, develops an occupationally related illness, or dies while in the performance of duty, the procedures of the OWCP, at part 10 of this title, must be followed. To assist OWCP in determining FECA eligibility, a thorough investigation of the circumstances and a medical evaluation must be completed and required forms must be timely filed by the center operator with the DOL's OWCP. Additional information regarding Job Corps FECA claims may be found in OWCP's regulations and procedures available on DOL's Web site located at <E T="03">www.dol.gov.</E>

          <SECTNO>§ 671.130</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>When should applications for national emergency grants be submitted to the Department?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Applications for national emergency grants to respond to mass layoffs and plant closures may be submitted to the Department as soon as:</P>
          <P>(1) The State receives a notification of a mass layoff or a closure as a result of a WARN notice, a general announcement or some other means determined by the Governor to be sufficient to respond;</P>
          <P>(2) Rapid response assistance has been initiated; and</P>
          <P>(3) A determination has been made, in collaboration with the applicable Local Board(s) and chief elected official(s), that State and local formula dislocated worker funds are inadequate to provide the level of services needed by the workers being laid off.</P>
          <P>(b) An eligible entity may apply for a national emergency grant at any time during the year.</P>
          <P>(c) Applications for national emergency grants to respond to a declared emergency or natural disaster as described in § 671.110(e), cannot be considered until FEMA has declared that the affected area is eligible for disaster-related public assistance.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 671.140</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>What are the allowable activities and what dislocated workers may be served under national emergency grants?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) National emergency grants may provide adjustment assistance for eligible dislocated workers, described at WIA section 173(c)(2) or (d)(2).</P>
          <P>(b) Adjustment assistance includes the core, intensive, and training services authorized at WIA sections 134(d) and 173. The scope of services to be provided in a particular project are negotiated between the Department and the grantee, taking into account the needs of the target population covered by the grant. The scope of services may be changed through grant modifications, if necessary.</P>
          <P>(c) National emergency grants may provide for supportive services to help workers who require such assistance to participate in activities provided for in the grant. Needs-related payments, in support of other employment and training assistance, may be available for the purpose of enabling dislocated workers who are eligible for such payments to participate in programs of training services. Generally, the terms of a grant must be consistent with Local Board policies governing such financial assistance with formula funds (including the payment levels and duration of payments). However, the terms of the grant agreement may diverge from established Local Board policies, in the following instances:</P>
          <P>(1) If unemployed dislocated workers served by the project are not able to meet the 13 or 8 weeks enrollment in training requirement at WIA section 134(e)(3)(B) because of the lack of formula or emergency grant funds in the State or local area at the time of dislocation, such individuals may be eligible for needs-related payments if they are enrolled in training by the end of the 6th week following the date of the emergency grant award;</P>
          <P>(2) Trade-impacted workers who are not eligible for trade readjustment assistance under NAFTA-TAA may be eligible for needs-related payments under a national emergency grant if the worker is enrolled in training by the end of the 16th week following layoff; and</P>
          <P>(3) Under other circumstances as specified in the national emergency grant application guidelines.</P>
          <P>(d) A national emergency grant to respond to a declared emergency or natural disaster, as defined at § 671.110(e), may provide short-term disaster relief employment for:</P>
          <P>(1) Individuals who are temporarily or permanently laid off as a consequence of the disaster;</P>
          <P>(2) Dislocated workers; and</P>
          <P>(3) Long-term unemployed individuals.</P>

          <P>(e) Temporary employment assistance is authorized on disaster projects that provide food, clothing, shelter and <PRTPAGE P="163"/>other humanitarian assistance for disaster victims; and on projects that perform demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation and reconstruction of damaged and destroyed structures, facilities and lands located within the disaster area. For such temporary jobs, each eligible worker is limited to no more than six months of employment for each single disaster. The amounts, duration and other limitations on wages will be negotiated for each grant.</P>
          <P>(f) Additional requirements that apply to national emergency grants, including natural disaster grants, are contained in the application instructions.</P>

          <P>(a) State and Local Board grantees may request and we may approve the application of existing general statutory or regulatory waivers and workflex waivers to a National Emergency Grant award. The application for grant funds must describe any statutory waivers which the applicant wishes to apply to the project that the State and/or Local Board, as applicable, have been granted under its waiver plan, or that the State has approved for implementation in the applicable local area under workflex waivers. We will consider such requests as part of the overall application review and decision process.</P>
          <P>(b) If, during the operation of the project, the grantee wishes to apply a waiver not identified in the application, the grantee must request a modification which includes the provision to be waived, the operational barrier to be removed and the effect upon the outcome of the project.</P>

          <P>(a) Rapid response is a required Statewide activity under WIA section 134(a)(2)(A), to be carried out by the State or its designee in collaboration with the Local Board(s) and chief elected official(s).

          <P>(b) In accordance with national emergency grant application guidelines published by the Department, each applicant must demonstrate that:</P>
          <P>(1) The rapid response activities described in 20 CFR 665.310 have been initiated and carried out, or are in the process of being carried out;</P>
          <P>(2) State and local funds, including those made available under section 132(b)(2)(B) of the Act, have been used to initiate appropriate services to the eligible workers;</P>

          <P>(4) The application has been developed by or in conjunction with the Local Board(s) and chief elected official(s) of the local area(s) in which the proposed project is to operate.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 671.170</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>What are the program and administrative requirements that apply to national emergency grants?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In general, the program requirements and administrative standards set forth at 20 CFR parts 663 and 667 will apply.</P>
          <P>(b) Exceptions include:</P>
          <P>(1) Funds provided in response to a natural disaster may be used for temporary job creation in areas declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA, subject to the limitations of WIA section 173(d), this part and the application guidelines issued by the Department;</P>
          <P>(2) National emergency grant funds may be used to pay an appropriate level of administrative costs based on the design and complexity of the project. We will negotiate administration costs with the applicant as part of the application review and grant award and modification processes;</P>
          <P>(3) The period of availability for expenditure of funds under a national emergency grant is specified in the grant agreement.</P>

          <P>(4) We may establish supplemental reporting, monitoring and oversight requirements for national emergency <PRTPAGE P="164"/>grants. The requirements will be identified in the grant application instructions or the grant document.</P>
          <P>(5) We may negotiate and fund projects under terms other than those specified in this part where it can be clearly demonstrated that such adjustments will achieve a greater positive benefit for the workers and/or communities being assisted.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is YouthBuild?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) YouthBuild is a workforce development program that provides employment, education, leadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged and low-income youth between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom are secondary school drop outs and are either a member of a low-income family, a foster care youth, a youth offender, a youth with a disability, a child of an incarcerated parent, or a migrant youth.</P>

            <P>(b) Program participants receive education services that may lead to either <PRTPAGE P="165"/>a high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED). Further, they receive occupational skills training and are encouraged to pursue a post- secondary education or additional training, including registered apprenticeship programs. The program is designed to create a skilled workforce either in the construction industry, through the rehabilitation and construction of housing for homeless individuals and families and low- income families, as well as public facilities, or in other high wage, high-demand jobs. The program also benefits the larger community because it provides more new and rehabilitated affordable housing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the purposes of the YouthBuild program?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The overarching goal of the YouthBuild program is to provide disadvantaged and low-income youth the opportunity to obtain education and employment skills in local in-demand and high-demand jobs to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, the YouthBuild program has as goals:</P>
            <P>(1) To promote leadership skills development and community service activities. YouthBuild programs will foster the development of leadership skills and a commitment to community improvement among youth in low-income communities.</P>
            <P>(2) To enable youth to further their education and training. YouthBuild programs will provide counseling and assistance in obtaining post-secondary education and/or employment and training placements that allow youth to further their education and training.</P>
            <P>(3) To expand the supply of permanent affordable housing and reduce the rate of homelessness in communities with YouthBuild programs. The program seeks to increase the number of affordable housing units available and to decrease the number of homeless individuals and families in their communities.</P>
            <P>(b) Through these educational and occupational opportunities, to enable youth participants to provide a valuable contribution to their communities. The YouthBuild program will add skilled workers to the workforce by educating and training youth who might have otherwise succumbed to the negative influences within their environments.</P>

          <SUBJECT>What is the development, submission, and approval process of the Combined State Plan?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For purposes of § 676.140(a), if a State chooses to develop a Combined State Plan it must submit the Combined State Plan in accordance with the requirements described below and sec. 103 of WIOA, as explained in the joint planning guidelines issued by the Secretaries of Labor and Education.</P>
          <P>(b) The Combined State Plan must be developed with the assistance of the State WDB, as required by § 679.130(a) of this chapter and WIOA sec. 101(d), and must be developed in coordination with administrators with optimum policy-making authority for the core programs and required one-stop partners.</P>
          <P>(c) The State must provide an opportunity for public comment on and input into the development of the Combined State Plan prior to its submission.</P>
          <P>(1) The opportunity for public comment for the portions of the Combined State Plan that cover the core programs must include an opportunity for comment by representatives of Local WDBs and chief elected officials, businesses, representatives of labor organizations, community-based organizations, adult education providers, institutions of higher education, other stakeholders with an interest in the services provided by the six core programs, and the general public, including individuals with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(2) Consistent with the “Sunshine Provision” of WIOA in sec. 101(g), the State WDB must make information regarding the Combined State Plan available to the public through electronic means and regularly occurring open meetings in accordance with State law. The Combined State Plan must describe the State's process and timeline for ensuring a meaningful opportunity for public comment on the portions of the plan covering core programs.</P>
          <P>(3) The portions of the plan that cover the Combined State Plan partner programs are subject to any public comment requirements applicable to those programs.</P>

          <P>(d) The State must submit to the Secretaries of Labor and Education and <PRTPAGE P="186"/>to the Secretary of the agency with responsibility for approving the program's plan or deeming it complete under the law governing the program, as part of its Combined State Plan, any plan, application, form, or any other similar document that is required as a condition for the approval of Federal funding under the applicable program or activity. Such submission must occur in accordance with a process identified by the relevant Secretaries in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) The Combined State Plan will be approved or disapproved in accordance with the requirements of sec. 103(c) of WIOA.</P>
          <P>(1) The portion of the Combined State Plan covering programs administered by the Departments of Labor and Education must be reviewed, and approved or disapproved, by the appropriate Secretary within 90 days beginning on the day the Combined State Plan is received by the appropriate Secretary from the State, consistent with paragraph (f) of this section. Before the Secretaries of Labor and Education approve the Combined State Plan, the vocational rehabilitation services portion of the Combined State Plan described in WIOA sec. 102(b)(2)(D)(iii) must be approved by the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration.</P>
          <P>(2) If an appropriate Secretary other than the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Education has authority to approve or deem complete a portion of the Combined State Plan for a program or activity described in § 676.140(d), that portion of the Combined State Plan must be reviewed, and approved, disapproved, or deemed complete, by the appropriate Secretary within 120 days beginning on the day the Combined State Plan is received by the appropriate Secretary from the State consistent with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) The appropriate Secretaries will review and approve or deem complete the Combined State Plan within 90 or 120 days, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the Secretaries of Labor and Education or appropriate Secretary have determined in writing within that period that:</P>
          <P>(1) The Combined State Plan is inconsistent with the requirements of the six core programs or the Federal laws authorizing or applicable to the program or activity involved, including the criteria for approval of a plan or application, or deeming the plan complete, if any, under such law;</P>
          <P>(2) The portion of the Combined State Plan describing the six core programs or the program or activity described in paragraph (a) of this section involved does not satisfy the criteria as provided in sec. 102 or 103 of WIOA, as applicable; or</P>
          <P>(3) The Combined State Plan is incomplete, or otherwise insufficient to determine whether it is consistent with a core program's requirements, other requirements of WIOA, or the Federal laws authorizing, or applicable to, the program or activity described in § 676.140(d), including the criteria for approval of a plan or application, if any, under such law.</P>
          <P>(g) If the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, or the appropriate Secretary does not make the written determination described in paragraph (f) of this section within the relevant period of time after submission of the Combined State Plan, that portion of the Combined State Plan over which the Secretary has jurisdiction will be considered approved.</P>
          <P>(h) The Secretaries of Labor and Education's written determination of approval or disapproval regarding the portion of the plan for the six core programs may be separate from the written determination of approval, disapproval, or completeness of the program-specific requirements of Combined State Plan partner programs and activities described in § 676.140(d) and included in the Combined State Plan.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Special rule.</E> In paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section, the term “criteria for approval of a plan or application,” with respect to a State or a core program or a program under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), includes a requirement for agreement between the State and the appropriate Secretaries regarding State performance measures or State performance accountability measures, as the <PRTPAGE P="187"/>case may be, including levels of performance.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 676.145</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for modifications of the Combined State Plan?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For the core program portions of the Combined State Plan, modifications are required, at a minimum:</P>
          <P>(1) By the end of the first 2-year period of any 4-year State Plan. The State WDB must review the Combined State Plan, and the Governor must submit modifications to the Combined State Plan to reflect changes in labor market and economic conditions or other factors affecting the implementation of the Combined State Plan;</P>
          <P>(2) When changes in Federal or State law or policy substantially affect the strategies, goals, and priorities upon which the Combined State Plan is based;</P>
          <P>(3) When there are changes in the statewide vision, strategies, policies, State negotiated levels of performance as described in § 677.170(b) of this chapter, the methodology used to determine local allocation of funds, reorganizations that change the working relationship with system employees, changes in organizational responsibilities, changes to the membership structure of the State WDB or alternative entity, and similar substantial changes to the State's workforce development system.</P>
          <P>(b) In addition to the required modification review described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a State may submit a modification of its Combined State Plan at any time during the 4-year period of the plan.</P>
          <P>(c) For any Combined State Plan partner programs and activities described in § 676.140(d) that are included in a State's Combined State Plan, the State—</P>
          <P>(1) May decide if the modification requirements under WIOA sec. 102(c)(3) that apply to the core programs will apply to the Combined State Plan partner programs, as long as consistent with any other modification requirements for the programs, or may comply with the requirements applicable to only the particular program or activity; and</P>
          <P>(2) Must submit, in accordance with the procedure described in § 676.143, any modification, amendment, or revision required by the Federal law authorizing, or applicable to, the Combined State Plan partner program or activity.</P>
          <P>(i) If the underlying programmatic requirements change (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the authorizing statute is reauthorized) for Federal laws authorizing such programs, a State must either modify its Combined State Plan or submit a separate plan to the appropriate Federal agency in accordance with the new Federal law authorizing the Combined State Plan partner program or activity and other legal requirements applicable to such program or activity.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the modification, amendment, or revision affects the administration of only that particular Combined State Plan partner program and has no impact on the Combined State Plan as a whole or the integration and administration of the core and other Combined State Plan partner programs at the State level, modifications must be submitted for approval to only the appropriate Secretary, based on the approval standards applicable to the original Combined State Plan under § 676.143, if the State elects, or in accordance with the procedures and requirements applicable to the particular Combined State Plan partner program.</P>
          <P>(3) A State also may amend its Combined State Plan to add a Combined State Plan partner program or activity described in § 676.140(d).</P>

          <P>(d) Modifications of the Combined State Plan are subject to the same public review and comment requirements that apply to the development of the original Combined State Plan as described in § 676.143(c) except that, if the modification, amendment, or revision affects the administration of a particular Combined State Plan partner program and has no impact on the Combined State Plan as a whole or the integration and administration of the core and other Combined State Plan partner programs at the State level, a State may comply instead with the procedures and requirements applicable to the particular Combined State Plan partner program.<PRTPAGE P="188"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) Modifications for the core program portions of the Combined State Plan must be approved by the Secretaries of Labor and Education, based on the approval standards applicable to the original Combined State Plan under § 676.143. This approval must come after the approval of the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration for modification of any portion of the Combined State Plan described in sec. 102(b)(2)(D)(iii) of WIOA.</P>

          <P>(2) For the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) title I youth program, a participant is a reportable individual who has satisfied all applicable program requirements for the provision of services, including eligibility determination, an objective assessment, and development of an individual service strategy, and received 1 of the 14 WIOA youth program elements identified in sec. 129(c)(2) of WIOA.</P>
          <P>(3) The following individuals are not participants:</P>
          <P>(i) Individuals in an Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program who have not completed at least 12 contact hours;</P>
          <P>(ii) Individuals who only use the self-service system.</P>
          <P>(A) Subject to paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, self-service occurs when individuals independently access any workforce development system program's information and activities in either a physical location, such as a one-stop center resource room or partner agency, or remotely via the use of electronic technologies.</P>
          <P>(B) Self-service does not uniformly apply to all virtually accessed services. For example, virtually accessed services that provide a level of support beyond independent job or information seeking on the part of an individual would not qualify as self-service.</P>
          <P>(iii) Individuals who receive information-only services or activities, which provide readily available information that does not require an assessment by a staff member of the individual's skills, education, or career objectives.</P>
          <P>(4) Programs must include participants in their performance calculations.</P>

          <P>(3) Individuals who only receive information-only services or activities.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Exit.</E> As defined for the purpose of performance calculations, exit is the point after which a participant who has received services through any program meets the following criteria:</P>
          <P>(1) For the adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs authorized under WIOA title I, the AEFLA program authorized under WIOA title II, and the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III, exit date is the last date of service.</P>
          <P>(i) The last day of service cannot be determined until at least 90 days have elapsed since the participant last received services; services do not include self-service, information-only services or activities, or follow-up services. This also requires that there are no plans to provide the participant with future services.</P>

            <P>(b) States must reach agreement on levels of performance with the Secretaries of Labor and Education for each indicator for each core program. These are the negotiated levels of performance. The negotiated levels must be based on the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) How the negotiated levels of performance compare with State levels of performance established for other States;</P>
            <P>(2) The application of an objective statistical model established by the Secretaries of Labor and Education, subject to paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) How the negotiated levels promote continuous improvement in performance based on the primary indicators and ensure optimal return on investment of Federal funds; and</P>
            <P>(4) The extent to which the negotiated levels assist the State in meeting the performance goals established by the Secretaries of Labor and Education for the core programs in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, as amended.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When are sanctions applied for a State's failure to submit an annual performance report?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Sanctions will be applied when a State fails to submit the State annual performance report required under sec. 116(d)(2) of WIOA. A State fails to report if the State either:</P>
            <P>(1) Does not submit a State annual performance report by the date for timely submission set in performance reporting guidance; or</P>
            <P>(2) Submits a State annual performance report by the date for timely submission, but the report is incomplete.</P>
            <P>(b) Sanctions will not be applied if the reporting failure is due to exceptional circumstances outside of the State's control. Exceptional circumstances may include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Natural disasters;</P>
            <P>(2) Unexpected personnel transitions; and</P>
            <P>(3) Unexpected technology related issues.</P>
            <P>(c) In the event that a State may not be able to submit a complete and accurate performance report by the deadline for timely reporting:</P>
            <P>(1) The State must notify the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days prior to the established deadline for submission, of a potential impact on the State's ability to submit its State annual performance report in order to not be considered failing to report.</P>
            <P>(2) In circumstances where unexpected events occur less than 30 days before the established deadline for submission of the State annual performance reports, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will review requests for extending the reporting deadline in accordance with the Departments of Labor and Education's procedures that will be established in guidance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When are sanctions applied for failure to achieve adjusted levels of performance?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) States' negotiated levels of performance will be adjusted through the application of the statistical adjustment model established under § 677.170 to account for actual economic conditions experienced during a program <PRTPAGE P="195"/>year and characteristics of participants, annually at the close of each program year.</P>
            <P>(b) Any State that fails to meet adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance outlined in § 677.155 for any year will receive technical assistance, including assistance in the development of a performance improvement plan provided by the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Education.</P>
            <P>(c) Whether a State has failed to meet adjusted levels of performance will be determined using the following three criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) The overall State program score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by a core program on the primary indicators of performance to the adjusted levels of performance for that core program. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators by a core program will constitute the overall State program score.</P>
            <P>(2) However, until all indicators for the core program have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State program score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data for that program;</P>
            <P>(3) The overall State indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved on a primary indicator of performance by all core programs in a State to the adjusted levels of performance for that primary indicator. The average of the percentages achieved of the adjusted level of performance by all of the core programs on that indicator will constitute the overall State indicator score.</P>
            <P>(4) However, until all indicators for the State have at least 2 years of complete data, the overall State indicator score will be based on a comparison of the actual results achieved to the adjusted level of performance for each of the primary indicators that have at least 2 years of complete data in a State.</P>
            <P>(5) The individual indicator score, which is expressed as the percent achieved, compares the actual results achieved by each core program on each of the individual primary indicators to the adjusted levels of performance for each of the program's primary indicators of performance.</P>
            <P>(d) A performance failure occurs when:</P>
            <P>(1) Any overall State program score or overall State indicator score falls below 90 percent for the program year; or</P>
            <P>(2) Any of the States' individual indicator scores fall below 50 percent for the program year.</P>
            <P>(e) Sanctions based on performance failure will be applied to States if, for 2 consecutive years, the State fails to meet:</P>
            <P>(1) 90 percent of the overall State program score for the same core program;</P>
            <P>(2) 90 percent of the overall State indicator score for the same primary indicator; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>What should States expect when a sanction is applied to the Governor's Reserve Allotment?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by five percent of the maximum available amount for the immediately succeeding program year if:</P>
            <P>(1) The State fails to submit the State annual performance reports as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(2), as defined in § 677.185;</P>
            <P>(2) The State fails to meet State adjusted levels of performance for the same primary performance indicator(s) under either § 677.190(d)(1) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 677.190; or</P>
            <P>(3) The State's score on the same indicator for the same program falls below 50 percent under § 677.190(d)(2) for the second consecutive year as defined in § 677.190.</P>

            <P>(b) If the State fails under paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (3) of this section in the same program year, the Secretaries of Labor and Education will reduce the Governor's Reserve Allotment by 10 percent of the maximum <PRTPAGE P="196"/>available amount for the immediately succeeding program year.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 678.300</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the one-stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The one-stop delivery system brings together workforce development, educational, and other human resource services in a seamless customer-focused service delivery network that enhances access to the programs' services and improves long-term employment outcomes for individuals receiving assistance. One-stop partners administer separately funded programs as a set of integrated streamlined services to customers.</P>
            <P>(b) Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) assigns responsibilities at the local, State, and Federal level to ensure the creation and maintenance of a one-stop delivery system that enhances the range and quality of education and workforce development services that employers and individual customers can access.</P>
            <P>(c) The system must include at least one comprehensive physical center in each local area as described in § 678.305.</P>
            <P>(d) The system may also have additional arrangements to supplement the comprehensive center. These arrangements include:</P>
            <P>(1) An affiliated site or a network of affiliated sites, where one or more partners make programs, services, and activities available, as described in § 678.310;</P>
            <P>(2) A network of eligible one-stop partners, as described in §§ 678.400 through 678.410, through which each partner provides one or more of the programs, services, and activities that are linked, physically or technologically, to an affiliated site or access point that assures customers are provided information on the availability of career services, as well as other program services and activities, regardless of where they initially enter the public workforce system in the local area; and</P>
            <P>(3) Specialized centers that address specific needs, including those of dislocated workers, youth, or key industry sectors, or clusters.</P>

            <P>(e) Required one-stop partner programs must provide access to programs, services, and activities through <PRTPAGE P="202"/>electronic means if applicable and practicable. This is in addition to providing access to services through the mandatory comprehensive physical one-stop center and any affiliated sites or specialized centers. The provision of programs and services by electronic methods such as Web sites, telephones, or other means must improve the efficiency, coordination, and quality of one-stop partner services. Electronic delivery must not replace access to such services at a comprehensive one-stop center or be a substitute to making services available at an affiliated site if the partner is participating in an affiliated site. Electronic delivery systems must be in compliance with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIOA sec. 188 and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 38.</P>
            <P>(f) The design of the local area's one-stop delivery system must be described in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed with the one-stop partners, described in § 678.500.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 678.305</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is a comprehensive one-stop center and what must be provided there?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A comprehensive one-stop center is a physical location where job seeker and employer customers can access the programs, services, and activities of all required one-stop partners. A comprehensive one-stop center must have at least one title I staff person physically present.</P>
            <P>(b) The comprehensive one-stop center must provide:</P>
            <P>(1) Career services, described in § 678.430;</P>
            <P>(2) Access to training services described in § 680.200 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(3) Access to any employment and training activities carried out under sec. 134(d) of WIOA;</P>
            <P>(4) Access to programs and activities carried out by one-stop partners listed in §§ 678.400 through 678.410, including the Employment Service program authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by WIOA title III (Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service program); and</P>
            <P>(5) Workforce and labor market information.</P>
            <P>(c) Customers must have access to these programs, services, and activities during regular business days at a comprehensive one-stop center. The Local Workforce Development Board (WDB) may establish other service hours at other times to accommodate the schedules of individuals who work on regular business days. The State WDB will evaluate the hours of access to service as part of the evaluation of effectiveness in the one-stop certification process described in § 678.800(b).</P>
            <P>(d) “Access” to each partner program and its services means:</P>
            <P>(1) Having a program staff member physically present at the one-stop center;</P>
            <P>(2) Having a staff member from a different partner program physically present at the one-stop center appropriately trained to provide information to customers about the programs, services, and activities available through partner programs; or</P>
            <P>(3) Making available a direct linkage through technology to program staff who can provide meaningful information or services.</P>
            <P>(i) A “direct linkage” means providing direct connection at the one-stop center, within a reasonable time, by phone or through a real-time Web-based communication to a program staff member who can provide program information or services to the customer.</P>
            <P>(ii) A “direct linkage” cannot exclusively be providing a phone number or computer Web site or providing information, pamphlets, or materials.</P>
            <P>(e) All comprehensive one-stop centers must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 678.310</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is an affiliated site and what must be provided there?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) An affiliated site, or affiliate one-stop center, is a site that makes available to job seeker and employer customers one or more of the one-stop partners' programs, services, and activities. An affiliated site does not need to provide access to every required one-stop partner program. The frequency of program staff's physical <PRTPAGE P="203"/>presence in the affiliated site will be determined at the local level. Affiliated sites are access points in addition to the comprehensive one-stop center(s) in each local area. If used by local areas as a part of the service delivery strategy, affiliate sites must be implemented in a manner that supplements and enhances customer access to services.</P>
            <P>(b) As described in § 678.315, Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot be a stand-alone affiliated site.</P>
            <P>(c) States, in conjunction with the Local WDBs, must examine lease agreements and property holdings throughout the one-stop delivery system in order to use property in an efficient and effective way. Where necessary and appropriate, States and Local WDBs must take expeditious steps to align lease expiration dates with efforts to consolidate one-stop operations into service points where Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are colocated as soon as reasonably possible. These steps must be included in the State Plan.</P>
            <P>(d) All affiliated sites must be physically and programmatically accessible to individuals with disabilities, as described in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 678.315</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Can a stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service office be designated as an affiliated one-stop site?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Separate stand-alone Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service offices are not permitted under WIOA, as also described in § 652.202 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are provided at an affiliated site, there must be at least one or more other partners in the affiliated site with a physical presence of combined staff more than 50 percent of the time the center is open. Additionally, the other partner must not be the partner administering local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, or unemployment compensation programs. If Wagner-Peyser Act employment services and any of these 3 programs are provided at an affiliated site, an additional partner or partners must have a presence of combined staff in the center more than 50 percent of the time the center is open.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 678.320</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Are there any requirements for networks of eligible one-stop partners or specialized centers?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Any network of one-stop partners or specialized centers, as described in § 678.300(d)(3), must be connected to the comprehensive one-stop center and any appropriate affiliate one-stop centers, for example, by having processes in place to make referrals to these centers and the partner programs located in them. Wagner-Peyser Act employment services cannot stand alone in a specialized center. Just as described in § 678.315 for an affiliated site, a specialized center must include other programs besides Wagner-Peyser Act employment services, local veterans' employment representatives, disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, and unemployment compensation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What entity serves as the one-stop partner for a particular program in the local area?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The entity that carries out the program and activities listed in § 678.400 or § 678.410, and therefore serves as the one-stop partner, is the grant recipient, administrative entity, or organization responsible for administering the funds of the specified program in the local area. The term “entity” does not include the service providers that contract with, or are subrecipients of, the local administrative entity. For <PRTPAGE P="205"/>programs that do not include local administrative entities, the responsible State agency must be the partner. Specific entities for particular programs are identified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. If a program or activity listed in § 678.400 is not carried out in a local area, the requirements relating to a required one-stop partner are not applicable to such program or activity in that local one-stop delivery system.</P>
            <P>(b) For title II of WIOA, the entity or agency that carries out the program for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is the sole entity or agency in the State or outlying area responsible for administering or supervising policy for adult education and literacy activities in the State or outlying area. The State eligible entity or agency may delegate its responsibilities under paragraph (a) of this section to one or more eligible providers or consortium of eligible providers.</P>

            <P>(d) Under WIOA title I, the national programs, including Job Corps, the Native American program, YouthBuild, and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs are required one-stop partners. The entity for the Native American program, YouthBuild, and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs is the grantee of those respective programs. The entity for Job Corps is the Job Corps center.</P>
            <P>(e) For the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the entity that carries out the program for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is the eligible recipient or recipients at the postsecondary level, or a consortium of eligible recipients at the postsecondary level in the local area. The eligible recipient at the postsecondary level may also request assistance from the State eligible agency in completing its responsibilities under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(1) Provide applicable career services; and</P>
            <P>(2) Work collaboratively with the State and Local WDBs to establish and maintain the one-stop delivery system. This includes jointly funding the one-stop infrastructure through partner contributions that are based upon:</P>
            <P>(i) A reasonable cost allocation methodology by which infrastructure costs are charged to each partner based on proportionate use and relative benefit received;</P>
            <P>(ii) Federal cost principles; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Any local administrative cost requirements in the Federal law authorizing the partner's program. (This is further described in § 678.700.)</P>
            <P>(c) Enter into an MOU with the Local WDB relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system that meets the requirements of § 678.500(b);</P>
            <P>(d) Participate in the operation of the one-stop delivery system consistent with the terms of the MOU, requirements of authorizing laws, the Federal cost principles, and all other applicable legal requirements; and</P>

            <P>(2) Outreach, intake (including worker profiling), and orientation to information and other services available through the one-stop delivery system. For the TANF program, States must provide individuals with the opportunity to initiate an application for TANF assistance and non-assistance benefits and services, which could be implemented through the provision of paper application forms or links to the application Web site;</P>
            <P>(3) Initial assessment of skill levels including literacy, numeracy, and English language proficiency, as well as aptitudes, abilities (including skills gaps), and supportive services needs;</P>

            <P>(5) Provision of referrals to and coordination of activities with other programs and services, including programs and services within the one-stop delivery system and, when appropriate, other workforce development programs;</P>
            <P>(6) Provision of workforce and labor market employment statistics information, including the provision of accurate information relating to local, regional, and national labor market areas, including—</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the Memorandum of Understanding for the one-stop delivery system and what must be included in the Memorandum of Understanding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The MOU is the product of local discussion and negotiation, and is an agreement developed and executed between the Local WDB and the one-stop partners, with the agreement of the chief elected official and the one-stop partners, relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system in the local area. Two or more local areas in a region may develop a single joint MOU, if they are in a region that has submitted a regional plan under sec. 106 of WIOA.</P>
            <P>(b) The MOU must include:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of services to be provided through the one-stop delivery system, including the manner in which the services will be coordinated and delivered through the system;</P>
            <P>(2) Agreement on funding the costs of the services and the operating costs of the system, including:</P>
            <P>(i) Funding of infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in accordance with §§ 678.700 through 678.755; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Funding of the shared services and operating costs of the one-stop delivery system described in § 678.760;</P>
            <P>(3) Methods for referring individuals between the one-stop operators and partners for appropriate services and activities;</P>
            <P>(4) Methods to ensure that the needs of workers, youth, and individuals with barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, are addressed in providing access to services, including access to technology and materials that are available through the one-stop delivery system;</P>
            <P>(5) The duration of the MOU and procedures for amending it; and</P>
            <P>(6) Assurances that each MOU will be reviewed, and if substantial changes have occurred, renewed, not less than once every 3-year period to ensure appropriate funding and delivery of services.</P>
            <P>(c) The MOU may contain any other provisions agreed to by the parties that are consistent with WIOA title I, the authorizing statutes and regulations of one-stop partner programs, and the WIOA regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) When fully executed, the MOU must contain the signatures of the Local WDB, one-stop partners, the chief elected official(s), and the time period in which the agreement is effective. The MOU must be updated not less than every 3 years to reflect any changes in the signatory official of the Board, one-stop partners, and chief elected officials, or one-stop infrastructure funding.</P>
            <P>(e) If a one-stop partner appeal to the State regarding infrastructure costs, using the process described in § 678.750, results in a change to the one-stop partner's infrastructure cost contributions, the MOU must be updated to reflect the final one-stop partner infrastructure cost contributions.</P>

            <P>(a) A single “umbrella” MOU may be developed that addresses the issues relating to the local one-stop delivery system for the Local WDB, chief elected official and all partners. Alternatively, the Local WDB (with agreement of chief elected official) may enter into separate agreements between each partner or groups of partners.</P>
            <P>(b) Under either approach, the requirements described in § 678.500 apply. Since funds are generally appropriated annually, the Local WDB may negotiate financial agreements with each partner annually to update funding of services and operating costs of the system under the MOU.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How must the Memorandum of Understanding be negotiated?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) WIOA emphasizes full and effective partnerships between Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners. Local WDBs and partners must enter into good-faith negotiations. Local WDBs, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners may also request assistance from a State agency <PRTPAGE P="210"/>responsible for administering the partner program, the Governor, State WDB, or other appropriate parties on other aspects of the MOU.</P>
            <P>(b) Local WDBs and one-stop partners must establish, in the MOU, how they will fund the infrastructure costs and other shared costs of the one-stop centers. If agreement regarding infrastructure costs is not reached when other sections of the MOU are ready, an interim infrastructure funding agreement may be included instead, as described in § 678.715(c). Once agreement on infrastructure funding is reached, the Local WDB and one-stop partners must amend the MOU to include the infrastructure funding of the one-stop centers. Infrastructure funding is described in detail in subpart E of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) The Local WDB must report to the State WDB, Governor, and relevant State agency when MOU negotiations with one-stop partners have reached an impasse.</P>
            <P>(1) The Local WDB and partners must document the negotiations and efforts that have taken place in the MOU. The State WDB, one-stop partner programs, and the Governor may consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to address impasse situations related to issues other than infrastructure funding after attempting to address the impasse. Impasses related to infrastructure cost funding must be resolved using the State infrastructure cost funding mechanism described in § 678.730.</P>
            <P>(2) The Local WDB must report failure to execute an MOU with a required partner to the Governor, State WDB, and the State agency responsible for administering the partner's program. Additionally, if the State cannot assist the Local WDB in resolving the impasse, the Governor or the State WDB must report the failure to the Secretary of Labor and to the head of any other Federal agency with responsibility for oversight of a partner's program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Who may operate one-stop centers?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) One-stop operators may be a single entity (public, private, or nonprofit) or a consortium of entities. If the consortium of entities is one of one-stop partners, it must include a minimum of three of the one-stop partners described in § 678.400.</P>
            <P>(b) The one-stop operator may operate one or more one-stop centers. There may be more than one one-stop operator in a local area.</P>

            <P>(a) States may select a one-stop operator through sole source selection when allowed under the same policies and procedures used for competitive procurement with non-Federal funds, while other non-Federal entities including subrecipients of a State (such as local areas) may select a one-stop operator through sole selection when consistent with local procurement policies and procedures and the Uniform Guidance set out at 2 CFR 200.320.</P>
            <P>(b) In the event that sole source procurement is determined necessary and reasonable, in accordance with § 678.605(c), written documentation must be prepared and maintained concerning the entire process of making such a selection.</P>
            <P>(c) Such sole source procurement must include appropriate conflict of interest policies and procedures. These policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.</P>
            <P>(d) A Local WDB may be selected as a one-stop operator through sole source procurement only with agreement of the chief elected official in the local area and the Governor.

            <SUBJECT>What is the one-stop operator's role?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) At a minimum, the one-stop operator must coordinate the service delivery of required one-stop partners and service providers. Local WDBs may establish additional roles of one-stop operator, including, but not limited to: Coordinating service providers across the one-stop delivery system, being the primary provider of services within the center, providing some of the services within the center, or coordinating service delivery in a multi-center area, which may include affiliated sites. The competition for a one-stop operator must clearly articulate the role of the one-stop operator.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a one-stop operator may not perform the following functions: Convene system stakeholders to assist in the development of the local plan; prepare and submit local plans (as required under sec. 107 of WIOA); be responsible for oversight of itself; manage or significantly participate in the competitive selection process for one-stop operators; select or terminate one-stop operators, career services, and youth providers; negotiate local performance accountability measures; or develop and submit budget for activities of the Local WDB in the local area.</P>
            <P>(2) An entity serving as a one-stop operator, that also serves a different role within the one-stop delivery system, may perform some or all of these functions when it is acting in its other role, if it has established sufficient firewalls and conflict of interest policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflict of interest.</P>

The operator cannot develop, manage, or conduct the competition of a service provider in which it intends to compete. In cases where an operator is also a service provider, there must be firewalls and internal controls within the operator-service provider entity, as well as specific policies and procedures at the Local WDB level regarding oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of performance of the service provider. The firewalls must conform to the specifications in § 679.430 of this chapter for demonstrating internal controls and preventing conflicts of interest.</P>

            <P>(2) Contributions must be negotiated between one-stop partners, chief elected officials, and the Local WDB and the amount to be contributed must be included in the MOU;</P>
            <P>(3) The one-stop partner program's proportionate share of funding must be calculated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200 based upon a reasonable cost allocation methodology whereby infrastructure costs are charged to each partner in proportion to its use of the one-stop center, relative to benefits received. Such costs must also be allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable;</P>
            <P>(4) Partner shares must be periodically reviewed and reconciled against actual costs incurred, and adjusted to ensure that actual costs charged to any one-stop partners are proportionate to the use of the one-stop center and relative to the benefit received by the one-stop partners and their respective programs or activities.</P>
            <P>(b) In developing the section of the MOU on one-stop infrastructure funding described in § 678.755, the Local WDB and chief elected officials will:</P>

            <SUBJECT>What funds are used to pay for infrastructure costs in the local one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In the local funding mechanism, one-stop partner programs may determine what funds they will use to pay for infrastructure costs. The use of these funds must be in accordance with the requirements in this subpart, and with the relevant partner's authorizing statutes and regulations, including, for example, prohibitions against supplanting non-Federal resources, statutory limitations on administrative costs, and all other applicable legal requirements. In the case of partners administering programs authorized by title I of WIOA, these infrastructure costs may be considered program costs. In the case of partners administering adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA, these funds must include Federal funds made available for the local administration of adult education and literacy programs authorized by title II of WIOA. These funds may also include non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions. In the case of partners administering the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, funds used to pay for infrastructure costs may include funds available for local administrative expenses, non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind or third-party contributions, and may include other funds made available by the State.</P>

            <P>(b) There are no specific caps on the amount or percent of overall funding a one-stop partner may contribute to fund infrastructure costs under the local funding mechanism, except that contributions for administrative costs may not exceed the amount available for administrative costs under the authorizing statute of the partner program. However, amounts contributed for infrastructure costs must be allowable and based on proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received by the partner program, taking into account the total cost of the one-stop infrastructure as well as <PRTPAGE P="215"/>alternate financing options, and must be consistent with 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles.</P>
            <P>(c) Cash, non-cash, and third-party in-kind contributions may be provided by one-stop partners to cover their proportionate share of infrastructure costs.</P>
            <P>(1) Cash contributions are cash funds provided to the Local WDB or its designee by one-stop partners, either directly or by an interagency transfer.</P>
            <P>(2) Non-cash contributions are comprised of—</P>
            <P>(i) Expenditures incurred by one-stop partners on behalf of the one-stop center; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Non-cash contributions or goods or services contributed by a partner program and used by the one-stop center.</P>
            <P>(3) Non-cash contributions, especially those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the partners' proportionate share.</P>
            <P>(4) Third-party in-kind contributions are:</P>
            <P>(i) Contributions of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, by a non-one-stop partner to support the one-stop center in general, not a specific partner; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Contributions by a non-one-stop partner of space, equipment, technology, non-personnel services, or other like items to support the infrastructure costs associated with one-stop operations, to a one-stop partner to support its proportionate share of one-stop infrastructure costs.</P>
            <P>(iii) In-kind contributions described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section must be valued consistent with 2 CFR 200.306 and reconciled on a regular basis to ensure they are fairly evaluated and meet the proportionate share of the partner.</P>

            <P>(5) All partner contributions, regardless of the type, must be reconciled on a regular basis (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> monthly or quarterly), comparing actual expenses incurred to relative benefits received, to ensure each partner program is contributing its proportionate share in accordance with the terms of the MOU.</P>

            <P>(a) Consistent with sec. 121(h)(1)(A)(i)(II) of WIOA, if the Local WDB, chief elected official, and one-stop partners in a local area do not reach consensus agreement on methods of sufficiently funding the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers for a program year, the State funding mechanism is applicable to the local area for that program year.</P>
            <P>(b) In the State funding mechanism, the Governor, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section, determines one-stop partner contributions after consultation with the chief elected officials, Local WDBs, and the State WDB. This determination involves:</P>
            <P>(1) The application of a budget for one-stop infrastructure costs as described in § 678.735, based on either agreement reached in the local area negotiations or the State WDB formula outlined in § 678.745;</P>

            <P>(2) The determination of each local one-stop partner program's proportionate use of the one-stop delivery system and relative benefit received, <PRTPAGE P="216"/>consistent with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, including the Federal cost principles, the partner programs' authorizing laws and regulations, and other applicable legal requirements described in § 678.736; and</P>
            <P>(3) The calculation of required statewide program caps on contributions to infrastructure costs from one-stop partner programs in areas operating under the State funding mechanism as described in § 678.738.</P>
            <P>(c) In certain situations, the Governor does not determine the infrastructure cost contributions for some one-stop partner programs under the State funding mechanism.</P>
            <P>(1) The Governor will not determine the contribution amounts for infrastructure funds for Native American program grantees described in part 684 of this chapter. The appropriate portion of funds to be provided by Native American program grantees to pay for one-stop infrastructure must be determined as part of the development of the MOU described in § 678.500 and specified in that MOU.</P>
            <P>(2) In States in which the policy-making authority is placed in an entity or official that is independent of the authority of the Governor with respect to the funds provided for adult education and literacy activities authorized under title II of WIOA, postsecondary career and technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, or VR services authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (other than sec. 112 or part C), as amended by WIOA title IV, the determination of the amount each of the applicable partners must contribute to assist in paying the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers must be made by the official or chief officer of the entity with such authority, in consultation with the Governor.</P>
            <P>(d) Any duty, ability, choice, responsibility, or other action otherwise related to the determination of infrastructure costs contributions that is assigned to the Governor in §§ 678.730 through 678.745 also applies to this decision-making process performed by the official or chief officer described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the steps to determine the amount to be paid under the State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To initiate the State funding mechanism, a Local WDB that has not reached consensus on methods of sufficiently funding local infrastructure through the local funding mechanism as provided in § 678.725 must notify the Governor by the deadline established by the Governor under § 678.705(b)(3).</P>
            <P>(b) Once a Local WDB has informed the Governor that no consensus has been reached:</P>
            <P>(1) The Local WDB must provide the Governor with local negotiation materials in accordance with § 678.735(a).</P>
            <P>(2) The Governor must determine the one-stop center budget by either:</P>
            <P>(i) Accepting a budget previously agreed upon by partner programs in the local negotiations, in accordance with § 678.735(b)(1); or</P>
            <P>(ii) Creating a budget for the one-stop center using the State WDB formula (described in § 678.745) in accordance with § 678.735(b)(3).</P>
            <P>(3) The Governor then must establish a cost allocation methodology to determine the one-stop partner programs' proportionate shares of infrastructure costs, in accordance with § 678.736.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) Using the methodology established under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and taking into consideration the factors concerning individual partner programs listed in § 678.737(b)(2), the Governor must determine each partner's proportionate share of the infrastructure costs, in accordance with § 678.737(b)(1), and</P>
            <P>(ii) In accordance with § 678.730(c), in some instances, the Governor does not determine a partner program's proportionate share of infrastructure funding costs, in which case it must be determined by the entities named in § 678.730(c)(1) and (2).</P>

            <P>(5) The Governor must then calculate the statewide caps on the amounts that partner programs may be required to contribute toward infrastructure funding, according to the steps found at § 678.738(a)(1) through (4).<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
            </P>
            <P>(6) The Governor must ensure that the aggregate total of the infrastructure contributions according to proportionate share required of all local partner programs in local areas under the State funding mechanism do not exceed the cap for that particular program, in accordance with § 678.738(b)(1). If the total does not exceed the cap, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the amount determined under § 678.737(a) toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center. If the total does exceed the cap, then to determine the amount to direct each one-stop program to pay, the Governor may:</P>
            <P>(i) Ascertain, in accordance with § 678.738(b)(2)(i), whether the local partner or partners whose proportionate shares are calculated above the individual program caps are willing to voluntarily contribute above the capped amount to equal that program's proportionate share; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Choose from the options provided in § 678.738(b)(2)(ii), including having the local area re-enter negotiations to reassess each one-stop partner's proportionate share and make adjustments or identify alternate sources of funding to make up the difference between the capped amount and the proportionate share of infrastructure funding of the one-stop partner.</P>
            <P>(7) If none of the solutions given in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section prove to be viable, the Governor must reassess the proportionate shares of each one-stop partner so that the aggregate amount attributable to the local partners for each program is less than that program's cap amount. Upon such reassessment, the Governor must direct each one-stop partner program to pay the reassessed amount toward the infrastructure funding costs of the one-stop center.</P>

            <P>(a) Local WDBs must provide to the Governor appropriate and relevant materials and documents used in the negotiations under the local funding mechanism, including but not limited to: The local WIOA plan, the cost allocation method or methods proposed by the partners to be used in determining proportionate share, the proposed amounts or budget to fund infrastructure, the amount of total partner funds included, the type of funds or non-cash contributions, proposed one-stop center budgets, and any agreed upon or proposed MOUs.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) If a local area has reached agreement as to the infrastructure budget for the one-stop centers in the local area, it must provide this budget to the Governor as required by paragraph (a) of this section. If, as a result of the agreed upon infrastructure budget, only the individual programmatic contributions to infrastructure funding based upon proportionate use of the one-stop centers and relative benefit received are at issue, the Governor may accept the budget, from which the Governor must calculate each partner's contribution consistent with the cost allocation methodologies contained in the Uniform Guidance found in 2 CFR part 200, as described in § 678.736.</P>
            <P>(2) The Governor may also take into consideration the extent to which the partners in the local area have agreed in determining the proportionate shares, including any agreements reached at the local level by one or more partners, as well as any other element or product of the negotiating process provided to the Governor as required by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) If a local area has not reached agreement as to the infrastructure budget for the one-stop centers in the local area, or if the Governor determines that the agreed upon budget does not adequately meet the needs of the local area or does not reasonably work within the confines of the local area's resources in accordance with the Governor's one-stop budget guidance (which is required to be issued by WIOA sec. 121(h)(1)(B) and under § 678.705), then, in accordance with § 678.745, the Governor must use the formula developed by the State WDB based on at least the factors required under § 678.745, and any associated weights to determine the local area budget.</P>

            <P>(a) The Governor must calculate the statewide cap on the contributions for one-stop infrastructure funding required to be provided by each one-stop partner program for those local areas that have not reached agreement. The cap is the amount determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, which the Governor derives by:</P>
            <P>(1) First, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage for the corresponding one-stop partner program provided in paragraph (d) of this section to the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out the one-stop partner program in the State for the applicable fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(2) Second, selecting a factor (or factors) that reasonably indicates the use of one-stop centers in the State, applying such factor(s) to all local areas in the State, and determining the percentage of such factor(s) applicable to the local areas that reached agreement under the local funding mechanism in the State;</P>
            <P>(3) Third, determining the amount resulting from applying the percentage determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the one-stop partner program; and</P>
            <P>(4) Fourth, determining the amount that results from subtracting the amount determined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The outcome of this final calculation results in the partner program's cap.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) The Governor must ensure that the funds required to be contributed by each partner program in the local areas in the State under the State funding <PRTPAGE P="219"/>mechanism, in aggregate, do not exceed the statewide cap for each program as determined under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If the contributions initially determined under § 678.737 would exceed the applicable cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Governor may:</P>
            <P>(i) Ascertain if the one-stop partner whose contribution would otherwise exceed the cap determined under paragraph (a) of this section will voluntarily contribute above the capped amount, so that the total contributions equal that partner's proportionate share. The one-stop partner's contribution must still be consistent with the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Direct or allow the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners to: Re-enter negotiations, as necessary; reduce the infrastructure costs to reflect the amount of funds that are available for such costs without exceeding the cap levels; reassess the proportionate share of each one-stop partner; or identify alternative sources of financing for one-stop infrastructure funding, consistent with the requirement that each one-stop partner pay an amount that is consistent with the proportionate use of the one-stop center and relative benefit received by the partner, the program's authorizing laws and regulations, the Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, and other applicable legal requirements.</P>
            <P>(3) If applicable under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners, after renegotiation, may come to agreement, sign an MOU, and proceed under the local funding mechanism. Such actions do not require the redetermination of the applicable caps under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) If, after renegotiation, agreement among partners still cannot be reached or alternate financing cannot be identified, the Governor may adjust the specified allocation, in accordance with the amounts available and the limitations described in paragraph (d) of this section. In determining these adjustments, the Governor may take into account information relating to the renegotiation as well as the information described in § 678.735(a).</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other one-stop partners.</E> For required one-stop partners other than those specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (3), (5), and (6) of this section, the portion of funds required to be contributed must not exceed 1.5 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year. For purposes of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, the cap on contributions is determined based on the funds made available by the State for postsecondary level programs and activities under sec. 132 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the amount of funds used by the State under sec. 112(a)(3) of the Perkins Act during the prior year to administer postsecondary level programs and activities, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Vocational rehabilitation.</E> (i) Within a State, for the entity or entities administering the programs described in WIOA sec. 121(b)(1)(B)(iv) and § 678.400, the allotment is based on the one State Federal fiscal year allotment, even in instances where that allotment is shared between two State agencies, and the cumulative portion of funds required to be contributed must not exceed—</P>

            <P>(A) 0.75 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2016 for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2017;<PRTPAGE P="220"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) 1.0 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2017 for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2018;</P>
            <P>(C) 1.25 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2018 for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2019;</P>
            <P>(D) 1.5 percent of the amount provided to carry out such program in the State for Fiscal Year 2019 and following years for purposes of applicability of the State funding mechanism for PY 2020 and subsequent years.</P>
            <P>(ii) The limitations set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section for any given fiscal year must be based on the final VR allotment to the State in the applicable Federal fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Federal direct spending programs.</E> For local areas that have not reached a one-stop infrastructure funding agreement by consensus, an entity administering a program funded with direct Federal spending, as defined in sec. 250(c)(8) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as in effect on February 15, 2014 (2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)), must not be required to provide more for infrastructure costs than the amount that the Governor determined (as described in § 678.737).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">TANF programs.</E> For purposes of TANF, the cap on contributions is determined based on the total Federal TANF funds expended by the State for work, education, and training activities during the prior Federal fiscal year (as reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the quarterly TANF Financial Report form), plus any additional amount of Federal TANF funds that the State TANF agency reasonably determines was expended for administrative costs in connection with these activities but that was separately reported to HHS as an administrative cost. The State's contribution to the one-stop infrastructure must not exceed 1.5 percent of these combined expenditures.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) programs.</E> For purposes of CSBG, the cap on contributions will be based on the total amount of CSBG funds determined by the State to have been expended by local CSBG-eligible entities for the provision of employment and training activities during the prior Federal fiscal year for which information is available (as reported to HHS on the CSBG Annual Report) and any additional amount that the State CSBG agency reasonably determines was expended for administrative purposes in connection with these activities and was separately reported to HHS as an administrative cost. The State's contribution must not exceed 1.5 percent of these combined expenditures.</P>
            <P>(d) For programs for which it is not otherwise feasible to determine the amount of Federal funding used by the program until the end of that program's operational year—because, for example, the funding available for education, employment, and training activities is included within funding for the program that may also be used for other unrelated activities—the determination of the Federal funds provided to carry out the program for a fiscal year under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be determined by:</P>
            <P>(1) The percentage of Federal funds available to the one-stop partner program that were used by the one-stop partner program for education, employment, and training activities in the previous fiscal year for which data are available; and</P>
            <P>(2) Applying the percentage determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the total amount of Federal funds available to the one-stop partner program for the fiscal year for which the determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies.</P>

            <P>(a) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for WIOA title I programs, including Native American Programs described in part 684 of this chapter, may be paid using program funds, administrative funds, or both. Infrastructure costs for the Senior Community Service Employment Program under title V of the Older Americans Act (42 U.S.C. 3056 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) may <PRTPAGE P="221"/>also be paid using program funds, administrative funds, or both.</P>
            <P>(b) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for other required one-stop partner programs (listed in §§ 678.400 through 678.410) are limited to the program's administrative funds, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for the adult education program authorized by title II of WIOA must be paid from the funds that are available for local administration and may be paid from funds made available by the State or non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind, or third-party contributions.</P>
            <P>(d) In the State funding mechanism, infrastructure costs for the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 must be paid from funds available for local administration of postsecondary level programs and activities to eligible recipients or consortia of eligible recipients and may be paid from funds made available by the State or non-Federal resources that are cash, in-kind, or third-party contributions.</P>

            <P>The State WDB must develop a formula, as described in WIOA sec. 121(h)(3)(B), to be used by the Governor under § 678.735(b)(3) in determining the appropriate budget for the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers in the local areas that do not reach agreement under the local funding mechanism and are, therefore, subject to the State funding mechanism. The formula identifies the factors and corresponding weights for each factor that the Governor must use, which must include: The number of one-stop centers in a local area; the population served by such centers; the services provided by such centers; and any factors relating to the operations of such centers in the local area that the State WDB determines are appropriate. As indicated in § 678.735(b)(1), if the local area has agreed on such a budget, the Governor may accept that budget in lieu of applying the formula factors.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When and how can a one-stop partner appeal a one-stop infrastructure amount designated by the State under the State infrastructure funding mechanism?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Governor must establish a process, described under sec. 121(h)(2)(E) of WIOA, for a one-stop partner administering a program described in §§ 678.400 through 678.410 to appeal the Governor's determination regarding the one-stop partner's portion of funds to be provided for one-stop infrastructure costs. This appeal process must be described in the Unified State Plan.</P>
            <P>(b) The appeal may be made on the ground that the Governor's determination is inconsistent with proportionate share requirements in § 678.735(a), the cost contribution limitations in § 678.735(b), the cost contribution caps in § 678.738, consistent with the process described in the State Plan.</P>
            <P>(c) The process must ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of § 683.630 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) The one-stop partner must submit an appeal in accordance with State's deadlines for appeals specified in the guidance issued under § 678.705(b)(3), or if the State has not set a deadline, within 21 days from the Governor's determination.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do one-stop partners jointly fund other shared costs under the Memorandum of Understanding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In addition to jointly funding infrastructure costs, one-stop partners listed in §§ 678.400 through 678.410 must use a portion of funds made available under their programs' authorizing Federal law (or fairly evaluated in-kind contributions) to pay the additional costs relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system. These other costs must include applicable career services and may include other costs, including shared services.</P>
            <P>(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, shared services' costs may include the costs of shared services that are authorized for and may be commonly provided through the one-stop partner programs to any individual, such as initial intake, assessment of needs, appraisal of basic skills, identification of appropriate services to meet such needs, referrals to other one-stop partners, and business services. Shared operating costs may also include shared costs of the Local WDB's functions.</P>
            <P>(c) Contributions to the additional costs related to operation of the one-stop delivery system may be cash, non-cash, or third-party in-kind contributions, consistent with how these are described in § 678.720(c).</P>
            <P>(d) The shared costs described in paragraph (a) of this section must be allocated according to the proportion of benefit received by each of the partners, consistent with the Federal law authorizing the partner's program, and consistent with all other applicable legal requirements, including Federal cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling) requiring that costs are allowable, reasonable, necessary, and allocable.</P>
            <P>(e) Any shared costs agreed upon by the one-stop partners must be included in the MOU.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are one-stop centers and one-stop delivery systems certified for effectiveness, physical and programmatic accessibility, and continuous improvement?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The State WDB, in consultation with chief elected officials and Local WDBs, must establish objective criteria and procedures for Local WDBs to use when certifying one-stop centers.</P>
            <P>(1) The State WDB, in consultation with chief elected officials and Local WDBs, must review and update the criteria every 2 years as part of the review and modification of State Plans pursuant to § 676.135 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) The criteria must be consistent with the Governor's and State WDB's guidelines, guidance, and policies on infrastructure funding decisions, described in § 678.705. The criteria must evaluate the one-stop centers and one-stop delivery system for effectiveness, including customer satisfaction, physical and programmatic accessibility, and continuous improvement.</P>
            <P>(3) When the Local WDB is the one-stop operator as described in § 679.410 of this chapter, the State WDB must certify the one-stop center.</P>

            <P>(b) Evaluations of effectiveness must include how well the one-stop center integrates available services for participants and businesses, meets the <PRTPAGE P="223"/>workforce development needs of participants and the employment needs of local employers, operates in a cost-efficient manner, coordinates services among the one-stop partner programs, and provides access to partner program services to the maximum extent practicable, including providing services outside of regular business hours where there is a workforce need, as identified by the Local WDB. These evaluations must take into account feedback from one-stop customers. They must also include evaluations of how well the one-stop center ensures equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities to participate in or benefit from one-stop center services. These evaluations must include criteria evaluating how well the centers and delivery systems take actions to comply with the disability-related regulations implementing WIOA sec. 188, set forth at 29 CFR part 38. Such actions include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Providing reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities;</P>
            <P>(2) Making reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where necessary to avoid discrimination against persons with disabilities;</P>
            <P>(3) Administering programs in the most integrated setting appropriate;</P>
            <P>(4) Communicating with persons with disabilities as effectively as with others;</P>
            <P>(5) Providing appropriate auxiliary aids and services, including assistive technology devices and services, where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the program or activity; and</P>
            <P>(6) Providing for the physical accessibility of the one-stop center to individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(c) Evaluations of continuous improvement must include how well the one-stop center supports the achievement of the negotiated local levels of performance for the indicators of performance for the local area described in sec. 116(b)(2) of WIOA and part 677 of this chapter. Other continuous improvement factors may include a regular process for identifying and responding to technical assistance needs, a regular system of continuing professional staff development, and having systems in place to capture and respond to specific customer feedback.</P>
            <P>(d) Local WDBs must assess at least once every 3 years the effectiveness, physical and programmatic accessibility, and continuous improvement of one-stop centers and the one-stop delivery systems using the criteria and procedures developed by the State WDB. The Local WDB may establish additional criteria, or set higher standards for service coordination, than those set by the State criteria. Local WDBs must review and update the criteria every 2 years as part of the Local Plan update process described in § 676.580 of this chapter. Local WDBs must certify one-stop centers in order to be eligible to use infrastructure funds in the State funding mechanism described in § 678.730.</P>
            <P>(e) All one-stop centers must comply with applicable physical and programmatic accessibility requirements, as set forth in 29 CFR part 38, the implementing regulations of WIOA sec. 188.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the role of the adult and dislocated worker programs in the one-stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The one-stop delivery system is the basic delivery system for adult and dislocated worker services. Through this system, adults and dislocated workers can access a continuum of services. The services are classified as career and training services.</P>

            <P>(b) The chief elected official or his/her designee(s), as the local grant recipient(s) for the adult and dislocated worker programs, is a required one-<PRTPAGE P="251"/>stop partner and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in part 678 of this chapter. Consistent with those provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) Career services for adults and dislocated workers must be made available in at least one one-stop center in each local area. Services also may be available elsewhere, either at affiliated sites or at specialized centers. For example, specialized centers may be established to serve workers being dislocated from a particular employer or industry, or to serve residents of public housing.</P>
            <P>(2) Through the one-stop delivery system, adults and dislocated workers needing training are provided Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) and access to lists of eligible training providers and programs of training. These lists contain quality consumer information, including cost and performance information for each of the providers' programs, so that participants can make informed choices on where to use their ITAs. (ITAs are more fully discussed in subpart C of this part.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>When must adults and dislocated workers be registered and considered a participant?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Registration is the process for collecting information to support a determination of eligibility. This information may be collected through methods that include electronic data transfer, personal interview, or an individual's application. Individuals are considered participants when they have received a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) service other than self-service or information-only activities and have satisfied all applicable programmatic requirements for the provision of services, such as eligibility determination (<E T="03">see</E> § 677.150(a) of this chapter).</P>
            <P>(b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under WIOA title I other than self-service or information-only activities must be registered and must be a participant.</P>
            <P>(c) EO data, as defined in § 675.300 of this chapter, must be collected on every individual who is interested in being considered for WIOA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a recipient, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal information in response to a request from the grant recipient or designated service provider.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the eligibility criteria for career services for adults in the adult and dislocated worker programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>To be eligible to receive career services as an adult in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must be 18 years of age or older. To be eligible for any dislocated worker programs, an eligible adult must meet the criteria of § 680.130. Eligibility criteria for training services are found at § 680.210.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the eligibility criteria for career services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be eligible to receive career services as a dislocated worker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must meet the definition of “dislocated worker” at WIOA sec. 3(15). Eligibility criteria for training services are found at § 680.210.</P>
            <P>(b) Governors and Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) may establish policies and procedures for one-stop centers to use in determining an individual's eligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at WIOA sec. 3(15). These policies and procedures may address such conditions as:</P>
            <P>(1) What constitutes a “general announcement” of plant closing under WIOA sec. 3(15)(B)(ii) or (iii);</P>
            <P>(2) What constitutes “unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters” for determining the eligibility of self-employed individuals, including family members and farm workers or ranch hands, under WIOA sec. 3(15)(C); and</P>
            <P>(3) What constitutes “unlikely to return to a previous industry or occupation” under WIOA sec. 3(15)(A)(iii), consistent with § 680.660.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I adult and dislocated worker services are Local Workforce Development Boards required and permitted to provide?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) WIOA title I formula funds allocated to local areas for adults and dislocated workers must be used to provide career and training services through the one-stop delivery system. Local WDBs determine the most appropriate mix of these services, but both types must be available for eligible adults and dislocated workers. Different eligibility criteria apply for each type of services. <E T="03">See</E> §§ 680.120, 680.130, and 680.210.</P>
            <P>(b) WIOA title I funds also may be used to provide the additional services described in WIOA sec. 134(d), including:</P>
            <P>(1) Job seeker services, such as:</P>
            <P>(i) Customer support to enable individuals with barriers to employment (including individuals with disabilities) and veterans, to navigate among multiple services and activities;</P>
            <P>(ii) Training programs for displaced homemakers and for individuals training for nontraditional employment (as defined in WIOA sec. 3(37) as occupations or fields of work in which individuals of one gender comprise less than 25 percent of the individuals so employed), in conjunction with programs operated in the local area;</P>
            <P>(iii) Work support activities for low-wage workers, in coordination with one-stop partners, which will provide opportunities for these workers to retain or enhance employment. These activities may include any activities available under the WIOA adult and dislocated worker programs in coordination with activities and resources available through partner programs. These activities may be provided in a manner that enhances the worker's ability to participate, for example by providing them at nontraditional hours or providing on-site child care;</P>
            <P>(iv) Supportive services, including needs-related payments, as described in subpart G of this part; and</P>
            <P>(v) Transitional jobs, as described in § 680.190, to individuals with barriers to employment who are chronically unemployed or have an inconsistent work history;</P>
            <P>(2) Employer services, such as:</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are training services provided?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Training services for eligible individuals are typically provided by training providers who receive payment for their services through an ITA. The ITA is a payment agreement established on behalf of a participant with a training provider. WIOA title I adult and dislocated workers purchase training services from State eligible training providers they select in consultation with the career planner, which includes discussion of program quality and performance information on the available eligible training providers. Payments from ITAs may be made in a variety of ways, including the electronic transfer of funds through financial institutions, vouchers, or other appropriate methods. Payments also may be made incrementally, for example, through payment of a portion of the costs at different points in the training course. Under limited conditions, as provided in § 680.320 and WIOA sec. 134(d)(3)(G), a Local WDB may contract for these services, rather than using an ITA for this purpose. In some limited circumstances, the Local WDB may itself provide the training services, but only if it obtains a waiver from the Governor for this purpose, and the Local WDB meets the other requirements of § 679.410 of this chapter and WIOA sec. 107(g)(1).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Can the duration and amount of Individual Training Accounts be limited?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Yes, the State or Local WDB may impose limits on ITAs, such as limitations on the dollar amount and/or duration.</P>
            <P>(b) Limits to ITAs may be established in different ways:</P>
            <P>(1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is based on the needs identified in the IEP, such as the participant's occupational choice or goal and the level of training needed to succeed in that goal; or</P>
            <P>(2) There may be a policy decision by the State WDB or Local WDB to establish a range of amounts and/or a maximum amount applicable to all ITAs.</P>
            <P>(c) Limitations established by State or Local WDB policies must be described in the State or Local Plan, respectively, but must not be implemented in a manner that undermines WIOA's requirement that training services are provided in a manner that maximizes customer choice in the selection of an ETP. Exceptions to ITA limitations may be provided for individual cases and must be described in State or Local WDB policies.</P>
            <P>(d) An individual may select training that costs more than the maximum amount available for ITAs under a State or local policy when other sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other sources may include: Pell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and other sources.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than Individual Training Accounts be used to provide training services?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Contracts for services may be used instead of ITAs only when one or more of the following five exceptions apply, and the local area has fulfilled the consumer choice requirements of § 680.340:</P>
            <P>(1) When the services provided are on-the-job-training (OJT), customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional jobs.</P>
            <P>(2) When the Local WDB determines that there are an insufficient number of eligible training providers in the local area to accomplish the purpose of a system of ITAs. The determination process must include a public comment period for interested providers of at least 30 days, and be described in the Local Plan.</P>

            <P>(3) When the Local WDB determines that there is a training services program of demonstrated effectiveness offered in the area by a community-based organization or another private organization to serve individuals with barriers to employment, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. The Local WDB must develop criteria to be used in determining demonstrated effectiveness, particularly as it applies to the <PRTPAGE P="257"/>individuals with barriers to employment to be served. The criteria may include:</P>
            <P>(i) Financial stability of the organization;</P>
            <P>(ii) Demonstrated performance in the delivery of services to individuals with barriers to employment through such means as program completion rate; attainment of the skills, certificates or degrees the program is designed to provide; placement after training in unsubsidized employment; and retention in employment; and</P>
            <P>(iii) How the specific program relates to the workforce investment needs identified in the local plan.</P>

            <P>(4) When the Local WDB determines that it would be most appropriate to contract with an institution of higher education (<E T="03">see</E> WIOA sec. 3(28)) or other provider of training services in order to facilitate the training of multiple individuals in in-demand industry sectors or occupations, provided that the contract does not limit consumer choice.</P>
            <P>(5) When the Local WDB is considering entering into a Pay-for-Performance contract, and the Local WDB ensures that the contract is consistent with § 683.510 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, individuals with barriers to employment include those individuals in one or more of the following categories, as prescribed by WIOA sec. 3(24):</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart describes the process for determining eligible training providers and programs for WIOA title I, subtitle B adult, dislocated worker, and out-of-school youth (OSY) aged 16-24 training participants and for publicly disseminating the list of these providers with relevant information about their programs. The workforce development system established under WIOA emphasizes informed consumer choice, job-driven training, provider performance, and continuous improvement. The quality and selection of providers and programs of training services is vital to achieving these core principles.</P>

            <P>(b) The State list of eligible training providers and programs and the related eligibility procedures ensure the accountability, quality and labor-market relevance of programs of training services that receive funds through WIOA title I, subtitle B. The State list of eligible training providers and programs also is a means for ensuring informed customer choice for individuals eligible for training. In administering the eligible training provider eligibility process, States and local areas must work to ensure that qualified providers offering a wide variety of job-driven programs of training services are available. The State list of eligible training providers and programs is made publicly available online through Web sites and searchable databases as well as any other means the State uses to disseminate information to consumers, including formats accessible to individuals with disabilities. The list must be accompanied by relevant performance <PRTPAGE P="259"/>and cost information and must be presented in a way that is easily understood, in order to maximize informed consumer choice and serve all significant population groups, and also must be available in an electronic format. The State eligible training provider performance reports, as required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4), are addressed separately in § 677.230 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the initial eligibility process for new providers and programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All providers and programs that have not previously been eligible to provide training services under WIOA sec. 122 or WIA sec. 122, except for registered apprenticeship programs, must submit required information to be considered for initial eligibility in accordance with the Governor's procedures.</P>
            <P>(b) Apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act are exempt from initial eligibility procedures. Registered apprenticeship programs must be included and maintained on the State list of eligible training providers and programs as long as the program remains registered, unless the registered apprenticeship program is removed from the list for a reason set forth in § 680.470. Procedures for registered apprenticeship programs to be included and maintained on the list are described in § 680.470.</P>
            <P>(c) In establishing the State requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Governor must, in consultation with the State WDB, develop a procedure for determining the eligibility of training providers and programs. This procedure, which must be described in the State Plan, must be developed after:</P>
            <P>(1) Soliciting and taking into consideration recommendations from Local WDBs and providers of training services within the State;</P>

            <P>(3) Describe whether the provider is in a partnership with a business;</P>
            <P>(4) Provide other information the Governor may require in order to demonstrate high quality programs of training services, which may include information related to training services that lead to a recognized postsecondary credential; and</P>
            <P>(5) Provide information that addresses alignment of the training services with in-demand industry sectors and occupations, to the extent possible.</P>
            <P>(f) In establishing the initial eligibility procedures and criteria, the Governor may establish minimum performance standards, based on the performance information described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) Under WIOA sec. 122(b)(4)(B), eligible training providers receive initial eligibility for only 1 year for a particular program.</P>
            <P>(h) After the initial eligibility expires, these initially eligible training providers are subject to the Governor's application procedures for continued eligibility, described at § 680.460, in order to remain eligible.</P>

            <P>(2) Providing an opportunity for interested members of the public, including representatives of business and labor organizations, to submit comments on such procedure; and</P>
            <P>(3) Designating a specific time period for soliciting and considering the recommendations of Local WDBs and providers, and for providing an opportunity for public comment.</P>
            <P>(c) Procedures for registered apprenticeship programs to be included and maintained on the list are described in § 680.470. Apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act must be included and maintained on the State list of eligible training providers and programs as long as the program remains registered, unless the registered apprenticeship program is removed from the list for a reason set forth in § 680.470.</P>
            <P>(d) The application procedure must describe the roles of the State and local areas in receiving and reviewing provider applications and in making eligibility determinations.</P>
            <P>(e) The application procedure must be described in the State Plan.</P>
            <P>(f) In establishing eligibility criteria, the Governor must take into account:</P>

            <P>(i) The performance accountability measures described in WIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(A)(i)(I)-(IV) and the other matters required by WIOA sec. 122(b)(2);</P>
            <P>(ii) Other appropriate measures of performance outcomes determined by the Governor for program participants receiving training services under WIOA title I, subtitle B, taking into consideration the characteristics of the population served and relevant economic conditions; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Outcomes of the program for students in general with respect to employment and earnings as defined in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2).</P>
            <P>(iv) All of these measures may include minimum performance standards.</P>

            <P>(v) Until data from the conclusion of each performance indicator's first data cycle are available, the Governor may <PRTPAGE P="262"/>take into account alternate factors related to the measures described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Ensuring access to training services throughout the State, including in rural areas, and through the use of technology;</P>
            <P>(3) Information reported to State agencies on Federal and State training programs other than programs within WIOA title I, subtitle B;</P>
            <P>(4) The degree to which programs of training services relate to in-demand industry sectors and occupations in the State;</P>
            <P>(5) State licensure requirements of training providers;</P>
            <P>(6) Encouraging the use of industry-recognized certificates and credentials;</P>
            <P>(7) The ability of providers to offer programs of training services that lead to postsecondary credentials;</P>
            <P>(8) The quality of the program of training services including a program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential;</P>
            <P>(9) The ability of the providers to provide training services to individuals who are employed and individuals with barriers to employment;</P>
            <P>(10) Whether the providers timely and accurately submitted all of the information required for completion of eligible training provider performance reports required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4) and all of the information required for initial and continued eligibility in this subpart; and</P>
            <P>(11) Other factors that the Governor determines are appropriate in order to ensure: The accountability of providers; that one-stop centers in the State will meet the needs of local employers and participants; and, that participants will be given an informed choice among providers.</P>
            <P>(g) The information requirements that the Governor establishes under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must require eligible training providers to submit appropriate, accurate, and timely information for participants receiving training under WIOA title I, subtitle B.

            <P>(h) The eligibility criteria must require that:</P>
            <P>(1) Providers submit performance and cost information as described in paragraph (g) of this section and in the Governor's procedures for each program of training services for which the provider has been determined to be eligible, in a timeframe and manner determined by the State, but at least every 2 years; and</P>
            <P>(2) That the collection of information required to demonstrate compliance with the criteria is not unduly burdensome or costly to providers.</P>
            <P>(i) The procedure for continued eligibility also must provide for the State biennially to review provider eligibility information to assess the renewal of training provider eligibility. Such procedures may establish minimum levels of training provider performance as criteria for continued eligibility.</P>
            <P>(j) The procedure for biennial review of the provider eligibility must include verification of the registration status of registered apprenticeship programs and removal of any registered apprenticeship programs as described in § 680.470.</P>

            <P>(k) The Governor may establish procedures and timeframes for providing technical assistance to eligible training providers who are not intentionally supplying inaccurate information or who have not substantially violated <PRTPAGE P="263"/>any of the requirements under this section but are failing to meet the criteria and information requirements due to undue cost or burden.</P>
            <P>(l) The Governor's procedures must include what the Governor considers to be a substantial violation of the requirement to timely and accurately submit all of the information required for completion of the eligible training provider performance reports required under WIOA sec. 116(d)(4) and all of the information required for initial and continued eligibility in this subpart.</P>
            <P>(1) The Governor's procedures on determining a substantial violation must take into account exceptional circumstances beyond the provider's control, such as natural disasters, unexpected personnel transitions, and unexpected technology-related issues.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the procedures for including and removing registered apprenticeship programs on a State list of eligible training providers and programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All registered apprenticeship programs that are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Apprenticeship, or a recognized State apprenticeship agency, are automatically eligible to be included in the State list of eligible training providers and programs. All registered apprenticeship programs must be informed of their automatic eligibility to be included on the list, and must be provided an opportunity to consent to their inclusion, before being placed on the State list of eligible training providers and programs. The Governor must establish a mechanism for registered apprenticeship program sponsors in the State to be informed of their automatic eligibility and to indicate that the program sponsor wishes to be included on the State list of eligible training providers and programs. This mechanism must place minimal burden on registered apprenticeship program sponsors and must be developed in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship or with the assistance of the recognized State apprenticeship agency, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(b) Once on the State list of eligible training providers and programs, registered apprenticeship programs will remain on the list:</P>
            <P>(1) Until they are deregistered;</P>
            <P>(2) Until the registered apprenticeship program notifies the State that it no longer wants to be included on the list; or</P>
            <P>(3) Until the registered apprenticeship program is determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have substantially violated any provision of title I of WIOA or the WIOA regulations, including 29 CFR part 38.</P>
            <P>(c) A registered apprenticeship program whose eligibility is terminated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section must be terminated for not less than 2 years and is liable to repay all youth, adult, and dislocated worker training funds it received during the period of noncompliance. The Governor must specify in the procedures required by § 680.480 which individual or entity is responsible for making these determinations and the process by which the determination will be made, which must include an opportunity for a hearing that meets the requirements of § 683.630(b) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) Inclusion of a registered apprenticeship in the State list of eligible training providers and programs allows an individual who is eligible to use WIOA title I, subtitle B funds to use those funds toward registered apprenticeship training, consistent with their availability and limitations as prescribed by § 680.300. The use of ITAs and other WIOA title I, subtitle B funds toward registered apprenticeship training is further described in § 680.330.</P>
            <P>(e) The Governor is encouraged to consult with the State and Local WDBs, ETA's Office of Apprenticeship, recognized State apprenticeship agencies (where they exist in the Governor's State) or other State agencies, to establish voluntary reporting of performance information.</P>

            <P>(f) Pre-apprenticeship providers that wish to provide training services to <PRTPAGE P="264"/>participants using WIOA title I, subtitle B funds are subject to the eligibility procedures of this subpart.</P>

            <SUBJECT>May an eligible training provider lose its eligibility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Yes. A training provider must meet the Governors requirements for eligibility and provide accurate information in order to retain its status as an eligible training provider.</P>
            <P>(b) Providers determined to have intentionally supplied inaccurate information or to have substantially violated any provision of title I of WIOA or the WIOA regulations, including 29 CFR part 38, must be removed from the State list of eligible training providers and programs in accordance with the enforcement provisions of WIOA sec. 122(f). A provider whose eligibility is terminated under these conditions must be terminated for not less than 2 years and is liable to repay all youth, adult, and dislocated worker training funds it received during the period of noncompliance. The Governor must specify in the procedures which individual or entity is responsible for making these determinations and the process by which the determination will be made, which must include an opportunity for a hearing that meets the requirements of § 683.630(b) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) As a part of the biennial review of eligibility established by the Governor, the State must remove programs of training services that fail to meet criteria established by the Governor to remain eligible, which may include failure to meet established minimum performance levels. Registered apprenticeship programs only may be removed for the reasons set forth in § 680.470.</P>
            <P>(d) The Governor must establish an appeals procedure for providers of training services to appeal a denial of eligibility under this subpart that meets the requirements of § 683.630(b) of this chapter, which explains the appeals process for denial or termination of eligibility of a provider of training services.</P>
            <P>(e) Where a Local WDB has established higher minimum performance standards, according to § 680.430(e), the Local WDB may remove a program of training services from the eligible programs in that local area for failure to meet those higher performance standards. Training providers may appeal a denial of eligibility under § 683.630(b) of this chapter.</P>

In limited circumstances, as provided in WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(h) and § 680.730, the reimbursement may be up to 75 percent of the wage rate of the participant.</P>
            <P>(b) OJT contracts under WIOA title I, must not be entered into with an employer who has received payments under previous contracts under WIOA or WIA if the employer has exhibited a pattern of failing to provide OJT participants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages and employment benefits (including health benefits) and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as other employees working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work.</P>
            <P>(c) An OJT contract must be limited to the period of time required for a participant to become proficient in the occupation for which the training is being provided. In determining the appropriate length of the contract, consideration should be given to the skill requirements of the occupation, the academic and occupational skill level of the participant, prior work experience, and the participant's IEP.</P>

            <P>The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) eliminates the requirement for Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) to establish a youth council. However, the Department encourages Local WDBs to establish a standing committee to provide information and to assist with planning, operational, oversight, and other issues relating to the provision of services to youth. If the Local WDB does not designate a standing youth committee, it retains responsibility for all aspects of youth formula programs.</P>

            <P>(a) If a Local WDB decides to form a standing youth committee, the committee must include a member of the Local WDB, who chairs the committee, members of community-based organizations with a demonstrated record of success in serving eligible youth, and other individuals with appropriate expertise and experience who are not members of the Local WDB.</P>
            <P>(b) The committee must reflect the needs of the local area. The committee members appointed for their experience and expertise may bring their expertise to help the committee address the employment, training, education, human and supportive service needs of eligible youth including out-of-school youth (OSY). Members may represent agencies such as secondary and postsecondary education, training, health, disability, mental health, housing, public assistance, and justice, or be representatives of philanthropic or economic and community development organizations, and employers. The committee may also include parents, participants, and youth.</P>
            <P>(c) A Local WDB may designate an existing entity such as an effective youth council as the standing youth committee if it fulfills the requirements above in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>In general, the applicable State law for secondary and postsecondary institutions defines “school.” However, for purposes of WIOA, the Department does not consider providers of adult education under title II of WIOA, YouthBuild programs, the Job Corps program, high school equivalency programs, or dropout re-engagement programs to be schools. Therefore, in all cases except the one provided below, WIOA youth programs may consider a youth to be an OSY for purposes of WIOA youth program eligibility if he or she attend adult education provided under title II of WIOA, YouthBuild, Job Corps, high school equivalency programs, or dropout re-engagement programs regardless of the funding source of those programs. Youth attending high school equivalency programs funded by the public K-12 school system who are classified by the school system as still enrolled in school are an exception; they are considered ISY.</P>

            <P>Local WIOA youth programs must verify a youth's dropout status at the time of WIOA youth program enrollment. An individual who is out of school at the time of enrollment, and subsequently placed in any school, is an OSY for the purposes of the 75 percent expenditure requirement for OSY throughout his/her participation in the program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Who does the low-income eligibility requirement apply to?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For OSY, only those youth who are the recipient of a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and are either basic skills deficient or an English language learner, and youth who require additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment, must be low-income. All other OSY meeting OSY eligibility under § 681.210(c)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) are not required to be low-income.</P>
            <P>(b) All ISY must be low-income to meet the ISY eligibility criteria, except those that fall under the low-income exception.</P>
            <P>(c) WIOA allows a low-income exception where five percent of WIOA youth may be participants who ordinarily would be required to be low-income for eligibility purposes and meet all other eligibility criteria for WIOA youth except the low-income criteria. A program must calculate the five percent based on the percent of newly enrolled youth in the local area's WIOA youth program in a given program year who would ordinarily be required to meet the low-income criteria.</P>

            <P>(d) In addition to the criteria in the definition of “low-income individual” in WIOA sec. 3(36), a youth is low-income if he or she receives or is eligible to receive a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 <E T="03">et seq.</E> or if he or she lives in a high poverty area.</P>

            <P>A youth who lives in a high poverty area is automatically considered to be a low-income individual. A high poverty area is a Census tract, a set of contiguous Census tracts, an American Indian Reservation, Oklahoma Tribal <PRTPAGE P="276"/>Statistical Area (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), Alaska Native Village Statistical Area or Alaska Native Regional Corporation Area, Native Hawaiian Homeland Area, or other tribal land as defined by the Secretary in guidance or county that has a poverty rate of at least 25 percent as set every 5 years using American Community Survey 5-Year data.</P>

            <P>Yes, for an individual with a disability, income level for eligibility purposes is based on the individual's own income rather than his or her family's income. WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi) states that an individual with a disability whose own income meets the low-income definition in clause (ii) (income that does not exceed the higher of the poverty line or 70 percent of the lower living standard income level), but who is a member of a family whose income exceeds this income requirement is eligible for youth services. Furthermore, only ISY with a disability must be low income. OSY with a disability are not required to be low-income.</P>

            <P>(1) The Local WDB must identify youth service providers based on criteria established in the State Plan (including such quality criteria established by the Governor for a training program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential) and take into consideration the ability of the provider to meet performance accountability measures based on the primary indicators of performance for youth programs.</P>
            <P>(2) The Local WDB must procure the youth service providers in accordance with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, in addition to applicable State and local procurement laws.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Local WDB establishes a standing youth committee under § 681.100 it may assign the committee the function of selecting of grants or contracts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Does the requirement that a State and local area expend at least 75 percent of youth funds to provide services to out-of-school youth apply to all youth funds?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes. The 75 percent requirement applies to both statewide youth activities funds and local youth funds with 2 exceptions.</P>
            <P>(a) Only statewide funds spent on direct services to youth are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. Funds spent on statewide youth activities that do not provide direct services to youth, such as most of the required statewide youth activities listed in WIOA sec. 129(b)(1), are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. For example, administrative costs, monitoring, and technical assistance are not subject to OSY expenditure requirement; while funds spent on direct services to youth such as statewide demonstration projects, are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement.</P>
            <P>(b) For a State that receives a small State minimum allotment under WIOA sec. 127(b)(1)(C)(iv)(II) for youth or WIOA sec. 132(b)(1)(B)(iv)(II) for adults, the State may submit a request to the Secretary to decrease the percentage to not less than 50 percent for a local area in the State, and the Secretary may approve such a request for that program year, if the State meets the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) After an analysis of the ISY and OSY populations in the local area, the State determines that the local area will be unable to use at least 75 percent of the local area WIOA youth funds to serve OSY due to a low number of OSY; and</P>

            <P>(2) The State submits to the Secretary, for the local area, a request including a proposed percentage decreased to not less than 50 percent to <PRTPAGE P="278"/>provide workforce investment activities for OSY.</P>
            <P>(c) In the exercise of discretion afforded by WIOA sec. 129(a)(4), the Secretary has determined that requests to decrease the percentage of funds used to provide youth workforce investment activities for OSY will not be granted to States that received 90 percent of the allotment percentage for the past year. Therefore, when the Secretary receives such a request from a State, the request will be denied.</P>
            <P>(d) For local area funds, the administrative costs of carrying out local workforce investment activities described in WIOA sec. 128(b)(4) are not subject to the OSY expenditure requirement. All other local area youth funds beyond the administrative costs are subject to the OSY expenditure requirement.</P>

            <P>(2) Develop, and update as needed, an individual service strategy based on the needs of each youth participant that is directly linked to one or more indicators of performance described in WIOA sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii), that identifies career pathways that include education and employment goals, that considers career planning and the results of the objective assessment and that prescribes achievement objectives and services for the participant; and</P>
            <P>(3) Provide case management of youth participants, including follow-up services.</P>
            <P>(b) The local plan must describe the design framework for youth programs in the local area, and how the 14 program elements required in § 681.460 are to be made available within that framework.</P>
            <P>(c) Local WDBs must ensure appropriate links to entities that will foster the participation of eligible local area youth. Such links may include connections to:</P>

            <P>(1) Providing these participants with information about the full array of applicable or appropriate services available through the Local WDBs or other eligible providers, or one-stop partners; and</P>
            <P>(2) Referring these participants to appropriate training and educational programs that have the capacity to serve them either on a sequential or concurrent basis.</P>
            <P>(e) If a youth applies for enrollment in a program of workforce investment activities and either does not meet the enrollment requirements for that program or cannot be served by that program, the eligible training provider of that program must ensure that the youth is referred for further assessment, if necessary, or referred to appropriate programs to meet the skills and training needs of the youth.</P>
            <P>(f) In order to meet the basic skills and training needs of applicants who do not meet the eligibility requirements of a particular program or who cannot be served by the program, each youth provider must ensure that these youth are referred:</P>

            <P>(h) The objective assessment required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the individual service strategy required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not required if the program provider determines that it is appropriate to use a recent objective assessment or individual service strategy that was developed under another education or training program.</P>

            <P>(3) Experiential programs that provide youth with experience in the day-to-day operation of a business. These programs may involve the development of a youth-run business that young people participating in the program work in and manage. Or, they may facilitate placement in apprentice or internship positions with adult entrepreneurs in the community.</P>

            <P>(a) Work experiences are a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate. A work experience may take place in the private for-profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act or applicable State law, exists. Consistent with § 680.840 of this chapter, funds provided for work experiences may not be used to directly or indirectly aid in the filling of a job opening that is vacant because the former occupant is on strike, or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or the filling of which is otherwise an issue in a labor dispute involving a work stoppage. Work experiences provide the youth participant with opportunities for career exploration and skill development.</P>
            <P>(b) Work experiences must include academic and occupational education. The educational component may occur concurrently or sequentially with the work experience. Further academic and occupational education may occur inside or outside the work site.</P>
            <P>(c) The types of work experiences include the following categories:</P>
            <P>(1) Summer employment opportunities and other employment opportunities available throughout the school year;</P>

            <P>No, WIOA does not require Local WDBs to offer summer youth employment opportunities as summer employment is no longer its own program element under WIOA.

            <P>(a) For funding authorized by secs. 128(b)(2), 133(b)(2)(A), and 133(b)(2)(B) of WIOA, which are youth, adult, and dislocated worker funds, a local area must not receive an allocation percentage for a fiscal year that is less than 90 percent of the average allocation percentage of the local area for the 2 preceding fiscal years.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department's annual fiscal year appropriation provides funding for programs and activities described in paragraph (a) of this section under separate appropriations with various periods of availability. These periods of availability are described in § 683.100 as a program year. A program year for funds allocated under secs. 133(b)(2)(A) and 133(b)(2)(B) of WIOA begins on July 1 in the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made and ends on June 30 of the following year. A program year for funds available under WIOA sec. 128(b)(2) is available from April 1 of the fiscal year in which the appropriation is made and ends on June 30 of the following year. Therefore, when grantees are calculating the minimum funding percentage they must do so on a program year basis.</P>
            <P>(c) When a new local area is designated under sec. 106 of WIOA the State must develop a methodology to apply the minimum funding provision specified in paragraph (a) of this section to local area allocations of WIOA youth, adult, and dislocated worker funds.</P>

The amount to be recaptured from each State for reallotment, if any, is based on State obligations of the funds allotted to each State under secs. 127 and 132 of WIOA for programs serving youth, adults, or dislocated workers, less any amount reserved (up to five percent at the State level) for the costs of administration. The recapture amount, if any, is separately determined for each funding stream.</P>
            <P>(b) The Secretary reallots youth, adult and dislocated worker funds among eligible States in accordance with the provisions of secs. 127(c) and 132(c) of WIOA, respectively.

If the Governor chooses to reallocate funds, the provisions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply.</P>
            <P>(b) For the youth, adult and dislocated worker programs, the amount to be recaptured from each local area for purposes of reallocation, if any, must be based on the amount by which the prior year's unobligated balance of allocated funds exceeds 20 percent of that year's allocation for the program, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration. Unobligated balances must be determined based on allocations adjusted for any allowable transfer between funding streams. The amount to be recaptured, if any, must be separately determined for each funding stream. The term “obligation” is defined at 2 CFR 200.71.</P>
            <P>(c) To be eligible to receive youth, adult or dislocated worker funds under the reallocation procedures, a local area must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior program year's allocation, less any amount reserved (up to 10 percent) for the costs of administration, for youth, adult, or dislocated worker activities, as separately determined.

            <P>(2) Unless specified in the grant agreement, for those items requiring prior approval in the Uniform Guidance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> selected items of cost, budget realignment), the authority to grant or deny approval is delegated to the Governor for programs funded under sec. 127 or 132 of WIOA or under the Wagner-Peyser Act.</P>
            <P>(3) Costs of workforce councils, advisory councils, Native American Employment and Training Councils, and Local WDB committees established under title I of WIOA are allowable.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Uniform administrative requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) through (6) of this section, all recipients and subrecipients of a Federal award under title I of WIOA and under the Wagner-Peyser Act must follow 2 CFR part 200, including any exceptions identified by the Department at 2 CFR part 2900.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Government-wide debarment and suspension, and government-wide drug-free workplace requirements.</E> All WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser Act grant recipients and subrecipients must comply with the government-wide requirements for debarment and suspension, and the government-wide requirements for a drug-free workplace in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, 41 U.S.C. 8103 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and 2 CFR part 182.</P>

            <P>Yes, under 38 U.S.C. 4213, when past income is an eligibility determinant for Federal employment or training programs, any amounts received as military pay or allowances by any person who served on active duty, and certain other specified benefits must be disregarded for the veteran and for other individuals for whom those amounts would normally be applied in making an eligibility determination. This applies when determining if a person is a “low-income individual” for eligibility purposes (for example, in the WIOA youth, or NFJP programs). Also, it applies when income is used as a factor when a local area provides priority of service for “low-income individuals” <PRTPAGE P="306"/>with title I WIOA funds (<E T="03">see</E> §§ 680.600 and 680.650 of this chapter).

            <P>(b) 29 CFR part 2, subpart D, governs the circumstances under which Department support, including WIOA title I financial assistance, may be used to employ or train participants in religious activities. Under that subpart, such assistance may be used for such employment or training only when the assistance is provided indirectly within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and not when the assistance is provided directly. That subpart also contains requirements related to equal treatment in Department of Labor programs for religious organizations, and to protecting the religious liberty of Department of Labor social service providers and beneficiaries. (29 CFR part 2, subpart D—Equal Treatment in Department of Labor Programs for Religious Organizations, Protection of Religious Liberty of Department of Labor Social Service Providers and Beneficiaries).</P>

            <P>(b) In instances where funds awarded under title I of WIOA or the Wagner-Peyser Act pay only a portion of the salary or bonus, the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyser Act funds may only be charged for the share of the employee's salary or bonus attributable to the work performed on the WIOA title I or Wagner-Peyser Act grant. That portion cannot exceed the proportional Executive level II rate. The restriction applies to the sum of salaries and bonuses charged as either direct costs or indirect costs under title I of WIOA and the Wagner-Peyser Act.</P>
            <P>(c) The limitation described in paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to contractors (as defined in 2 CFR 200.23) providing goods and services. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.330, characteristics indicative of contractor are the following:</P>

            <P>(a) As a result of an investigation, on-site visit, other monitoring, or an audit (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Single Audit, OIG Audit, GAO Audit, or other audit), the Secretary will notify the direct recipient of the Federal award of the findings of the investigation and give the direct recipient a period of time (not more than 60 days) to comment and to take appropriate corrective actions.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Adequate resolution.</E> The Grant Officer in conjunction with the Federal project officer, reviews the complete file of the monitoring review, monitoring report, or final audit report and the recipient's response and actions under paragraph (a) of this section. The Grant Officer's review takes into account the sanction provisions of secs. 184(b)-(c) of WIOA.

            <SUBJECT>What is the Grant Officer resolution process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When the Grant Officer is dissatisfied with the a recipient's disposition of an audit or other resolution of findings (including those arising out of site visits, incident reports or compliance reviews), or with the recipient's response to findings resulting from investigations or monitoring reports, the initial and final determination process as set forth in this section is used to resolve the matter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The Grant Officer makes an initial determination on the findings for both those matters where there is agreement and those where there is disagreement with the recipient's resolution, including the allowability of questioned costs or activities. This initial determination is based upon the requirements of WIOA, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and applicable regulations, and the terms and conditions of the grants or other agreements under the award.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Informal resolution.</E> Except in an emergency situation, when the Secretary invokes the authority described in sec. 184(e) of WIOA, the Grant Officer may not revoke a recipient's grant in whole or in part, nor institute corrective actions or sanctions, without first providing the recipient with an opportunity to present documentation or arguments to resolve informally those matters in dispute contained in the initial determination. The initial determination must provide for an informal resolution period of at least 60 days from issuance of the initial determination. If the matters are resolved informally, the Grant Officer must issue a final determination under paragraph (d) of this section which notifies <PRTPAGE P="315"/>the parties in writing of the nature of the resolution and may close the file.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> (1) Upon completion of the informal resolution process, the Grant Officer provides each party with a written final determination by certified mail, return receipt requested. For audits of recipient-level entities and other recipients which receive WIOA funds directly from the Department, ordinarily, the final determination is issued not later than 180 days from the date that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) issues the final approved audit report to the Employment and Training Administration. For audits of subrecipients conducted by the OIG, ordinarily the final determination is issued not later than 360 days from the date the OIG issues the final approved audit report to ETA.</P>
            <P>(2) A final determination under this paragraph (d) must:</P>
            <P>(i) Indicate whether efforts to resolve informally matters contained in the initial determination have been unsuccessful;</P>
            <P>(ii) List those matters upon which the parties continue to disagree;</P>
            <P>(iii) List any modifications to the factual findings and conclusions set forth in the initial determination and the rationale for such modifications;</P>
            <P>(iv) Establish a debt, if appropriate;</P>
            <P>(v) Require corrective action, when needed;</P>
            <P>(vi) Determine liability, method of restitution of funds, and sanctions; and</P>

            <P>(1) It is a strategy to use WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts as they are described in § 683.510;</P>
            <P>(2) It must include the identification of the workforce development problem and target populations for which a local area will pursue a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy; the outcomes the local area would hope to achieve through a Pay-for-Performance contract relative to baseline performance; and the acceptable cost to government associated with achieving these outcomes;</P>
            <P>(3) It must include a strategy for independently validating the performance outcomes achieved under each contract within the strategy prior to payment occurring; and</P>
            <P>(4) It must include a description of how the State or local area will reallocate funds to other activities under the contract strategy in the event a service provider does not achieve performance benchmarks under a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to the implementation of a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy, a local area must conduct a feasibility study to determine whether the intervention is suitable for a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy.</P>
            <P>(c) The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy must be developed in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary.</P>

            <P>(b) In grant selection appeals of awards funded under WIOA title I, subtitle D:</P>
            <P>(1) If the Administrative Law Judge rules, under § 683.800, that the appealing organization should have been selected for an award, the matter must be remanded to the Grant Officer. The Grant Officer must, within 10 working days, determine whether the organization continues to meet the requirements of the applicable solicitation, whether the funds which are the subject of the ALJ's decision will be awarded to the organization, and the timing of the award. In making this determination, the Grant Officer must take into account disruption to participants, disruption to grantees, and the operational needs of the program.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Administrative Law Judge rules that additional application review is required, the Grant Officer must implement that review and, if a new organization is selected, follow the steps laid out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine whether the grant funds will be awarded to that organization.</P>
            <P>(3) In the event that the Grant Officer determines that the funds will not be awarded to the appealing organization for the reasons discussed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an organization which does not have an approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement will be awarded its reasonable application preparation costs.</P>
            <P>(4) If funds are awarded to the appealing organization, the Grant Officer will notify the current grantee within 10 days. In addition, the appealing organization is not entitled to the full grant amount but only will receive the funds remaining in the grant that have not been obligated by the current grantee through its operation of the grant and its subsequent closeout.</P>

            <P>(5) In the event that an organization, other than the appealing organization, <PRTPAGE P="325"/>is adversely effected by the Grant Officer's determination upon completion of the additional application review under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that organization may appeal that decision to the Office of Administrative Law Judges by following the procedures set forth in § 683.800.</P>
            <P>(6) Any organization selected and/or funded under WIOA title I, subtitle D, is subject to having its award removed if an ALJ decision so orders. As part of this process, the Grant Officer will provide instructions on transition and closeout to both the newly selected grantee and to the grantee whose position is affected or which is being removed. All awardees must agree to the provisions of this paragraph (b) as a condition of accepting a grant award.</P>

            <P>(a) The ALJ should render a written decision not later than 90 days after the closing of the record.</P>
            <P>(b) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 20 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 02-2012), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law or policy to which exception is taken. Any exception not specifically raised in the petition is deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition for review also must be sent to the opposing party and if an applicant or recipient, to the Grant Officer and the Grant Officer's Counsel at the time of filing. Unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, notifies the parties that the case has been accepted for review, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action. Any case accepted by the ARB must be decided within 180 days of acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>When will the Administrative Law Judge issue a decision?</SUBJECT>
                  <STARS/>
                  <P>(b) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 20 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 01-2020), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exception is taken. Any exception not specifically raised in the petition is deemed to have been waived. A copy of the petition for review also must be sent to the opposing party and if an applicant or recipient, to the Grant Officer and the Grant Officer's Counsel at the time of filing. Unless the ARB, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, notifies the parties that the case has been accepted for review, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action. In any case accepted by the ARB, a decision must be issued by the ARB within 180 days of acceptance. If a decision is not so issued, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that may be used in place of an Office of Administrative Law Judges hearing?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The parties to a complaint which has been filed according to the requirements of § 683.800 may choose to waive their rights to an administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to transfer the settlement of their dispute to an individual acceptable to all parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts and render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written decision must be issued within 60 days after submission of the matter for informal review.</P>
            <P>(b) The waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ described in paragraph (a) of this section will automatically be revoked if a settlement has not been reached or a written decision has not been issued within the 60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will be treated as a final decision of an Administrative Law Judge under WIOA sec. 186(b).</P>

            <P>(a) Any party to a proceeding which resulted in a Secretary's final order under WIOA sec. 186 in which the Secretary awards, declines to award, or only conditionally awards financial assistance or with respect to a corrective action or sanction imposed under WIOA sec. 184 may obtain a review in the United States Court of Appeals having jurisdiction over the applicant or recipient of funds involved, by filing a review petition within 30 days of the issuance of the Secretary's final order in accordance with WIOA sec. 187.</P>
            <P>(b) The court has jurisdiction to make and enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the Secretary, in whole or in part.</P>
            <P>(c) No objection to the Secretary's order may be considered by the court unless the objection was specifically urged, in a timely manner, before the Secretary. The review is limited to questions of law, and the findings of fact of the Secretary are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</P>

            <P>(a) The purpose of WIOA Indian and Native American (INA) programs in sec. 166 is to support employment and training activities for INAs in order to:</P>
            <P>(1) Develop more fully the academic, occupational, and literacy skills of such individuals;</P>
            <P>(2) Make such individuals more competitive in the workforce and to equip them with entrepreneurial skills necessary for successful self-employment; and</P>

            <P>(3) Promote the economic and social development of INA communities in <PRTPAGE P="328"/>accordance with the goals and values of such communities.</P>

            <P>(b) The principal means of accomplishing these purposes is to enable tribes and Native American organizations to provide employment and training services to INAs and their communities. Services should be provided in a culturally appropriate manner, consistent with the principles of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

            <P>(a) INA programs will be administered to maximize the Federal commitment to support the growth and development of INAs and their communities as determined by representatives of such communities.</P>
            <P>(b) In administering these programs, the Department will follow the Congressional declaration of policy set forth in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, at 25 U.S.C. 450a, as well as the Department of Labor's “American Indian and Alaska Native Policies.”</P>
            <P>(c) The regulations in this part are not intended to abrogate the trust responsibilities of the Federal government to Federally recognized tribes in any way.</P>
            <P>(d) The Department will administer INA programs through a single organizational unit and consistent with the requirements in sec. 166(i) of WIOA. The Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) within the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is designated as this single organizational unit as required by sec. 166(i)(1) of WIOA.</P>
            <P>(e) The Department will establish and maintain administrative procedures for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of INA employment and training programs authorized under this Act.</P>

In addition, the Department will consult with the INA program grantee community in developing policies for the INA programs, actively seeking and considering the views of INA program grantees prior to establishing INA program policies and regulations. The Department will follow the Department of Labor's tribal consultation policy and Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the requirements to apply for a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be eligible to apply for a WIOA, sec. 166 grant, an entity must have legal status as a government or as an agency of a government, private non-profit corporation, or a consortium whose members all qualify as one of these entities.</P>
            <P>(b) A new entity (which is not an incumbent grantee) must have a population within the designated geographic service area which would receive at least $100,000 under the funding formula found at § 684.270(b), including any amounts received for supplemental youth services under the funding formula at § 684.440(a).</P>
            <P>(c) Incumbent grantees which do not meet this dollar threshold and were receiving INA funding of less than $100,000 as of October 18, 2016 will be grandfathered into the program and are eligible to be awarded less than $100,000 so long as the grantees have continuously received less than $100,000 since October 18, 2016.</P>

            <P>(d) The Department will make an exception to the $100,000 minimum for applicants that apply for WIOA funding through Public Law 102-477, the Indian, Employment, Training, and Related Services demonstration program, if all resources to be consolidated under the <PRTPAGE P="330"/>Public Law 102-477 plan total at least $100,000, with at least $20,000 derived from sec. 166 funds. However, incumbent Public Law 102-477 grantees that were receiving INA funding of less than $20,000 as of October 18, 2016 will be grandfathered into the program and are eligible to be awarded less than $20,000 so long as the grantees have continuously received less than $20,000 since October 18, 2016.</P>
            <P>(e) To be eligible to apply as a consortium, each member of the consortium must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be in close proximity to one another, but may operate in more than one State;</P>
            <P>(2) Have an administrative unit legally authorized to run the program and to commit the other members to contracts, grants, and other legally-binding agreements; and</P>
            <P>(3) Be jointly and individually responsible for the actions and obligations of the consortium, including debts.</P>
            <P>(f) Entities eligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:</P>
            <P>(1) Federally recognized Indian tribes;</P>
            <P>(2) Tribal organizations, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 450b;</P>
            <P>(3) Alaska Native-controlled organizations;</P>
            <P>(4) Native Hawaiian-controlled organizations;</P>
            <P>(5) Indian-controlled organizations serving INAs; and</P>
            <P>(6) A consortium of eligible entities which meets the legal requirements for a consortium described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) State-recognized tribal organizations that meet the definition of an Indian-controlled organization are eligible to apply for WIOA sec. 166 grant funds. State-recognized tribes that do not meet this definition but were grantees under WIA as of July 1, 2015 will be grandfathered into WIOA as Indian-controlled organizations provided they meet the definition of Indian-controlled organization in § 684.130.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What priority for awarding grants is given to eligible organizations?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Federally recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native entities, or a consortium of such entities will have priority to receive grants under this part for those geographic service areas in which they have legal jurisdiction, such as an Indian reservation, Oklahoma Tribal Service Area (OTSA), or Alaska Native Village Service Area (ANVSA).</P>
            <P>(b) If the Department decides not to make an award to an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity that has legal jurisdiction over a service area, it will consult with such tribe or Alaska Native entity that has jurisdiction before selecting another entity to provide services for such areas.</P>
            <P>(c) The priority described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply to service areas outside the legal jurisdiction of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native entity.</P>

            <P>(a) Entities seeking a WIOA sec. 166 grant, including incumbent grantees, will be provided an opportunity to apply for a WIOA sec. 166 grant every 4 years through a competitive grant process.</P>
            <P>(b) As part of the competitive application process, applicants will be required to submit a 4-year plan as described at § 684.710. The requirement to submit a 4-year plan does not apply to entities that have been granted approval to transfer their WIOA funds to the Department of the Interior pursuant to Public Law 102-477.</P>

            <P>Any entity that is denied a grant award for which it applied in whole or in part may appeal the denial to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges using the procedures at § 683.800 of this chapter or the alternative dispute resolution procedures at § 683.840 of this chapter.

            <SUBJECT>Are there any other ways in which an entity may be awarded a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grant?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes. For areas that would otherwise go unserved, the Grant Officer may designate an entity, which has not submitted a competitive application, but which meets the qualifications for a grant award, to serve the particular geographic area. Under such circumstances, DINAP will seek the views of INA leaders in the community that would otherwise go unserved before making the decision to designate the entity that would serve the community. DINAP will inform the Grant Officer of the INA leaders' views. The Grant Officer will accommodate views of INA leaders in such areas to the extent possible.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Can an Indian and Native American grantee's grant award be terminated?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Yes, the Grant Officer can terminate a grantee's award for cause, or the Secretary or another Department of Labor official confirmed by the Senate can terminate a grantee's award in emergency circumstances where termination is necessary to protect the integrity of Federal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program under sec. 184(e) of WIOA.</P>
            <P>(b) The Grant Officer may terminate a grantee's award for cause only if there is a substantial or persistent violation of the requirements in WIOA or the WIOA regulations. The grantee must be provided with written notice 60 days before termination, stating the specific reasons why termination is proposed. The appeal procedures at § 683.800 of this chapter apply.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Does the Department have to award a grant for every part of the country?</SUBJECT>
            <P>No, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for a grant award in a particular area, or willing to serve that area, the Department will not award funds for that service area. The funds that otherwise would have been allocated to that area under § 684.270 will be distributed to other INA program grantees, or used for other program purposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). Unawarded funds used for TAT are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under § 684.270(e). Areas which are unserved by the INA program may be restored during a subsequent grant award cycle, when and if a current grantee or other eligible entity applies for a grant award to serve that area.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 684.270</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How are Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds allocated to Indian and Native American program grantees?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except for reserved funds described in paragraph (e) of this section and funds used for other program purposes under § 684.260, all funds available for WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) comprehensive workforce investment services program at the beginning of a program year will be allocated to INA program grantees for the geographic service area(s) awarded to them through the grant competition.</P>
            <P>(b) Each INA program grantee will receive the sum of the funds calculated using the following formula:</P>
            <P>(1) One-quarter of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of unemployed American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals in the grantee's geographic service area(s) compared to all such unemployed persons in the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) Three-quarters of the funds available will be allocated on the basis of the number of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals in poverty in the grantee's geographic service area(s) as compared to all such persons in poverty in the United States.</P>
            <P>(3) The data and definitions used to implement these formulas are provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</P>

            <P>(c) In years immediately following the use of new data in the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section, based upon criteria to be described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the Department may utilize a hold harmless factor to reduce the disruption in grantee services which would otherwise result from <PRTPAGE P="332"/>changes in funding levels. This factor will be determined in consultation with the grantee community and the Native American Employment and Training Council.</P>
            <P>(d) The Department may reallocate funds from one INA program grantee to another if a grantee is unable to serve its area for any reason, such as audit or debt problems, criminal activity, internal (political) strife, failure to adhere to or meet grant terms and conditions, or lack of ability or interest. If a grantee has excess carry-in for a program year, the Department also may readjust the awards granted under the funding formula so that an amount that equals the previous program year's carry-in will be allocated to another INA program grantee(s).</P>
            <P>(e) The Department may reserve up to one percent of the funds appropriated under WIOA sec. 166(d)(2)(A)(i) for any program year for TAT purposes. It will consult with the Native American Employment and Training Council in planning how the TAT funds will be used, designating activities to meet the unique needs of the INA communities served by the INA program. INA program grantees also will have access to resources available to other Department programs to the extent permitted under other law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the role of Indian and Native American program grantees in the one-stop delivery system?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In those local areas where an INA program grantee conducts field operations or provides substantial services, the INA program grantee is a required partner in the local one-stop delivery system and is subject to the provisions relating to such partners described in part 678 of this chapter. Consistent with those provisions, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the INA program grantee and the Local Workforce Development Board (WDB) over the operation of the one-stop center(s) in the Local WDB's workforce development area also must be executed. Where the Local WDB is an alternative entity under § 679.150 of this chapter, the INA program grantee must negotiate with the alternative entity on the terms of its MOU and the scope of its on-going role in the local workforce development system, as specified in §§ 678.420 and 678.500 through 678.510 of this chapter. In local areas with a large concentration of potentially eligible INA participants, which are in an INA program grantee's service area but in which the grantee does not conduct operations or provide substantial services, the INA program grantee should encourage such individuals to participate in the one-stop delivery system in that area in order to receive WIOA services.</P>
            <P>(b) At a minimum, the MOU must contain the provisions listed in WIOA sec. 121(c) and:</P>
            <P>(1) The exchange of information on the services available and accessible through the one-stop delivery system and the INA program;</P>
            <P>(2) As necessary to provide referrals and case management services, the exchange of information on INA participants in the one-stop delivery system and the INA program; and</P>
            <P>(3) Arrangements for the funding of services provided by the one-stop(s), consistent with the requirements that no expenditures may be made with INA program funds for individuals who are not eligible or for services not authorized under this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Where the INA program grantee has failed to enter into a MOU with the Local WDB, the INA program grantee must describe in its 4-year plan the good-faith efforts made in order to negotiate an MOU with the Local WDB.</P>
            <P>(d) Pursuant to WIOA sec. 121(h)(2)(D)(iv), INA program grantees will not be subject to the funding of the one-stop infrastructure unless otherwise agreed upon in the MOU under subpart C of part 678 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) INA program grantees may pay training allowances or stipends to participants for their successful participation in and completion of education or training services (except such allowance may not be provided to participants in OJT). Allowances or stipends may not exceed the Federal or State minimum wage, whichever is higher.</P>
            <P>(b) INA program grantees may not pay a participant in a training activity when the person fails to participate without good cause.</P>
            <P>(c) If a participant in a WIOA-funded activity, including participants in OJT, is involved in an employer-employee relationship, that participant must be paid wages and fringe benefits at the same rates as trainees or employees who have similar training, experience and skills and which are not less than the higher of the applicable Federal, State, or local minimum wage.</P>
            <P>(d) In accordance with the policy described in the 4-year plan submitted as part of the competitive process, INA program grantees may pay incentive bonuses to participants who meet or exceed individual employability or training goals established in writing in the individual employment plan.</P>
            <P>(e) INA program grantees must comply with other restrictions listed in WIOA secs. 181 through 195, which apply to all programs funded under title I of WIOA, including the provisions on labor standards in WIOA sec. 181(b).</P>

            <P>Applicants eligible to apply for supplemental youth funding must describe the supplemental youth services they intend to provide in the 4-year plan that they will submit as part of the competitive application process. The information on youth services will be incorporated into the overall 4-year plan, which is more fully described in §§ 684.700 and 684.710, and is required for both adult and youth funds. As indicated in § 684.710(c), additional planning information required for applicants requesting supplemental youth funding will be provided in the FOA. The Department envisions that the strategy for youth funds will not be extensive; however, grantees will be required to provide the number of youth it plans to serve and projected performance outcomes. The Department also supports youth activities that preserve INA culture and will support strategies that promote INA values.</P>

            <P>(1) Any rebate, discount, or similar incentive provided by a vendor to its customers as a regular feature of its business; and</P>
            <P>(2) Items of nominal monetary value distributed consistent with the cultural practices of the INA community served by the grantee.</P>
            <P>(d) No person who selects program participants or authorizes the services provided to them may select or authorize services to any participant who is such a person's spouse, parent, sibling, or child unless:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) The participant involved is a low-income individual; or</P>

WIOA funds consolidated under Public Law 102-477 are administered by Department of the Interior (DOI). Accordingly, the administrative oversight for funds transferred to DOI, including the reporting of financial expenditures and program outcomes are the responsibility of DOI. However, the Department must review the initial 477 plan and ensure that all Departmental programmatic and financial obligations have been met before WIOA funds are approved to be transferred to DOI and consolidated with other related programs. The initial plan must meet the statutory requirements of WIOA. After approval of the initial plan, all subsequent plans that are renewed or updated from the initial plan may be approved by DOI without further review by the Department.</P>

            <P>(b) Eligible applicants are assigned to the center that offers the type of career technical training selected by the individual, and among the centers that offer such career technical training, is closest to the home of the individual. The Secretary may waive this requirement if:</P>

            <P>(1) The enrollee would be unduly delayed in participating in the Job Corps program because the closest center is operating at full capacity; or<PRTPAGE P="364"/>

          <P>There are two types and purposes of National Dislocated Worker Grants (DWGs) under sec. 170 of WIOA: Employment Recovery DWGs and Disaster Recovery DWGs.</P>
          <P>(a) Employment Recovery DWGs provide employment and training activities for dislocated workers and other eligible populations. They are intended to expand service capacity temporarily at the State and local levels, by providing time-limited funding assistance in response to major economic dislocations or other events that affect the U.S. workforce that cannot be accommodated with WIOA formula funds or other relevant existing resources.</P>
          <P>(b) Disaster Recovery DWGs allow for the creation of disaster relief employment to assist with clean-up and recovery efforts from emergencies or major disasters and the provision of employment and training activities, in accordance with § 687.180(b).</P>

          <SUBJECT>What are the allowable activities under National Dislocated Worker Grants?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For Employment Recovery DWGs:</P>
          <P>(1) Employment and training assistance, including those activities authorized at secs. 134(c) through (d) and 170(b)(1) of WIOA. The services to be provided in a particular project are negotiated between the Department and the grantee, taking into account the needs of the target population covered by the grant, and may be changed through grant modifications, if necessary.</P>
          <P>(2) DWGs may provide for supportive services, including needs-related payments (subject to the restrictions in sec. 134(d)(3) of WIOA, where applicable, and the terms and conditions of the grant) to help workers who require such assistance to participate in the activities provided for in the grant. Generally, the terms of a grant must be consistent with local policies governing such financial assistance under its formula funds (including the payment levels and duration of payments). The terms of the grant agreement may diverge from established local policies, in the following instances:</P>
          <P>(i) If unemployed dislocated workers served by the project are not able to meet the 13 or 8 weeks enrollment in training requirement established by sec. 134(d)(3)(B) of WIOA because of the lack of formula or DWG funds in the State or local area at the time of the dislocation, such individuals may be eligible for needs-related payments if they are enrolled in training by the end of the 6th week following the date of the DWG award; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Under other circumstances as specified in guidance governing DWG application requirements.</P>
          <P>(b) For Disaster DWGs: Funds provided under sec. 170(b)(1)(B) of WIOA can support a different array of activities, depending on the circumstances surrounding the situation for which the grant was awarded:</P>

          <P>(1) For DWGs serving individuals in an emergency or disaster area declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA, disaster relief employment is authorized to support projects that provide food, clothing, shelter, and other humanitarian assistance for emergency and disaster victims, and projects regarding demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation, and reconstruction of damaged and destroyed structures, facilities, and lands located within the disaster area and in offshore areas related to the emergency or disaster in coordination with the Administrator of FEMA. Employment and training activities also may be provided, as appropriate. An individual's disaster relief employment is limited to 12 months or less for work related to recovery from <PRTPAGE P="382"/>a single emergency or disaster. The Secretary may extend an individual's disaster relief employment for up to an additional 12 months, if it is requested and sufficiently justified by an entity described in § 687.120(b).</P>
          <P>(2) For DWGs serving individuals who have relocated from an emergency or disaster area, only employment and training activities will be authorized, except where disaster relief employment is appropriate.</P>
          <P>(3) For DWGs awarded to States for events that have designations from Federal agencies (other than FEMA) that recognize an emergency or disaster situation as one of national significance that could result in a potentially large loss of employment, disaster relief employment and/or employment and training activities may be authorized, depending on the circumstances associated with the specific event.</P>
          <P>(c) Disaster Recovery DWG funds may be expended through public and private agencies and organizations engaged in the activities described in this paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>How do statutory and regulatory waivers apply to National Dislocated Worker Grants?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For DWGs, utilization of statutory or regulatory waivers is limited to waivers already approved by the Department under sec. 189(i) of WIOA, separate from the DWG process. WIOA sec. 189(i) gives the Department the authority to waive provisions under subtitles A, B, and/or E of WIOA; requirements of DWGs in WIOA subtitle D cannot and will not be waived.</P>
          <P>(b) A grant application must include a description of the approved waiver and request that the waiver be applied to the DWG. The Department will consider such requests as part of the overall DWG application review and decision process; however, applicants may not use this process to request new waivers.</P>
          <P>(c) If during the operation of a DWG, the grantee wishes to utilize a statutory or regulatory waiver that the Department has already approved under sec. 189(i), but it was not included in the grantee's original DWG application, the grantee must submit a grant modification that describes the waiver and requests application of the waiver to the DWG. Grantees may not use this process to request new waivers.</P>

          <SUBJECT>What are the program and administrative requirements that apply to National Dislocated Worker Grants?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Unless otherwise authorized in a DWG agreement, the financial and administrative rules contained in part 683 of this chapter apply to awards under this part.</P>
          <P>(b) Exceptions include:</P>
          <P>(1) Funds provided in response to a disaster may be used for temporary job creation in areas declared eligible for public assistance by FEMA, and, in some instances, areas impacted by an emergency or disaster situation of national significance, as provided in § 687.110(b)(2), and subject to the limitations of sec. 170(d) of WIOA, this part, and any guidance issued by the Department;</P>
          <P>(2) Per sec. 170(d)(4) of WIOA, in extremely limited instances, as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, any Disaster Recovery DWG funds that are available for expenditure under any grant awarded under this part may be used for additional disasters or situations of national significance experienced by an entity described in § 687.120(b) in the same program year the funds were awarded;</P>
          <P>(3) DWG funds may be used to pay an appropriate level of administrative costs based on the design and complexity of the project. The Department will negotiate administrative costs with the applicant as part of the application review and grant award and modification processes. Administrative cost limits will be calculated against the amount of the grant awarded;</P>
          <P>(4) The period of availability for expenditure of funds under a DWG is specified in the grant agreement;</P>
          <P>(5) The Department may establish supplemental reporting, monitoring, and oversight requirements for DWGs. The requirements will be identified in the grant application instructions or the grant document; and</P>

          <P>(6) The Department may negotiate and fund projects under terms other <PRTPAGE P="383"/>than those specified in this part where it can be clearly demonstrated that such adjustments will achieve a greater positive benefit for the workers and/or communities being assisted.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is YouthBuild?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) YouthBuild is a workforce development program that provides employment, education, leadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged and low-income youth between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom are secondary school drop outs and are either a member of a low-income family, a foster care youth, a youth who is homeless, an offender, a youth with a disability, a child of an <PRTPAGE P="384"/>incarcerated parent, or a migrant youth.</P>
            <P>(b) Program participants receive education services that may lead to either a high school diploma or its State-recognized equivalent. Further, they receive occupational skills training and are encouraged to pursue postsecondary education or additional training, including registered apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. The program is designed to create a skilled workforce either in the construction industry, through the rehabilitation and construction of housing for homeless and low-income individuals and families, as well as public facilities, or in other in-demand industries or occupations. The program also benefits the larger community because it provides increased access to affordable housing.</P>

The income test will be conducted only at the time of entry for each available unit or rehabilitation of occupant-owned home. If the grantee cannot find a qualifying tenant to lease the unit, the unit may be leased to a family whose income is above the income threshold to qualify as a low-income family but below the median income for the area. Leases for tenants with higher incomes will be limited to not more than 2 years.

The term of the restrictive covenant must be at least 5 years from the time of the issuance of the occupancy permit, unless a time period of more than 5 years has been established by the grantee. The Department advises that any additional stipulations imposed by a grantee or property owner be clearly stated in the covenant.</P>
            <P>(e) Any conveyance document prepared in the 5-year period of the restrictive covenant must inform the buyer of the property that all residential housing units constructed or rehabilitated using YouthBuild funds are subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) This subchapter contains the regulations governing the administration of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as amended (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. 901 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> except activities, pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 941, assigned to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health. It also contains the regulations governing the administration of the direct extensions of the LHWCA: the Defense Base Act (DBA), 42 U.S.C. 1651 <E T="03">et seq.;</E> the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), 43 U.S.C. 1331; and the Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act (NFIA), 5 U.S.C. 8171 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(b) The regulations in this subchapter also apply to claims filed under the District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act (DCCA), 36 D.C. Code 501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> That law applies to all claims for injuries or deaths based on employment events that occurred prior to July 26, 1982, the effective date of the District of Columbia Workers' Compensation Act, as amended (D.C. Code 32-1501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

              <P>Part 701 provides a general description of the regulations in this subchapter; sets forth information regarding the persons and agencies within the Department of Labor authorized by the Secretary of Labor to administer the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, its extensions and the regulations in this subchapter; and defines and clarifies use of specific terms in the several parts of this subchapter. Part 702 of this subchapter contains the general administrative regulations governing claims filed under the LHWCA. Part 703 of this subchapter <PRTPAGE P="404"/>contains the regulations governing insurance carrier authorizations, insurance carrier security deposits, self-insurer authorizations, and certificates of compliance with the insurance regulations, as required by sections 32 and 37 of the LHWCA (33 U.S.C. 932, 937). Because the extensions of the LHWCA (<E T="03">see</E> § 701.101) incorporate by reference nearly all the provisions of the LHWCA, the regulations in parts 701, 702 and 703 also apply to the administration of the extensions (DBA, DCCA, OCSLA, and NFIA), unless otherwise noted. Part 704 of this subchapter contains the exceptions to the general applicability of parts 702 and 703 for the DBA, the DCCA, the OCSLA, and the NFIA.</P>

              <P>(a) Exclusions from the definition of “employee” under § 701.301(a)(12), and the employees of small vessel facilities <PRTPAGE P="406"/>otherwise covered which are exempted from coverage under § 702.171, are dependent upon coverage under a state workers' compensation program. For these purposes, a worker or dependent must first claim compensation under the appropriate state program and receive a final decision on the merits of the claim, denying coverage, before any claim may be filed under this Act.</P>
              <P>(b) The intent of the Act is that state law will apply to those categories of employees if it otherwise would. Accordingly, not withstanding any contrary state law, claims by any of the categories of workers excluded under § 701.301 or 702.171 must be made to and processed by the state and a merit decision denying coverage on jurisdictional grounds must be made before coverage or benefits under the Act may be sought.</P>
              <P>(c) The time for filing notice and claim under the Act (see subpart B of part 702) does not begin to run for purposes of claims by those workers or dependents described in § 701.301(a)(12) and § 702.171, until a final adverse decision denying coverage under a state compensation act is received.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is a recreational vessel?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recreational vessel</E> means a vessel—</P>
              <P>(1) Being manufactured or operated primarily for pleasure; or</P>
              <P>(2) Leased, rented, or chartered to another for the latter's pleasure.</P>
              <P>(b) In applying the definition in paragraph (a) of this section, the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(1) A vessel being <E T="03">manufactured</E> or <E T="03">built,</E> or being repaired under warranty by its manufacturer or builder, is a <E T="03">recreational vessel</E> if the vessel appears intended, based on its design and construction, to be for ultimate recreational uses. The manufacturer or builder bears the burden of establishing that a vessel is recreational under this standard.</P>
              <P>(2) A vessel being <E T="03">repaired, dismantled for repair,</E> or <E T="03">dismantled at the end of its life</E> is not a <E T="03">recreational vessel</E> if the vessel had been operating, around the time of its repair or dismantling, in one or more of the following categories on more than an infrequent basis—</P>
              <P>(A) “Passenger vessel” as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(22);</P>
              <P>(B) “Small passenger vessel” as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(35);</P>
              <P>(C) “Uninspected passenger vessel” as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(42);</P>
              <P>(D) Vessel routinely engaged in “commercial service” as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(5); or</P>
              <P>(E) Vessel that routinely carries “passengers for hire” as defined by 46 U.S.C. 2101(21a).</P>

              <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a vessel will be deemed recreational if it is a <E T="03">public vessel, i.e.,</E> a vessel owned or bareboat-chartered and operated by the United States, or by a State or political subdivision thereof, at the time of repair, dismantling for repair, or dismantling, provided that such vessel shares elements of design and construction with traditional recreational vessels and is not normally engaged in a military, commercial or traditionally commercial undertaking.</P>
              <P>(c) All subsequent amendments to the statutes referenced in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the regulations implementing those provisions in Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations will apply when determining whether a vessel is recreational.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What types of work may exclude a recreational-vessel worker from the definition of “employee”?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An individual who works on recreational vessels may be excluded from the definition of “employee” when:</P>
              <P>(1) The individual's date of injury is before February 17, 2009, the injury is covered under a State workers' compensation law, and the individual is employed to:</P>
              <P>(i) Build any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Repair any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Dismantle any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length.</P>

              <P>(2) The individual's date of injury is on or after February 17, 2009, the injury <PRTPAGE P="407"/>is covered under a State workers' compensation law, and the individual is employed to:</P>
              <P>(i) Build any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Repair any recreational vessel; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Dismantle any recreational vessel to repair it.</P>
              <P>(b) In applying paragraph (a) of this section, the following principles apply:</P>
              <P>(1) “Length” means a straight line measurement of the overall length from the foremost part of the vessel to the aftmost part of the vessel, measured parallel to the center line. The measurement must be from end to end over the deck, excluding sheer. Bow sprits, bumpkins, rudders, outboard motor brackets, handles, and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions are not included in the measurement.</P>
              <P>(2) “Repair” means any repair of a vessel including installations, painting and maintenance work. Repair does not include alterations or conversions that render the vessel a non-recreational vessel under § 701.501. For example, a worker who installs equipment on a private yacht to convert it to a passenger-carrying whale-watching vessel is not employed to “repair” a recreational vessel. Repair also does not include alterations or conversions that render a non-recreational vessel recreational under § 701.501.</P>
              <P>(3) “Dismantle” means dismantling any part of a vessel to complete a repair but does not include dismantling any part of a vessel to complete alterations or conversions that render the vessel a non-recreational vessel under § 701.501, or render the vessel recreational under § 701.501, or, if the date of injury is on or after February 17, 2009, to scrap or dispose of the vessel at the end of the vessel's life.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Did the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 amend the recreational vessel exclusion?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes. The amended exclusion was effective February 17, 2009, the effective date of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When does the recreational vessel exclusion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 apply?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Date of injury.</E> Whether the amended version applies depends on the date of the injury for which compensation is claimed. The following rules apply to determining the date of injury:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Traumatic injury.</E> If the individual claims compensation for a traumatic injury, the date of injury is the date the employee suffered harm. For example, if the individual injures an arm or leg in the course of his or her employment, the date of injury is the date on which the individual was hurt.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Occupational disease or infection.</E> Occupational illnesses and infections generally involve delayed onset of symptoms following exposure to a harmful workplace substance or condition. If the individual claims compensation for an occupational illness or infection, the date of injury is the date the individual was exposed to the substance or condition.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Hearing loss.</E> If the individual claims compensation for hearing loss, the date of injury is the date the individual was exposed to harmful workplace noise or other stimulus that is capable of causing hearing loss.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Death-benefit claims.</E> If the individual claims compensation for an employee's death, the date of injury is the date of the workplace event or incident that caused, hastened, or contributed to the death.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Cumulative trauma.</E> If the individual claims compensation for cumulative trauma, in which multiple traumas contribute to an overall medical condition, such as a neck condition resulting from repetitive motion, the date of injury is any date on which a workplace trauma worsened the individual's condition. A workplace event will not be deemed a contributing trauma if a corresponding worsening of the condition is due solely to its natural progression, rather than the workplace event.</P>

              <P>(b) If the date of injury is before February 17, 2009, the individual's entitlement is governed by section 2(3)(F) as it existed prior to the 2009 amendment.<PRTPAGE P="408"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) If the date of injury is on or after February 17, 2009, the individual's entitlement is governed by the 2009 amendment to section 2(3)(F).</P>

              <SUBJECT>May an employer stop paying benefits awarded before February 17, 2009 if the employee would now fall within the exclusion?</SUBJECT>
              <P>No. If an individual was awarded compensation for an injury occurring before February 17, 2009, the employer must still pay all benefits awarded, including disability compensation and medical benefits, even if the employee would be excluded from coverage under the amended exclusion.</P>

                <P>(a) If the employer or carrier declines to pay any compensation on or before the 30th day after receiving written notice from the district director of a claim for compensation having been filed, on the ground that there is no liability for compensation within the provisions of this Act, and the person seeking benefits shall thereafter have utilized the services of an attorney at law in the successful prosecution of his claim, there shall be awarded, in addition to the award of compensation, in a compensation order, a reasonable attorney's fee against the employer or carrier in an amount approved by the person, administrative body or court before whom the service was performed, which shall be paid directly by the employer or carrier to the attorney for the claimant in a lump sum after the compensation order becomes final (Act, section 28(a)).</P>

                <P>(b) If the employer or carrier pays or tenders payment of compensation without an award pursuant to § 702.231 and section 14 (a) and (b) of this Act, and thereafter a controversy develops over the amount of additional compensation, if any, to which the employee may be entitled, the district director, administrative law judge, or Board shall set the matter for an informal conference and following such conference the district director, administrative law judge, or Board shall recommend in writing a disposition of the controversy. If the employer or carrier refuses to accept such written recommendation, within 14 days after its receipt by them, they shall pay or tender to the employee in writing the additional compensation, if any, to which they believe the employee is entitled. If the employee refuses to accept such payment or tender of compensation, and thereafter utilizes the services of an attorney at law, and if the compensation thereafter awarded is greater than the amount paid or tendered by the employer or carrier, a reasonable attorney's fee based solely upon the difference between the amount awarded and the amount tendered or paid shall be awarded in addition to the amount of compensation. The foregoing sentence shall not apply if the controversy relates to degree or length of disability, and if the employer or carrier offers to submit the case for evaluation by physicians employed or selected by the district director, as authorized by section 7(e) of the Act and § 702.408, and offers to tender an amount of compensation based upon the degree or length of disability found by the independent medical report at such time as an evaluation of disability can be <PRTPAGE P="415"/>made. If the claimant is successful in review proceedings before the Board or court in any such case an award may be made in favor of the claimant and against the employer or carrier for a reasonable attorney's fee for claimant's counsel in accord with the above provisions. In all other cases any claim for legal services shall not be assessed against the employer or carrier (see Act, section 28(b)).</P>

The Act requires that the Treasurer give bond, in an amount to be fixed and with securities to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General of the United States, conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duty as custodian of such fund.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose of the special fund.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This special fund was established to give effect to a congressional policy determination that, under certain circumstances, the employer of a particular employee should not be required to bear the entire burden of paying for the compensation benefits due that employee under the Act. Instead, a substantial portion of such burden should be borne by the industry generally. Section 702.145 describes this special circumstance under which the particular employer is relieved of some of his burden. Section 702.146 describes the manner and circumstances of the input into the fund.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of the special fund.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Under section 10 of the Act.</E> This section provides for initial and subsequent annual adjustments in compensation and continuing payments to beneficiaries in cases of permanent total disability or death which commenced or occurred prior to enactment of the 1972 Amendments to this Act (Pub. L. 92-576, approved Oct. 27, 1972). At the discretion of the Director, such payments may be paid directly by him to eligible beneficiaries as the obligation accrues, one-half from the special fund and one-half from appropriations, or he may require insurance carriers or self-insured employers already making payments to such beneficiaries to pay such additional compensation as the amended Act requires. In the latter case such carriers and self-insurers shall be reimbursed by the Director for such additional amounts paid, in the proportion of one-half the amount from the special fund and one-half the amount from appropriations. To obtain reimbursement, the carriers and self-insurers shall submit claims for payments made by them during previous periods at intervals of not less than 6 months. A form has been prescribed for such purpose and shall be used. No administrative claims service expense incurred by the carrier or self-insurer shall be included in the claim and no such expense shall be allowed. The amounts reimbursed to such carrier or self-insurer shall be limited to amounts actually due and previously paid to beneficiaries.</P>

                <P>(b) Under section 8(f) of the Act (Second Injuries). In any case in which an employee having an existing permanent partial disability suffers injury, the employer shall provide compensation for such disability as is found to be attributable to that injury based upon the average weekly wages of the employee at the time of injury. If, following an injury falling within the provisions of section 8(c)(1)-(20), the employee with the pre-existing permanent partial disability becomes permanently and totally disabled after the second injury, but such total disability is found not to be due solely to his second injury, the employer (or carrier) shall be liable for compensation as provided by the provisions of section 8(c)(1)-(20) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(c)(1)-(20) or for 104 weeks, whichever is greater. However, if the injury is a loss of hearing covered by section 8(c)(13), 33 U.S.C. 908(c)(13), the liability shall be the lesser of these periods. In all other cases of a second injury causing permanent total disability (or death), wherein it is found that such disability (or death) is not due solely to the second injury, and wherein the employee had a pre-existing permanent partial disability, the employer (or carrier) shall first pay <PRTPAGE P="417"/>compensation under section 8(b) or (e) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(b) or (e), if any is payable thereunder, and shall then pay 104 weeks compensation for such total disability or death, and none otherwise. If the second injury results in permanent partial disability, and if such disability is compensable under section 8(c)(1)-(20) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(c)(1)-(20), but the disability so compensable did not result solely from such second injury, and the disability so compensable is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, then the employer (or carrier) shall only be liable for the amount of compensation provided for in section 8(c)(1)-(20) that is attributable to such second injury, or for 104 weeks, whichever is greater. However, if the injury is a loss of hearing covered by section 8(c)(13), 33 U.S.C. 908(c)(13), the liability shall be the lesser of these periods. In all other cases wherein the employee is permanently and partially disabled following a second injury, and wherein such disability is not attributable solely to that second injury, and wherein such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, and wherein such disability following the second injury is not compensable under section 8(c)(1)-(20) of the Act, then the employer (or carrier) shall be liable for such compensation as may be appropriate under section 8(b) or (e) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(b) or (e), if any, to be followed by a payment of compensation for 104 weeks, and none other. The term “compensation” herein means money benefits only, and does not include medical benefits. The procedure for determining the extent of the employer's (or carrier's) liability under this paragraph shall be as provided for in the adjudication of claims in subpart C of this part 702. Thereafter, upon cessation of payments which the employer is required to make under this paragraph, if any additional compensation is payable in the case, the district director shall forward such case to the Director for consideration of an award to the person or persons entitled thereto out of the special fund. Any such award from the special fund shall be by order of the Director or Acting Director.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Under sections 8(g) and 39(c)(2) of the Act.</E> These sections, 33 U.S.C. 908(g) and 939(c)(2), respectively, provide for vocational rehabilitation of disabled employees, and authorize, under appropriate circumstances, a maintenance allowance for the employee (not to exceed $25 a week) in additional to other compensation benefits otherwise payable for his injury-related disability. Awards under these sections are made from the special fund upon order of the Director or his designee. The district directors may be required to make investigations with respect to any case and forward to the Director their recommendations as to the propriety and need for such maintenance.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Under section 39(c)(2) of the Act.</E> In addition to the maintenance allowance for the employee discussed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Director is further authorized to use the fund in such amounts as may be necessary to procure the vocational training services.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Under section 7(e) of the Act.</E> This provision, 33 U.S.C. 907(e), authorizes payment by the Director from the special fund for special medical examinations, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, those obtained from impartial specialists to resolve disputes, when such special examinations are deemed necessary under that statutory provision. The Director has the discretionary power, however, to charge the cost of such examination to the insurance carrier or self-insured employer.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Under section 18(b) of the Act.</E> This section, 33 U.S.C. 918(b), provides a source for payment of compensation benefits in cases where the employer is insolvent, or other circumstances preclude the payment of benefits due in any case. In such situations, the district director shall forward the case to the Director for consideration of an award from the special fund, together with evidence with respect to the employer's insolvency or other reasons for nonpayment of benefits due. Benefits, as herein used, means medical care or supplies within the meaning of section 7 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 907, and subpart D of this part 702, as well as monetary benefits. Upon receipt of the case, the Director shall promptly determine <PRTPAGE P="418"/>whether an award from the special fund is appropriate and advisable in the case, having due regard for all other current commitments from the special fund. If such an award is made, the employer shall be liable for the repayment into the fund of the amounts paid therefrom, as provided in 33 U.S.C. 918(b).</P>

                <P>(b) Whenever an employee dies under circumstances creating a liability on an employer to pay death benefits to the employee's beneficiaries, and whenever there are no such beneficiaries entitled to such payments, the employer shall pay $5,000 into the special fund (Act, section 44(c)(1)). In such cases, the compensation order entered in the case shall specifically find that there is such liability and that there are no beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, and shall order payment by the employer into the fund. Compensation orders shall be made and filed in accordance with the regulations in subpart C of this part 702, except that for this purpose the district director settling the case under § 702.315 shall formalize the memorandum of conference in a compensation order, and shall file such order as provided for in § 702.349.</P>
                <P>(c) The Director annually shall assess an amount against insurance carriers and self-insured employers authorized under the Act and part 703 of this subchapter to replenish the fund. That total amount to be charged all carriers and self-insurers to be assessed shall be based upon an estimate of the probable expenses of the fund during the calendar year. The assessment against each carrier and self-insurer shall be based upon (1) the ratio of the amount each paid during the prior calendar year for compensation in relation to the amount all such carriers of self-insurers paid during that period for compensation, and (2) the ratio of the amount of payments made by the special fund for all cases being paid under section 8(f) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(f), during the preceding calendar year which are attributable to the carrier or self-insurer in relation to the total of such payments during such year attributable to all carriers and self-insurers. The resulting sum of the percentages from paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section will be divided by two, and the resulting percentage multiplied by the probable expenses of the fund. The Director may, in his or her discretion, condition continuance or renewal of authorization under part 703 upon prompt payment of the assessment. However, no action suspending or revoking such authorization shall be taken without affording such carrier or self-insurer a hearing before the Director or his/her designee.</P>

The Director may require the employer to have audits performed of claims activity relating to this Act. The Director may also require detailed reports of payments made under the Act, and of estimated future liabilities under the Act, from any or all carriers of self-insurers.

                <P>(a) Pursuant to section 17 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 917, when a trust fund which complies with section 302(c) of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. 186(c) [LMRA], established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect between an employer and an employee entitled to compensation under this Act, has paid disability benefits to an employee which the employee is legally obligated to repay by reason of his entitlement to compensation under this Act, a lien shall be authorized on such compensation in favor of the trust fund for the amount of such payments.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) An application for such a lien shall be filed on behalf of the trust <PRTPAGE P="420"/>fund with the district director for the compensation district where the claim for compensation has been filed, 20 CFR 702.101. Such application shall include a certified statement by an authorized official of the trust fund that:</P>
                <P>(i) The trust fund is entitled to a lien in its favor by reason of its payment of disability payments to a claimant-employee (including his name therein);</P>
                <P>(ii) The trust fund was created pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement covering the claimant-employee;</P>
                <P>(iii) The trust fund complies with section 302(c) of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. 186(c);</P>
                <P>(iv) The trust agreement contains a subrogation provision entitling the fund to reimbursement for disability benefits paid to the claimant-employee who is entitled to compensation under the Longshoremen's Act;</P>
                <P>(2) The statement shall also state the amount paid to the named claimant-employee and whether such disability benefit payments are continuing to be paid.</P>
                <P>(3) If the claimant has signed a statement acknowledging receipt of disability benefits from the trust fund and/or a statement recognizing the trust fund's entitlement to a lien against compensation payments which may be received under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act as a result of his present claim and for which the fund is providing disability payments, such statement(s) shall also be included with or attached to the application.</P>
                <P>(c) Upon receipt of this application, the district director shall, within a reasonable time, notify the claimant, the employer and/or its compensation insurance carrier that the request for a lien has been filed and each shall be provided with a copy of the application. If the claimant disputes the right of the trust fund to the lien or the amount stated, if any, he shall, within 30 days after receipt of the application or such other longer period as the district director may set, notify the district director and he shall be given an opportunity to challenge the right of the trust fund to, or the amount of, the asserted lien; notice to either the employer or its compensation insurance carrier shall constitute notice to both of them.</P>
                <P>(d) If the claim for compensation benefits is resolved without a formal hearing and if there is no dispute over the amount of the lien or the right of the trust fund to the lien, the district director may order and impose the lien and he shall notify all parties of the amount of the lien and manner in which it is to be paid.</P>
                <P>(e) If the claimant's claim for compensation cannot be resolved informally, the district director shall transfer the case to the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge for a formal hearing, pursuant to section 19(d) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 919(d), and 20 CFR 702.317. The district director shall also submit therewith the application for the lien and all documents relating thereto.</P>
                <P>(f) If the administrative law judge issues a compensation order in favor of the claimant, such order shall establish a lien in favor of the trust fund if it is determined that the trust fund has satisfied all of the requirements of the Act and regulations.</P>
                <P>(g) If the claim for compensation is not in dispute, but there is a dispute as to the right of the trust fund to a lien, or the amount of the lien, the district director shall transfer the matter together with all documents relating thereto to the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge for a formal hearing pursuant to section 19(d) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 919(d), and 20 CFR 702.317.</P>
                <P>(h) In the event that either the district director or the administrative law judge is not satisfied that the trust fund qualifies for a lien under section 17, the district director or administrative law judge may require further evidence including but not limited to the production of the collective bargaining agreement, trust agreement or portions thereof.</P>

                <P>(i) Before any such lien is approved, if the trust fund has provided continued disability payments after the application for a lien has been filed, the trust fund shall submit a further certified statement showing the total amount paid to the claimant as disability payments. The claimant shall likewise be given an opportunity to <PRTPAGE P="421"/>contest the amount alleged in this subsequent statement.</P>
                <P>(j) In approving a lien on compensation, the district director or administrative law judge shall not order an initial payment to the trust fund in excess of the amount of the past due compensation. The remaining amount to which the trust fund is entitled shall thereafter be deducted from the affected employee's subsequent compensation payments and paid to the trust fund, but any such payment to the trust fund shall not exceed 10 percent of the claimant-employee's bi-weekly compensation payments.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> Before any facility is exempt from coverage under the Act, the facility must apply for and receive <PRTPAGE P="422"/>a certificate of exemption from the Director or his/her designee. The application must be made by the owner of the facility; where the owner is a partnership it must be made by a partner and where a corporation by an officer of the corporation or the manager in charge of the facility for which an exemption is sought. The information submitted must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Name, location, physical description and a site plan or aerial photograph of the facility for which an exemption is sought.</P>
                <P>(2) Description of the nature of the business.</P>
                <P>(3) An affidavit (signed by a partner if the facility is owned by a partnership or an officer if owned by a corporation) vertifying and/or acknowledging that:</P>
                <P>(i) the facility is, as of the date of the application, engaged in the business of building, repairing or dismantling exclusively small commercial vessels and that it does not then nor foreseeably will it engage in the building, repairing or dismantling of other than small vessels.</P>
                <P>(ii) The facility does not receive any Federal maritime subsidy.</P>
                <P>(iii) The signator has the duty to immediately inform the district director of any change in these or other conditions likely to result in a termination of an exemption.</P>
                <P>(iv) the employer has secured appropriate compensation liability under a State workers' compensation law.</P>
                <P>(v) Any false, relevant statements relating to the application or the failure to notify the district director of any changes in circumstances likely to result in termination of the exemption will be grounds for revocation of the exemption certificate and will subject the employer to all provisions of the Act, including all duties, responsibilities and penalties, retroactive to the date of application or date of change in circumstances, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Action by the Director.</E> The Director or his/her designee must review the application within thirty (30) days of its receipt.</P>
                <P>(1) Where the application is complete and shows that all requirements under § 702.173 are met, the Director must promptly notify the employer that certification has been approved and will be effective on the date specified. The employer is required to post notice of the exemption at a conspicuous location.</P>
                <P>(2) Where the application is incomplete or does not substantiate that all requirements of section 3(d) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 903(d), have been met, or evidence shows the facility is not eligible for exemption, the Director must promptly notify the employer by issuing a letter which details the reasons for the deficiency or the rejection. The employer/applicant may reapply for certification, correcting deficiencies and/or responding to the reasons for the Director's denial. The Director or his/her designee must issue a new decision within a reasonable time of reapplication following denial. Such action will be the final administrative review and is not appealable to the Administrative Law Judge or the Benefits Review Board.</P>
                <P>(c) The Director or another designated individual at any time has the right to enter on and inspect any facility seeking exemption for purposes of verifying information provided on the application form.</P>

                <P>(a) In order to claim compensation under the Act, an employee or claimant must first give notice of the fact of an injury or death to the employer and also may give notice to the district director for the compensation district in which the injury or death occurred. Notice to the employer must be given to that individual whom the employer has designated to receive such notices. If no individual has been so designated notice may be given to: (1) The first line supervisor (including foreman, hatchboss or timekeeper), local plant manager or personnel office official; (2) to any partner if the employer is a partnership; or (3) if the employer is a corporation, to any authorized agent, to an officer or to the person in charge of the business at the place where the injury occurred. In the case of a retired employee, the employee/claimant may submit the notice to any of the above persons, whether or not the employer has designated an official to receive such notice.</P>
                <P>(b) In order to facilitate the filing of notices, each employer shall designate at least one individual responsible for receiving notices of injury or death; this requirement applies to all employers. The designation shall be by position and the employer shall provide the name and/or position, exact location and telephone number of the individual to all employees by the appropriate method described below.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Type of individual.</E> Designees must be a first line supervisor (including a foreman, hatchboss or timekeeper), local plant manager, personnel office official, company nurse or other individual traditionally entrusted with this duty, who is located full-time on the premises of the covered facility. The employer must designate at least one individual at each place of employment or one individual for each work crew where there is no fixed place of employment (in that case, the designation should always be the same position for all work crews).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">How designated.</E> The name and/or title, the location and telephone number of the individual who is selected by the employer to receive all notices shall be given to the district director for the compensation district in which the facility is located; posting on the worksite in a conspicuous place shall fulfill this requirement. A redesignation shall be effected by a change in posting.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Publication.</E> Every employer shall post the name and/or position, the exact location and telephone number of the designated official. The posting shall be part of the general posting requirement, done on a form prescribed by the Director, and placed in a conspicuous location. Posting must be done at each worksite.<PRTPAGE P="425"/>

                <P>(b) In the case of an occupational disease which does not immediately result in disability or death, notice must be given within one year after the employee or claimant becomes aware, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice, should have been aware, of the relationship between the employment, the disease and the death or disability. For purposes of these occupational diseases, therefore, the notice period does not begin to run until the employee is disabled, or in the case of a retired employee, until a permanent impairment exists.</P>

For purposes of this subsection, actual knowledge shall be deemed to exist if the employee's immediate supervisor was aware of the injury and/or in the case of a hearing loss, where the employer has furnished to the employee an audiogram and report which indicates a loss of hearing. Failure to give notice shall be excused by the district director if: a) Notice, while not given to the designated official, was given to an official of the employer or carrier, and no prejudice resulted; or b) for some other satisfactory reason, notice could not be given. Failure to properly designate and post the individual so designated shall be considered a satisfactory reason. In any event, such defense to a claim must be raised by the employer/carrier at the first hearing on the claim.</P>

In the case of minor who has no guardian before he or she becomes of age, time begins to run from the date he or she becomes of age.</P>

                <P>(b) Where a person brings a suit at law or in admiralty to recover damages in respect of an injury or death, or files a claim under a State workers' compensation act because such person is excluded from this Act's coverage by reason of section 2(3) or 3(d) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 902(3) or 903(d)), and recovery is denied because the person was an employee and defendant was an employer within the meaning of the Act, and such employer had secured compensation to such employee under the Act, the time limitation in § 702.221 <PRTPAGE P="427"/>shall not begin to run until the date of termination of such suit or proceeding.</P>
                <P>(c) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, where the claim is one based on disability or death due to an occupational disease which does not immediately result in death or disability, it must be filed within two years after the employee or claimant becomes aware, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice, should have been aware of the relationship between the employment, the disease and the death or disability, or within one year of the date of last payment of compensation, whichever is later. For purposes of occupational disease, therefore, the time limitation for filing a claim does not begin to run until the employee is disabled, or in the case of a retired employee, where a permanent impairment exists.</P>
                <P>(d) The time limitations set forth above do not apply to claims filed under section 49 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 949.</P>

                <P>(b) If a settlement application is submitted to an adjudicator and the case is pending at the Office of Administrative Law Judges, the Benefits Review Board, or any Federal circuit court of appeals, the parties may request that the case be remanded to the adjudicator for consideration of the application. The thirty day period as described in paragraph (f) of this section begins when the remanded case is received by the adjudicator.</P>
                <P>(c) If a settlement application is first submitted to an ALJ, the thirty day period mentioned in paragraph (f) of this section does not begin until five days before the date the formal hearing is set. This rule does not preclude the parties from submitting the application at any other time such as (1) after the case is referred for hearing, (2) at the hearing, or (3) after the hearing but before the ALJ issues a decision and order. Where a case is pending before the ALJ but not set for a hearing, the parties may request the case be remanded to the district director for consideration of the settlement.</P>
                <P>(d) A settlement agreement between parties represented by counsel, which is deemed approved when not disapproved within thirty days, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, shall be considered to have been filed in the office of the district director on the thirtieth day for purposes of sections 14 and 21 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 914 and 921.</P>
                <P>(e) A fee for representation which is included in an agreement that is approved in the manner described in paragraph (d) of this section, shall also be considered approved within the meaning of section 28(e) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 928(e).</P>
                <P>(f) The thirty day period for consideration of a settlement agreement shall be calculated from the day after receipt unless the parties are advised otherwise by the adjudicator. (See § 702.243(b)). If the last day of this period is a holiday or occurs during a weekend, the next business day shall be considered the thirtieth day.</P>
                <P>(g) An agreement among the parties to settle a claim is limited to the rights of the parties and to claims then in existence; settlement of disability compensation or medical benefits shall not be a settlement of survivor benefits nor shall the settlement affect, in any way, the right of survivors to file a claim for survivor's benefits.</P>

                <P>(a) The settlement application shall be a self-sufficient document which can be evaluated without further reference to the administrative file. The application shall be in the form of a stipulation signed by all parties and shall contain a brief summary of the facts of the case to include: a description of the incident, a description of the nature of the injury to include the degree of impairment and/or disability, a description of the medical care rendered to date of settlement, and a summary of compensation paid and the compensation rate or, where benefits have not been paid, the claimant's average weekly wage.</P>
                <P>(b) The settlement application shall contain the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A full description of the terms of the settlement which clearly indicates, where appropriate, the amounts to be paid for compensation, medical benefits, survivor benefits and representative's fees which shall be itemized as required by § 702.132.</P>
                <P>(2) The reason for the settlement, and the issues which are in dispute, if any.</P>
                <P>(3) The claimant's date of birth and, in death claims, the names and birth dates of all dependents.</P>

                <P>(4) Information on whether or not the claimant is working or is capable of working. This should include, but not be limited to, a description of the claimant's educational background and work history, as well as other factors <PRTPAGE P="430"/>which could impact, either favorably or unfavorably, on future employability.</P>
                <P>(5) A current medical report which fully describes any injury related impairment as well as any unrelated conditions. This report shall indicate whether maximum medical improvement has been reached and whether further disability or medical treatment is anticipated. If the claimant has already reached maximum medical improvement, a medical report prepared at the time the employee's condition stabilized will satisfy the requirement for a current medical report. A medical report need not be submitted with agreements to settle survivor benefits unless the circumstances warrant it.</P>
                <P>(6) A statement explaining how the settlement amount is considered adequate.</P>
                <P>(7) If the settlement application covers medical benefits an itemization of the amount paid for medical expenses by year for the three years prior to the date of the application. An estimate of the claimant's need for future medical treatment as well as an estimate of the cost of such medical treatment shall also be submitted which indicates the inflation factor and/or the discount rate used, if any. The adjudicator may waive these requirements for good cause.</P>
                <P>(8) Information on any collateral source available for the payment of medical expenses.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Settlement application; how submitted, how approved, how disapproved, criteria.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When the parties to a claim for compensation, including survivor benefits and medical benefits, agree to a settlement they must submit a complete application to the adjudicator. The application must contain all the information outlined in § 702.242 and must be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested, commercial delivery service with tracking capability that provides reliable proof of delivery to the adjudicator, or electronically through an OWCP-authorized system. Failure to submit a complete application will toll the thirty day period mentioned in section 8(i) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(i), until a complete application is received.</P>
                <P>(b) The adjudicator must consider the settlement application within thirty days and either approve or disapprove the application. The liability of an employer/insurance carrier is not discharged until the settlement is specifically approved by a compensation order issued by the adjudicator. However, if the parties are represented by counsel, the settlement will be deemed approved unless specifically disapproved within thirty days after receipt of a complete application. This thirty day period does not begin until all the information described in § 702.242 has been submitted. The adjudicator will examine the settlement application within thirty days and must immediately serve on all parties notice of any deficiency. This notice must also indicate that the thirty day period will not commence until the deficiency is corrected.</P>
                <P>(c) If the adjudicator disapproves a settlement application, the adjudicator must serve on all parties a written statement or order containing the reasons for disapproval. This statement must be served within thirty days of receipt of a complete application (as described in § 702.242) if the parties are represented by counsel. If the disapproval was made by a district director, any party to the settlement may request a hearing before an ALJ as provided in sections 8 and 19 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908 and 919, or an amended application may be submitted to the district director. If, following the hearing, the ALJ disapproves the settlement, the parties may: (1) Submit a new application, (2) file an appeal with the Benefits Review Board as provided in section 21 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 921, or (3) proceed with a hearing on the merits of the claim. If the application is initially disapproved by an ALJ, the parties may (1) submit a new application or (2) proceed with a hearing on the merits of the claim.</P>

                <P>(d) The parties may submit a settlement application solely for compensation, or solely for medical benefits or for compensation and medical benefits combined.<PRTPAGE P="431"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) If either portion of a combined compensation and medical benefits settlement application is disapproved the entire application is disapproved unless the parties indicate on the face of the application that they agree to settle either portion independently.</P>
                <P>(f) When presented with a settlement, the adjudicator must review the application and determine whether, considering all of the circumstances, including, where appropriate, the probability of success if the case were formally litigated, the amount is adequate. The criteria for determining the adequacy of the settlement application will include, but not be limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) The claimant's age, education and work history;</P>
                <P>(2) The degree of the claimant's disability or impairment;</P>
                <P>(3) The availability of the type of work the claimant can do;</P>
                <P>(4) The cost and necessity of future medical treatment (where the settlement includes medical benefits).</P>
                <P>(g) In cases being paid pursuant to a final compensation order, where no substantive issues are in dispute, a settlement amount which does not equal the present value of future compensation payments commuted, computed at the discount rate specified below, must be considered inadequate unless the parties to the settlement show that the amount is adequate. The probability of the death of the beneficiary before the expiration of the period during which he or she is entitled to compensation will be determined according to the most current United States Life Table, as developed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, which will be updated from time to time. The discount rate will be equal to the coupon issue yield equivalent (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) of the average accepted auction price for the last auction of 52 weeks U.S. Treasury Bills settled immediately prior to the date of the submission of the settlement application.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Discrimination; against employees who bring proceedings, prohibition and penalty.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) No employer or its duly authorized agent may discharge or in any manner discriminate against an employee as to his/her employment because that employee: (i) Has claimed or attempted to claim compensation under this Act; or (ii) has testified or is about to testify in a proceeding under this Act. To discharge or refuse to employ a person who has been adjudicated to have filed a fraudulent claim for compensation or otherwise made a false statement or misrepresentation under section 31(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 931(a)(1), is not a violation of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) Any employer who violates this section, and has penalties assessed for such violation after January 15, 2020, shall be liable for a penalty of not less than $2,444 or more than $12,219 to be paid (by the employer alone, and not by a carrier) to the district director for deposit in the special fund described in section 44 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 944; and shall restore the employee to his or her employment along with all wages lost due to the discrimination unless the employee has ceased to be qualified to perform the duties of employment.</P>
                <P>(b) When a district director receives a complaint from an employee alleging discrimination as defined under section 49, he or she shall notify the employer, and within five working days, initiate specific inquiry to determine all the facts and circumstances pertaining thereto. This may be accomplished by interviewing the employee, employer representatives and other parties who may have information about the matter. Interviews may be conducted by written correspondence, telephone or personal interview.</P>
                <P>(c) If circumstances warrant, the district director may also conduct an informal conference on the issue as described in §§ 702.312 through 702.314.</P>
                <P>(d) Any employee discriminated against is entitled to be restored to his employment and to be compensated by the employer for any loss of wages arising out of such discrimination provided that the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the employment. If it is determined that the employee has been discriminated against, the district director shall also determine whether the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the employment. The district director may use medical evidence submitted by the parties or he may arrange to have the employee examined by a physician selected by the district director. The cost of the medical examination arranged for by the district director may be charged to the special fund established by section 44, 33 U.S.C. 944.</P>

The district director may also assess the employer an appropriate penalty, as determined under authority vested in the district director by the Act. If the district director determines that no violation occurred he must notify the parties of his findings and the reasons for recommending that the complaint be denied. If the employer and employee accept the district director's recommendation, within 10 days it will be incorporated in an order, to be filed and served in accordance with § 702.349.</P>
                <P>(b) If the parties do not agree to the recommendation, the district director must, within 10 days after receipt of the rejection, prepare a memorandum summarizing the disagreement, send a copy to all interested parties, and within 14 days thereafter, refer the case to the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge for hearing pursuant to § 702.317.</P>

                <P>(a) Every person claiming benefits under this Act (or the representative) must promptly notify the employer and the district director when:</P>
                <P>(1) A claim is made that someone other than the employer or person or persons in its employ, is liable in damages to the claimant because of the injury or death and identify such party by name and address.</P>
                <P>(2) Legal action is instituted by the claimant or the representative against some person or party other than the employer or a person or persons in his employ, on the ground that such other person is liable in damages to the claimant on account of the compensable injury and/or death; specify the amount of damages claimed and identify the person or party by name and address.</P>
                <P>(3) Any settlement, compromise or any adjudication of such claim has been effected and report the terms, conditions and amounts of such resolution of claim.</P>
                <P>(b) Where the claim or legal action instituted against a third party results in a settlement agreement which is for an amount less than the compensation to which a person would be entitled under this Act, the person (or the person's representative) must obtain the prior, written approval of the settlement from the employer and the employer's carrier before the settlement is executed. Failure to do so relieves the employer and/or carrier of liability for compensation described in section 33(f) of Act, 33 U.S.C. 933(f) and for medical benefits otherwise due under section 7 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 907, regardless of whether the employer or carrier has made payments of acknowledged entitlement to benefits under the Act. The approval must be on a form provided by OWCP and must be filed, within thirty days after the settlement is entered into, with the district director who is administering the claim.</P>

                <P>(a) Any employee who fails to submit the report on earnings from employment or self-employment under § 702.285 or, who knowingly and willingly omits or understates any part of such earnings, shall upon a determination by the district director forfeit all right to compensation with respect to any period during which the employee was required to file such a report. The employee must return the completed report on earnings (even where he or she reports no earnings) within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt; this period may be extended for good cause, by the district director, in determining whether a violation of this requirement has occurred.</P>
                <P>(b) Any employer or carrier who believes that a violation of paragraph (a) of this section has occurred may file a charge with the district director. The allegation shall be accompanied by evidence which includes a copy of the report, with proof of service requesting the information from the employee and clearly stating the dates for which the employee was required to report income. Where the employer/carrier is alleging an omission or understatement of earnings, it shall, in addition, present evidence of earnings by the employee during that period, including copies of checks, affidavits from employers who paid the employee earnings, receipts of income from self-employment or any other evidence showing earnings not reported or underreported for the period in question. Where the district director finds the evidence sufficient to support the charge he or she shall convene an informal conference as described in subpart C and shall issue a compensation order affiming or denying the charge and setting forth the amount of compensation for the specified period. If there is a conflict over any issue relating to this matter any party may request a formal hearing before an Administrative Law Judge as described in subpart C.</P>
                <P>(c) Compensation forfeited under paragraph (b) of this section, if already paid, shall be recovered by a deduction from the compensation payable to the employee if any, on such schedule as determined by the district director. The district director's discretion in such cases extends only to rescheduling repayment by crediting future compensation and not to whether and in what amounts compensation is forfeited. For this purpose, the district director shall consider the employee's essential expenses for living, income from whatever source, and assets, including cash, savings and checking accounts, stocks, bonds, and other securities.</P>

                <P>The regulations in this subpart govern the adjudication of claims in which the employer has filed a notice of controversion under § 702.251, or the employee has filed notice of contest under § 702.261. In the vast majority of cases, the problem giving rise to the controversy results from misunderstandings, clerical or mechanical errors, or mistakes of fact or law. Such problems seldom require resolution through formal hearings, with the attendant production of expert witnesses. Accordingly, by § 702.311 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> the district directors are empowered to amicably and promptly resolve such problems by informal procedures. Where there is a genuine dispute of fact or law which cannot be so disposed of informally, resort must be had to the formal hearing procedures as set forth beginning at § 702.331. Supplementary compensation orders, modifications, and interlocutory matters are governed by regulations beginning with § 702.371. Thereafter, appeals from compensation orders are discussed beginning with § 702.391 (the regulations of the Benefits Review Board are set forth in full in part 802 of this title).</P>

                <P>The district director is empowered to resolve disputes with respect to claims in a manner designed to protect the <PRTPAGE P="435"/>rights of the parties and also to resolve such disputes at the earliest practicable date.

The regulations governing informal conferences at the district director's office with all parties present are set forth below. When handling claims by telephone, or at the office with only one of the parties, the district director and his staff shall make certain that a full written record be made of the matters discussed and that such record be placed in the administrative file. When claims are handled by correspondence, copies of all communications shall constitute the administrative file.</P>

If either party requests that a formal compensation order be issued, the district director must, within 30 days of such request, prepare, file, and serve such order in accordance with § 702.349. Where the problem was of such nature that it was resolved by telephone discussion or by exchange of written correspondence, the district director must prepare a memorandum or order setting forth the terms agreed upon and notify the parties either by telephone or in writing, as appropriate. In either instance, when the employer or carrier has agreed to pay, reinstate or increase monetary compensation benefits, or to restore or appropriately change medical care benefits, such action must be commenced immediately upon becoming aware of the agreement, and without awaiting receipt of the memorandum or the formal compensation order.</P>

Copies of this memorandum shall then be sent to each of the parties or their representatives, who shall then have 14 days within which to signify in writing to the district director whether they agree or disagree with his or her recommendations.

                <P>(c) Upon receipt of the completed forms, the district director, after checking them for completeness and after any further conferences that, in his or her opinion, are warranted, will transmit them to the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge by letter of transmittal together with all available evidence which the parties intend to submit at the hearings (exclusive of X-rays, slides and other materials not suitable for transmission which may be offered into evidence at the time of the hearing); the materials transmitted must not include any recommendations expressed or memoranda prepared by the district director pursuant to § 702.316.</P>
                <P>(d) If the completed pre-hearing statement forms raise new or additional issues not previously considered by the district director or indicate that material evidence will be submitted that could reasonably have been made available to the district director before he or she prepared the last memorandum of conference, the district director will transfer the case to the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge only after having considered such issues or evaluated such evidence or both and having issued an additional memorandum of conference in conformance with § 702.316.</P>
                <P>(e) If a party fails to complete or return his or her pre-hearing statement form within the time allowed, the district director may, at his or her discretion, transmit the case without that party's form. However, such transmittal must include a statement from the district director setting forth the circumstances causing the failure to include the form, and such party's failure to submit a pre-hearing statement form may, subject to rebuttal at the formal hearing, be considered by the administrative law judge, to the extent intransigence is relevant, in subsequent rulings on motions which may be made in the course of the formal hearing.</P>

A fully documented application must contain a specific description of the pre-existing condition relied upon as constituting an existing permanent partial disability and the reasons for believing that the claimant's permanent disability after the injury would be less were it not for the pre-existing permanent partial disability or that the death would not have ensued but for that disability. These reasons must be supported by medical evidence as specified in this paragraph. The application must also contain the basis for the assertion that the pre-existing condition relied upon was manifest in the employer and documentary medical evidence relied upon in support of the request for section 8(f) relief. This medical evidence must include, but not be limited to, a current medical report establishing the extent of all impairments and the date of maximum medical improvement. If the claimant has already reached maximum medical improvement, a report prepared at that time will satisfy the requirement for a current medical report. If the current disability is total, the medical report must explain why the disability is not due solely to the second injury. If the current disability is partial, the medical report must explain why the disability is not due solely to the second injury and why the resulting disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone. If the injury is loss of hearing, the pre-existing hearing loss must be documented by an audiogram which complies with the requirements of § 702.441. If the claim is for survivor's benefits, the medical report must establish that the death was not due solely to the second injury. Any other evidence considered necessary for consideration of the request for section 8(f) relief must be submitted when requested by the district director or Director.</P>
                <P>(2) If claim is being paid by the special fund and the claimant dies, an employer need not reapply for section 8(f) relief. However, survivor benefits will not be paid until it has been established that the death was due to the accepted injury and the eligible survivors have been identified. The district director will issue a compensation order after a claim has been filed and entitlement of the survivors has been verified. Since the employer remains a party in interest to the claim, a compensation order will not be issued without the agreement of the employer.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Application: Time for filing.</E> (1) A request for section 8(f) relief should be made as soon as the permanency of the <PRTPAGE P="438"/>claimant's condition becomes known or is an issue in dispute. This could be when benefits are first paid for permanent disability, or at an informal conference held to discuss the permanency of the claimant's condition. Where the claim is for death benefits, the request should be made as soon as possible after the date of death. Along with the request for section 8(f) relief, the applicant must also submit all the supporting documentation required by this section, described in paragraph (a) of this section. Where possible, this documentation should accompany the request, but may be submitted separately, in which case the district director must, at the time of the request, fix a date for submission of the fully documented application. The date must be fixed as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Where notice is given to all parties that permanency will be an issue at an informal conference, the fully documented application must be submitted at or before the conference. For these purposes, notice means when the issue of permanency is noted on the form LS-141, Notice of Informal Conference. All parties are required to list issues reasonably anticipated to be discussed at the conference when the initial request for a conference is made and to notify all parties of additional issues which arise during the period before the conference is actually held.</P>
                <P>(ii) Where the issue of permanency is first raised at the informal conference and could not have reasonably been anticipated by the parties prior to the conference, the district director must adjourn the conference and establish the date by which the fully documented application must be submitted and so notify the employer/carrier. The date will be set by the district director after reviewing the circumstances of the case.</P>
                <P>(2) At the request of the employer or insurance carrier, and for good cause, the district director, at his/her discretion, may grant an extension of the date for submission of the fully documented application. In fixing the date for submission of the application under circumstances other than described above or in considering any request for an extension of the date for submitting the application, the district director must consider all the circumstances of the case, including but not limited to: Whether the claimant is being paid compensation and the hardship to the claimant of delaying referral of the case to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ); the complexity of the issues and the availability of medical and other evidence to the employer; the length of time the employer was or should have been aware that permanency is an issue; and, the reasons listed in support of the request. If the employer/carrier requested a specific date, the reasons for selection of that date will also be considered. Neither the date selected for submission of the fully documented application nor any extension therefrom can go beyond the date the case is referred to the OALJ for formal hearing.</P>

                <P>(3) Where the claimant's condition has not reached maximum medical improvement and no claim for permanency is raised by the date the case is referred to the OALJ, an application need not be submitted to the district director to preserve the employer's right to later seek relief under section 8(f) of the Act. In all other cases, failure to submit a fully documented application by the date established by the district director will be an absolute defense to the liability of the special fund. This defense is an affirmative defense which must be raised and pleaded by the Director. The absolute defense will not be raised where permanency was not an issue before the district director. In all other cases, where permanency has been raised, the failure of an employer to submit a timely and fully documented application for section 8(f) relief will not prevent the district director, at his/her discretion, from considering the claim for compensation and transmitting the case for formal hearing. The failure of an employer to present a timely and fully documented application for section 8(f) relief may be excused only where the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the liability of the special fund prior to the consideration of the claim by the district director. Relief under section 8(f) is not available to an employer who fails to comply with section 32(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 932(a).<PRTPAGE P="439"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Application: Approval, disapproval.</E> If all the evidence required by paragraph (a) of this section was submitted with the application for section 8(f) relief and the facts warrant relief under this section, the district director must award such relief after concurrence by the Associate Director, DLHWC, or his or her designee. If the district director or the Associate Director or his or her designee finds that the facts do not warrant relief under section 8(f) the district director must advise the employer of the grounds for the denial. The application for section 8(f) relief may then be considered by an administrative law judge. When a case is transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law Judges the district director must also attach a copy of the application for section 8(f) relief submitted by the employer, and notwithstanding § 702.317(c), the district director's denial of the application.</P>

                <P>(a) An administrative law judge must, within 20 days after the official termination of the hearing, deliver by mail, or otherwise, to the district director that administered the claim, the transcript of the hearing, other documents or pleadings filed with him with respect to the claim, and his signed compensation order. Upon receipt thereof, the district director, being the official custodian of all records with respect to claims he administers, must formally date and file the transcript, pleadings, and compensation order in his office. Such filing must be accomplished by the close of business on the next succeeding working day, and the district director must, on the same day as the filing was accomplished, serve a copy of the compensation order on the parties and on the representatives of the parties, if any. Service on the parties and their representatives must be made by certified mail unless a party has previously waived service by this method under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

                <P>(4) All compensation orders issued in a claim after receipt of the waiver form will be sent to the electronic address provided on the waiver form. Any changes to the address must be made by submitting another waiver form. Individuals may revoke their service waiver at any time by submitting a new waiver form that specifies that the service waiver is being revoked.</P>
                <P>(5) If it appears that service in the manner selected by the individual has not been effective, the district director will serve the individual by certified mail.</P>

                <P>(a) In any case in which the employer or insurance carrier is in default in the payment of compensation due under any award of compensation, for a period of 30 days after the compensation is due and payable, the person to whom such compensation is payable may, within 1 year after such default, apply in writing to the district director for a supplementary compensation order declaring the amount of the default. Upon receipt of such application, the district director will institute proceedings with respect to such application as if such application were an original claim for compensation, and the matter will be disposed of as provided for in § 702.315, or if agreement on the issue is not reached, then as in §§ 702.316 through 702.319.</P>
                <P>(b) If, after disposition of the application as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, a supplementary compensation order is entered declaring the amount of the default, which amount may be the whole of the award notwithstanding that only one or more installments is in default, a copy of such supplementary order must be filed and served in accordance with § 702.349. Thereafter, the applicant may obtain and file with the clerk of the Federal district court for the judicial district where the injury occurred or the district in which the employer has his principal place of business or maintains an office, a certified copy of said order and may seek enforcement thereof as provided for by section 18 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 918.</P>

                <P>(a) Upon his/her own initiative, or upon application of any party in interest (including an employer or carrier which has been granted relief under section 8(f) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 908(f)), the district director may review any compensation case (including a case under which payments are made pursuant to section 44(i) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 944(i)) in accordance with the procedure in subpart C of this part, and after such review of the case under § 702.315, or review at formal hearings under the regulations governing formal hearings in subpart C of this part, file a new compensation order terminating, continuing, reinstating, increasing or decreasing such compensation, or awarding compensation. Such new order shall not affect any compensation previously paid, except that an award increasing the compensation rate may be made retroactive from the date of injury, and if any part of the compensation due or to become due is unpaid, an award decreasing the compensation rate may be made effective from the date of the injury, and any payment made prior thereto in excess of such decreased rate shall be deducted from any unpaid compensation, in such manner and by such method as may be determined by the district director or the administrative law judge. Settlements cannot be modified.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Review of a compensation case under this section may be made at any time prior to 1 year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, or at any time prior to 1 year after the rejection of a claim.</P>
                <P>(c) Review of a compensation case may be had only for the reason that there is a change in conditions or that there was a mistake in the determination of facts.</P>
                <P>(d) If the investigation, described in § 702.148(c), discloses a change in conditions and the employer or insurance carrier intends to pursue modification of the award of compensation the district director and claimant shall be notified through an informal conference. At the conclusion of the informal conference the district director shall issue a recommendation either for or against the modification. This recommendation shall also be sent to the Associate Director, Division of Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation (DLHWC) for a determination on whether or not to participate in the modification proceeding on behalf of the special fund. Lack of concurrence of the Associate Director, DLHWC or lack of participation by a representative of the special fund shall not be a bar to the modification proceeding.</P>

The opinion of the Director that a charge by a medical care provider disputed under the provisions of section 702.414 exceeds the charge which prevails in the community in which said medical care provider is located shall constitute sufficient evidence to warrant further proceedings pursuant to section 702.414 and to permit the Director to direct the claimant to select another medical provider for care to the claimant.</P>

The Director's investigation may initially be conducted informally through contact of the medical care provider by the district director. If this informal investigation is unsuccessful further proceedings may be undertaken. These proceedings may include, but not be limited to: an informal conference involving all interested parties; agency interrogatories to the pertinent medical care provider; and issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for documents having a bearing on the dispute.</P>
              <P>(1) A claim by the provider that the OWCP fee schedule does not represent the prevailing community rate will be considered only where the following circumstances are presented:</P>
              <P>(i) where the actual procedure performed was incorrectly identified by medical procedure code;</P>
              <P>(ii) that the presence of a severe or concomitant medical condition made treatment especially difficult;</P>
              <P>(iii) the provider possessed unusual qualifications (board certification in a specialty is not sufficient evidence in itself of unusual qualifications); or</P>

              <P>(iv) the provider or service is not one covered by the OWCP fee schedule as described by 20 CFR 10.805 <E T="03">through 10.810.</E>

              <P>(c) After any proceeding under this section the Director shall make specific findings on whether the fee exceeded the prevailing community charges (as established by the OWCP fee schedule, where appropriate) or the provider's customary charges and provide notice of these findings to the affected parties.</P>
              <P>(d) The Director may suspend any such proceedings if after receipt of the written complaint the affected parties agree to withdraw the controversy from agency consideration on the basis that such controversy has been resolved by the affected parties. Such suspension, however, shall be at the discretion of the Director.</P>

However, to be acceptable under this subsection, a licensed or certified audiologist or otolaryngologist, as defined, must ultimately interpret and certify the results of the audiogram. The accompanying report must set forth the testing standards used and describe the method of evaluating the hearing loss as well as providing an evaluation of the reliability of the test results.</P>
                <P>(2) The employee was provided the audiogram and a report thereon at the time it was administered or within thirty (30) days thereafter.</P>

                <P>(3) No one produces a contrary audiogram of equal probative value (meaning one performed using the standards described herein) made at the same time. “Same time” means within thirty (30) days thereof where noise exposure continues or within six (6) months where exposure to excessive noise levels does not continue. Audiometric tests performed prior to the enactment <PRTPAGE P="454"/>of Public Law 98-426 will be considered presumptively valid if the employer complied with the procedures in this section for administering audiograms.</P>
                <P>(c) In determining the amount of pre-employment hearing loss, an audiogram must be submitted which was performed prior to employment or within thirty (30) days of the date of the first employment-related noise exposure. Audiograms performed after December 27, 1984 must comply with the standards described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

                <P>(d) In determining the loss of hearing under the Act, the evaluators shall use the criteria for measuring and calculating hearing impairment as published and modified from time-to-time by the American Medical Association in the <E T="03">Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,</E> using the most currently revised edition of this publication. In addition, the audiometer used for testing the individual's threshold of hearing must be calibrated according to current American National Standard Specifications for Audiometers. Audiometer testing procedures required by hearing conservation programs pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 should be followed (as described at 29 CFR 1910.95 and appendices).</P>

                <P>(2) A survivor is “newly awarded compensation” on the date the employee died; and</P>
                <P>(3) An employee or survivor is “currently receiving compensation” when compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits is payable, regardless of when payment is actually made.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What weekly maximum rates apply to compensation for permanent partial disability, temporary total disability, and temporary partial disability?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The maximum rate in effect on the date of disability applies to all compensation payable for permanent partial disability, temporary partial disability, and temporary total disability.</P>
                <P>(b) Examples:</P>
                <P>(1) Employee <E T="03">A</E> suffers a covered workplace injury on April 1, 2000, is temporarily totally disabled from that day through June 4, 2002, and is thereafter permanently partially disabled. All compensation payable for <E T="03">A's</E> disability is subject to the FY 2000 maximum rate.</P>
                <P>(2) Employee <E T="03">B</E> suffers a covered workplace injury on August 25, 2010, and is temporarily totally disabled <PRTPAGE P="459"/>until September 25, 2010, when he returns to work. On January 3, 2011, he again becomes temporarily totally disabled from the same injury. He ceases work and is unable to return until November 22, 2012. All compensation payable for <E T="03">B's</E> disability is subject to the FY 2010 maximum rate.</P>
                <P>(3) Employee <E T="03">C</E> retires on May 6, 2011. She discovers on November 10, 2012, that she has a compensable occupational disease. All compensation payable for <E T="03">C's</E> occupational disease is subject to the FY 2013 maximum rate. <E T="03">See</E> § 702.601(b) (occupational diseases discovered post-retirement are compensated as permanent partial disabilities).</P>

                <SUBJECT>What weekly maximum rates apply to compensation for permanent total disability?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The maximum rate in effect on the date that the employee became totally and permanently disabled applies to all compensation payable for permanent total disability during that fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(b) For all periods the employee is permanently and totally disabled in subsequent fiscal years, the weekly compensation payable is subject to each subsequent year's maximum rate.</P>
                <P>(c) If a claimant is receiving compensation for permanent total disability at the maximum rate for the current fiscal year, but the next fiscal year's maximum rate will be higher than the claimant's calculated compensation rate, the claimant's compensation for the next fiscal year will increase by the amount of the 10(f) adjustment, subject to the maximum rate for the next fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(d) Examples:</P>
                <P>(1) Employee <E T="03">A</E> suffers a covered workplace injury on April 1, 2000, and is permanently and totally disabled from that date forward. <E T="03">A's</E> compensation for the period from April 1, 2000, until September 30, 2000, is subject to the FY 2000 maximum rate. Beginning October 1, 2000, <E T="03">A's</E> compensation for FY 2001 is subject to the FY 2001 maximum rate, compensation for FY 2002 is subject to the FY 2002 maximum rate, <E T="03">etc.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Employee <E T="03">B</E> suffers a covered workplace injury on April 1, 2000, is temporarily totally disabled from that day through June 3, 2002, and is thereafter permanently totally disabled. <E T="03">B's</E> compensation for the period from April 1, 2000, through June 3, 2002, is subject to the FY 2000 maximum rate (<E T="03">see</E> § 702.805(a)). <E T="03">B's</E> compensation for the period from June 4, 2002, through September 30, 2002, is subject to the FY 2002 maximum rate. Beginning October 1, 2002, <E T="03">B's</E> compensation for FY 2003 is subject to the FY 2003 maximum rate, compensation for FY 2004 is subject to the FY 2004 maximum rate, <E T="03">etc.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(3) Employee <E T="03">C</E> suffers a covered workplace injury in FY 2009 and is permanently totally disabled from that day forward. He was earning $1,950.00 a week when he was injured, making his calculated compensation rate $1,300.00 ($1,950.00 × 2 ÷ 3). His calculated compensation rate exceeds the maximum rate from FY 2009-2012; thus, his compensation is limited to each year's maximum rate. In FY 2013, <E T="03">C's</E> calculated compensation rate of $1,300.00 is, for the first time, less than the FY 2013 maximum rate of $1,325.18. Applying the FY 2013 2.31% section 10(f) adjustment to <E T="03">C's</E> FY 2012 compensation rate of $1,295.20 results in a compensation rate of $1,325.00 ($1,295.20 × .0231 = $29.92, rounded to the nearest cent; $1,295.20 + $29.92 = $1,325.12, rounded to the nearest dollar). This amount falls just below the FY 2013 maximum rate of $1,325.18. Thus, <E T="03">C's</E> benefit rate for FY 2013 is $1,325.00, and is not limited by the maximum rate.</P>

                </P>

                <P>(2) If death benefits were paid in the first year at the employee's full average weekly wage under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the aggregate weekly death benefits paid for each subsequent year may not exceed the current benefit rate plus the subsequent year's section 10(f) adjustment (<E T="03">see</E> § 702.701).</P>
                <P>(d) Post-retirement occupational diseases: Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, if an employee's death results from an occupational disease where the date of disability occurred after the employee voluntarily retired—</P>
                <P>(1) Aggregate weekly death benefits paid to all eligible survivors during the fiscal year in which the employee died must not exceed the lower of:</P>

                <P>(ii) One fifty-second part of the employee's average annual earnings during the 52-week period preceding retirement.</P>

                <P>(i) Aggregate weekly death benefits paid during each subsequent fiscal year are subject to each subsequent year's maximum rate.</P>

                <P>(ii) If death benefits were paid in the first year at 1/52 part of the employee's average annual earnings prior to retirement under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the aggregate weekly death benefits paid for each subsequent year may not exceed the current benefit rate plus the subsequent year's section 10(f) adjustment (<E T="03">see</E> § 702.701).</P>
                <P>(e) Examples:</P>
                <P>(1) Employee <E T="03">A</E> suffers a covered workplace injury on May 1, 2013, and is permanently and totally disabled from that date until August 1, 2014, when he dies due to the injury. He has one eligible survivor and his average weekly wage at the time of injury was $3,000.00. The calculated compensation rate for <E T="03">A's</E> survivor is $1,500.00 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 50% of <E T="03">A's</E> average weekly wage). <E T="03">A's</E> weekly survivor's benefits for the period from August 2, 2014, to September 30, 2014, are limited to the FY 2014 maximum rate of $1,346.68. Beginning October 1, 2014, <E T="03">A's</E> survivor's benefits for FY 2015 are subject to the FY 2015 maximum rate, benefits for FY 2016 are subject to the FY 2016 maximum rate, <E T="03">etc.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Employee <E T="03">B</E> suffers a covered workplace injury and dies on December 1, 2012. She has one eligible survivor and her average weekly wage was $300.00. Because <E T="03">B's</E> average weekly wage of $300.00 falls below the FY 2013 national average weekly wage of $662.59, death benefits are calculated at 50% of that national average wage (<E T="03">see</E> 33 U.S.C. 909(e)). This yields a calculated compensation rate of $331.30. But because this rate exceeds <E T="03">B's</E> actual average weekly wages, weekly death benefits payable during FY 2013 are limited to $300.00. In FY 2014, <E T="03">B's</E> survivor is entitled to a 1.62% section 10(f) adjustment, resulting in weekly death benefits of $305.00 ($300.00 × .0162 = $4.86; $300.00 + $4.86 = $304.86, rounded to the nearest dollar). <E T="03">B's</E> survivor would continue to receive section 10(f) adjustments in subsequent fiscal years.</P>
                <P>(3) Employee <E T="03">C</E> retired on February 1, 1998. During his last year of employment, he earned $23,000. He discovers on April 15, 2002, that he has a compensable occupational disease resulting in a 50% permanent impairment. <E T="03">See</E> § 702.601(b). Because he retired more than one year before this date, his payrate for calculating compensation is the FY 2002 national average weekly wage, or $483.04. <E T="03">See</E> § 702.603(b). He is entitled to weekly compensation of $161.01 ($483.04 × 2 ÷ 3 × 50%). <E T="03">C</E> dies from the disease on June 1, 2015, leaving two survivors. The payrate for calculating death benefits is the FY 2015 national average weekly wage, or $688.51. <E T="03">See</E> § 702.604(b). The survivors' aggregate calculated compensation rate is $459.01 ($688.51 × 2 ÷ 3). But because compensation cannot exceed <FR>1/52</FR> part of <E T="03">C's</E> last year of earnings, aggregate weekly death benefits payable for FY 2015 are limited to $442.31 ($23,000 ÷ 52). For FY 2016, <E T="03">C's</E> survivors are entitled to a 2.10% section 10(f) adjustment resulting in weekly death benefits of $452.00 ($442.31 × .021 = $9.29, rounded to the nearest cent; $442.31 + $9.29 = $451.60, rounded to the nearest dollar). <E T="03">C's</E> survivors would continue to receive section 10(f) adjustments in subsequent fiscal years.</P>

His average weekly wages at the time of disability were $500.00. Because his calculated compensation rate (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 66 and <FR>2/3</FR>% of $500.00, or $333.34) is lower than the $336.67 FY 2014 minimum rate, <E T="03">A's</E> compensation is raised to $336.67 for the entire period of his disability.</P>

                <P>(2) The employee's average weekly wage on the date of disability.</P>
                <P>(c) Example: Employee <E T="03">A</E> suffers a covered workplace injury on April 1, 2003, and is permanently totally disabled from that day forward. He was earning $250.00 a week when he was injured. His calculated compensation rate is $166.67 ($250 × 2 ÷ 3). The FY 2003 minimum rate is $249.14. Because <E T="03">A's</E> calculated compensation rate is below the FY 2003 minimum rate, and his actual weekly wage is above that rate, he is entitled to compensation at the minimum rate of $249.14 from April 1, 2003, to September 30, 2003. The FY 2004 minimum rate is $257.70. Because <E T="03">A's</E> actual weekly wages on the date of disability are lower than the FY 2004 minimum rate, <E T="03">A's</E> minimum weekly compensation rate for FY 2004 is $250.00. His weekly compensation rate for FY 2004, however, is higher because of a section 10(f) adjustment. For FY 2004, <E T="03">A's</E> compensation rate is increased by a 3.44% section 10(f) adjustment, raising his compensation level to $258.00 ($249.14 × .0344 = $8.57; $249.14 + $8.57 = $257.71, rounded to the nearest dollar).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Failure to secure coverage; penalties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each employer must secure the payment of compensation under the Act either through an authorized insurance carrier or by becoming an authorized self-insurer under section 32(a)(1) or (2) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 932(a)(1) or (2)). An employer who fails to comply with these provisions is subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not more than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Where the employer is a corporation, the president, secretary and treasurer each will also be subject to this fine and/or imprisonment, in addition to the fine against the corporation, and each is severally personally liable, jointly with the corporation, for all compensation or other benefits payable under the Act while the corporation fails to secure the payment of compensation.</P>
              <P>(b) Any employer who willingly and knowingly transfers, sells, encumbers, assigns or in any manner disposes of, conceals, secretes, or destroys any property belonging to the employer after an employee sustains an injury covered by the Act, with the intent to avoid payment of compensation under the Act to that employee or his/her dependents, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished, upon conviction, by a fine of not more than $10,000 and/or imprisonment for one year. Where the employer is a corporation, the president, secretary and treasurer are also severally liable to imprisonment and, along with the corporation, jointly liable for the fine.</P>

              <P>An application for authority to write insurance under this Act shall be made in writing, signed by an officer of the applicant duly authorized to make such application, and transmitted to the Office of Workmen's Compensation Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. Such application shall be accompanied by full and complete information regarding the history and experience of such applicant in the writing of workmen's compensation insurance, together with evidence that it has authority in its charter or form of organization to write such insurance, and evidence that the applicant is currently authorized to insure workmen's compensation liability under the laws of the United States or of any State. The statements of fact in each application and in the supporting evidence shall be verified by the oath of the officer of the applicant who signs such application. Each applicant shall state in its application the area or areas, in <PRTPAGE P="464"/>which it intends to do business. In connection with any such application the following shall be submitted, the Office reserving the right to call for such additional information as it may deem necessary in any particular case:</P>
              <P>(a) A copy of the last annual report made by the applicant to the insurance department or other authority of the State in which it is incorporated, or the State in which its principal business is done.</P>
              <P>(b) A certified copy from the proper State authorities of the paper purporting to show the action taken upon such report, or such other evidence as the applicant desires to submit in respect of such report, which may obviate delay caused by an inquiry of the OWCP of the State authorities relative to the standing and responsibility of the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) A full and complete statement of its financial condition, if not otherwise shown, and, if a stock company, shall show specifically its capital stock and surplus.</P>
              <P>(d) A copy of its charter or other formal outline of its organization, its rules, its bylaws, and other documents, writings, or agreements by and under which it does business, and such other evidence as it may deem proper to make a full exposition of its affairs and financial condition.</P>

Any such certificate issued by the Office, after application therefor in accordance with these regulations, may authorize the applicant to write such insurance in a limited territory as determined by the Office. Any such certificate may be suspended or revoked by the Office prior to its expiration for good cause shown, but no suspension or revocation shall affect the liability of any carrier already incurred. Good cause shall include, without limitation, the failure to maintain in such limited territory a regular business office with full authority to act on all matters falling within the Act, and the failure to promptly and properly perform the carrier's responsibilities under the Act and these regulations, with special emphasis upon lack of promptness in making payments when due, upon failure to furnish appropriate medical care, and upon attempts to offer to, or <PRTPAGE P="465"/>urge upon, claimants inequitable settlements. A hearing may be requested by the aggrieved party and shall be held before the Director or his representative prior to the taking of any adverse action under this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deposits of security by insurance carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The regulations in this subpart require certain insurance carriers to deposit security in the form of indemnity bonds, letters of credit or negotiable securities (chosen at the option of the carrier) of a kind and in an amount determined by the Office, and prescribe the conditions under which deposits must be made. Security deposits secure the payment of compensation and medical benefits when an insurance carrier defaults on any of its obligations under the LHWCA, regardless of the date such obligations arose. They also secure the payment of compensation and medical benefits when a carrier becomes insolvent and such obligations are not otherwise fully secured by a State guaranty fund. Any gap in State guaranty fund coverage will have a direct effect on the amount of security the Office will require a carrier to post. As used in this subpart, the terms “obligations under the Act” and “LHWCA obligations” mean a carrier's liability for compensation payments and medical benefits arising under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and any of its extensions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Identification of significant gaps in State guaranty fund coverage for LHWCA obligations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In determining the amount of a carrier's required security deposit, the Office will consider the extent to which a State guaranty fund secures the insurance carrier's LHWCA obligations in that State. When evaluating State guaranty funds, the Office may consider a number of factors including, but not limited to—</P>
              <P>(1) Limits on weekly benefit amounts;</P>
              <P>(2) Limits on aggregate maximum benefit amounts;</P>
              <P>(3) Time limits on coverage;</P>
              <P>(4) Ocean marine exclusions;</P>
              <P>(5) Employer size and viability provisions; and</P>
              <P>(6) Financial strength of the State guaranty fund itself.</P>

              <P>(b) OWCP will identify States without guaranty funds and States with guaranty funds that do not fully and immediately secure LHWCA obligations and will post its findings on the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc.</E> These findings will indicate the extent of any partial or total gap in coverage provided by a State guaranty fund, and they will be open for inspection and comment by all interested parties. If the extent of coverage a particular State guaranty fund provides either cannot be determined or is ambiguous, OWCP will deem one third (33<FR>1/3</FR> percent) of a carrier's LHWCA obligations in that State to be unsecured. OWCP will revise its findings from time to time, in response to substantiated public comments it receives or for any other reasons it considers relevant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application for security deposit determination; information to be submitted; other requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each insurance carrier authorized by OWCP to write insurance under the LHWCA or any of its extensions, and each insurance carrier seeking initial <PRTPAGE P="468"/>authorization to write such insurance, must apply annually, on a schedule set by OWCP, for a determination of the extent of its unsecured obligations and the security deposit required. The application must be addressed to the Branch of Financial Management and Insurance (Branch) within OWCP's Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation, and be made on a form provided by OWCP. The application must contain the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Any carrier seeking an exemption from the security deposit requirements based on its financial standing (<E T="03">see</E> § 703.204(c)(1)) must submit documentation establishing the carrier's current rating and its rating for the immediately preceding year from each insurance rating service designated by the Branch and posted on the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) All other carriers, and any carrier whose exemption request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has been denied, must provide—</P>
              <P>(i) A statement of the carrier's outstanding liabilities under the LHWCA or any of its extensions for its LHWCA obligations for each State in which the obligations arise; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any other information the Branch requests to enable it to give the application adequate consideration including, but not limited to, the reports set forth at § 703.212.</P>
              <P>(b) If the carrier disagrees with any of OWCP's findings regarding State guaranty funds made under § 703.202(b) as they exist when it submits its application, the carrier may submit a statement of its unsecured obligations based on a different conclusion regarding the extent of coverage afforded by one or more State guaranty funds. The carrier must submit evidence and/or argument with its application sufficient to establish that such conclusion is correct.</P>
              <P>(c) The carrier must sign and swear to the application. If the carrier is not an individual, the carrier's duly authorized officer must sign and swear to the application and list his or her official designation. If the carrier is a corporation, the officer must also affix the corporate seal.</P>
              <P>(d) At any time after filing an application, the carrier must inform the Branch immediately of any material changes that may have rendered its application incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.</P>
              <P>(e) By filing an application, the carrier consents to be bound by and to comply with the regulations and requirements in this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Decision on insurance carrier's application; minimum amount of deposit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Branch will issue a decision on the application determining the extent of an insurance carrier's unsecured LHWCA obligations and fixing the amount of security the carrier must deposit to fully secure payment of its unsecured obligations. The Branch will transmit its decision to the applicant in a way it considers appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) The Branch may consider a number of factors in setting the security deposit amount including, but not limited to, the—</P>
              <P>(1) Financial strength of the carrier as determined by private insurance rating organizations;</P>
              <P>(2) Financial strength of the carrier's insureds in the Longshore industry;</P>
              <P>(3) Extent to which State guaranty funds secure the carrier's LHWCA obligations in the event the carrier defaults on its obligations or becomes insolvent;</P>
              <P>(4) Carrier's longevity in writing LHWCA or other workers' compensation coverage;</P>
              <P>(5) Extent of carrier's exposure for LHWCA coverage; and</P>
              <P>(6) Carrier's payment history in satisfying its LHWCA obligations.</P>
              <P>(c) In setting the security deposit amount, the Branch will follow these criteria:</P>

              <P>(1) Carriers who hold the highest rating awarded by each of the three insurance rating services designated by the Branch and posted on the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc</E> for both the current rating year and the immediately preceding year will not be required to deposit security.</P>

              <P>(2) Carriers whose LHWCA obligations are fully secured by one or more State guaranty funds, as evaluated by <PRTPAGE P="469"/>OWCP under § 703.202 of this subpart, will not be required to deposit security.</P>
              <P>(3) The Branch will require all carriers not meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section to deposit security for their LHWCA obligations not secured by a State guaranty fund, as evaluated by OWCP under § 703.202 of this subpart. For carriers that write only an insignificant or incidental amount of LHWCA insurance, the Branch will require a deposit in an amount determined by the Branch from time to time. For all other carriers, the Branch will require a minimum deposit of one third (33<FR>1/3</FR> percent) of a carrier s outstanding LHWCA obligations not secured by a State guaranty fund, but may require a deposit up to an amount equal to the carrier's total outstanding LHWCA obligations (100 percent) not secured by a State guaranty fund.</P>
              <P>(d) If a carrier believes that a lesser deposit would fully secure its LHWCA obligations, the carrier may request a hearing before the Director of the Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation (Longshore Director) or the Longshore Director's representative. Requests for hearing must be in writing and sent to the Branch within 10 days of the date of the Branch's decision. The carrier may submit new evidence and/or argument in support of its challenge to the Branch's decision and must provide any additional documentation OWCP requests. The Longshore Director or his representative will notify the carrier of the hearing date within 10 days of receiving the request. The Longshore Director or his representative will issue the final agency decision on the application within 60 days of the hearing date, or, where evidence is submitted after the hearing, within 60 days of the receipt of such evidence, but no later than 180 days after receiving the carrier's request for a hearing.</P>

              <P>(1) Deposit with the Branch indemnity bonds or letters of credit in the amount fixed by the Office, or deposit negotiable securities under §§ 703.207 and 703.208 in that amount;</P>

              <P>(2) In the form of letters of credit issued by a financial institution satisfactory to the Branch and upon which the Branch may draw; or</P>
              <P>(3) By a deposit of negotiable securities with a Federal Reserve Bank or the Treasurer of the United States in compliance with §§ 703.207 and 703.208.</P>

              <P>(b) The Branch may reduce the required security at any time on its own initiative, or upon application of a carrier, when in the Branch's opinion the facts warrant a reduction. A carrier seeking a reduction must furnish any information the Office requests regarding its outstanding LHWCA obligations for any State in which it does business, its obligations not secured by a State guaranty fund in each of these States, and any other evidence as the Branch considers necessary.</P>

              <P>The regulations in this subpart set forth procedures for authorizing employers to self-insure the payment of <PRTPAGE P="472"/>compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, or its extensions. The Office may authorize any employer to self-insure who, pursuant to the regulations in this part, furnishes to the Office satisfactory proof of its ability to pay compensation directly, and who agrees to immediately cancel any existing insurance policy covering its Longshore obligations (except for excess or catastrophic workers' compensation insurance, <E T="03">see</E> §§ 703.302(a)(6), 703.304(a)(6)) when OWCP approves the employer's application to be self-insured. The regulations require self-insurers to deposit security in the form of an indemnity bond, letters of credit or negotiable securities (at the option of the employer) of a kind and in an amount determined by the Office, and prescribe the conditions under which such deposits shall be made. The term “self-insurer” as used in these regulations means any employer securing the payment of compensation under the LHWCA or its extensions in accordance with the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 932(a)(2) and these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application for authority to become a self-insurer; how filed; information to be submitted; other requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any employer may apply to become an authorized self-insurer. The application must be addressed to the Branch of Financial Management and Insurance (Branch) within OWCP's Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation, and be made on a form provided by OWCP. The application must contain—</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the employer's total payroll for the 12 months before the application date;</P>
              <P>(2) A statement of the average number of employees engaged in employment within the purview of the LHWCA or any of its extensions for the 12 months before the application date;</P>
              <P>(3) A statement of the number of injuries to such employees resulting in disability of more than 7 days' duration, or in death, during each of the 5 years before the application date;</P>
              <P>(4) A certified financial report for each of the three years before the application date;</P>
              <P>(5) A description of the facilities maintained or the arrangements made for the medical and hospital care of injured employees;</P>
              <P>(6) A statement describing the provisions and maximum amount of any excess or catastrophic insurance; and</P>
              <P>(7) Any other information the Branch requests to enable it to give the application adequate consideration including, but not limited to, the reports set forth at § 703.310.</P>
              <P>(b) The employer must sign and swear to the application. If the employer is not an individual, the employer's duly authorized officer must sign and swear to the application and list his or her official designation. If the employer is a corporation, the officer must also affix the corporate seal.</P>
              <P>(c) At any time after filing an application, the employer must inform the Branch immediately of any material changes that may have rendered its application incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.</P>
              <P>(d) By filing an application, the employer consents to be bound by and to comply with the regulations and requirements in this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 703.303</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Decision on employer's application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Branch will issue a decision granting or denying the employer's application to be an authorized self-insurer. If the Branch grants the application, the decision will fix the amount of security the employer must deposit. The Branch will transmit its decision to the employer in a way it considers appropriate.</P>

              <P>(b) The employer is authorized to self-insure beginning with the date of the Branch's decision. Each grant of authority to self-insure is conditioned, however, upon the employer's execution and filing of an Agreement and Undertaking and deposit of the security fixed in the decision in the form and within the time limits required by § 703.304. In the event the employer fails to comply with the requirements set forth in § 703.304, its authorization to self-insure will be considered never to have been effective, and the employer will be subject to appropriate penalties for failure to secure its LHWCA obligations.<PRTPAGE P="473"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) The Branch will require security in the amount it considers necessary to fully secure the employer's LHWCA obligations. When fixing the amount of security, the Branch may consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the—</P>
              <P>(1) Employer's overall financial standing;</P>
              <P>(2) Nature of the employer's work;</P>
              <P>(3) Hazard of the work in which the employees are employed;</P>
              <P>(4) Employer's payroll amount for employees engaged in employment within the purview of the Act; and</P>
              <P>(5) Employer's accident record as shown in the application and the Office's records.</P>
              <P>(d) If an employer believes that the Branch incorrectly denied its application to self-insure, or that a lesser security deposit would fully secure its LHWCA obligations, the employer may request a hearing before the Director of the Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation (Longshore Director) or the Longshore Director's representative. Requests for hearing must be in writing and sent to the Branch within ten days of the date of the Branch's decision. The employer may submit new evidence and/or argument in support of its challenge to the Branch's decision and must provide any additional documentation OWCP requests. The Longshore Director or his representative will notify the employer of the hearing date within 10 days of receiving the request. The Longshore Director or his representative will issue the final agency decision on the application within 60 days of the hearing date, or, where evidence is submitted after the hearing, within 60 days of the receipt of such evidence, but no later than 180 days after receiving the employer's request for a hearing.</P>

              <P>Within 45 days of the date on which the employer receives the Branch's decision (or, if the employer requests a hearing, a period set by the Longshore Director or the Longshore Director's representative) granting its application to self-insure and fixing the required security deposit amount (<E T="03">see</E> § 703.303), the employer must:</P>
              <P>(a) Execute and file with the Branch an Agreement and Undertaking, in a form prescribed and provided by OWCP, in which the employer shall agree to:</P>
              <P>(1) Pay when due, as required by the provisions of the Act, all compensation payable on account of injury or death of any of its employees injured within the purview of the Act;</P>
              <P>(2) Furnish medical, surgical, hospital, and other attendance, treatment and care as required by the Act;</P>
              <P>(3) Deposit with the Branch indemnity bonds or letters of credit in the amount fixed by the Office, or deposit negotiable securities under §§ 703.306 and 703.307 in that amount;</P>
              <P>(4) Authorize the Branch, at its discretion, to bring suit under any deposited indemnity bond or to draw upon any deposited letters of credit, as appropriate under the terms of the security instrument, or to collect the interest and principal as they become due on any deposited negotiable securities and to seize and sell or otherwise liquidate such negotiable securities or any part thereof when the employer:</P>
              <P>(i) Defaults on any of its LHWCA obligations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Fails to renew any deposited letter of credit or substitute a new letter of credit, indemnity bond or acceptable negotiable securities in its place;</P>
              <P>(iii) Fails to renew any deposited negotiable securities at maturity or substitute a letter of credit, indemnity bond or acceptable negotiable securities in their place; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Fails to comply with any of the terms of the Agreement and Undertaking;</P>
              <P>(5) Authorize the Branch, at its discretion, to pay such compensation, medical, and other expenses and any accrued penalties imposed by law as it may find to be due and payable from the proceeds of the deposited security; and</P>
              <P>(6) Obtain and maintain, if required by the Office, excess or catastrophic insurance in amounts to be determined by the Office.</P>
              <P>(b) Give security in the amount fixed in the Office's decision:</P>

              <P>(1) In the form of an indemnity bond with sureties satisfactory to the Office, <PRTPAGE P="474"/>and in such form and containing such provisions as the Office may prescribe: <E T="03">Provided</E>, That only surety companies approved by the United States Treasury Department under the laws of the United States and the rules and regulations governing bonding companies may act as sureties on such indemnity bonds (<E T="03">see</E> Department of Treasury's Circular-570);</P>
              <P>(2) In the form of letters of credit issued by a financial institution satisfactory to the Branch and upon which the Branch may draw; or,</P>
              <P>(3) By a deposit of negotiable securities with a Federal Reserve Bank or the Treasurer of the United States in compliance with §§ 703.306 and 703.307.</P>

              <P>A self-insurer or a self-insurer applicant electing to deposit negotiable securities to secure its obligations under the Act in the amount fixed by the Office under the regulations in this part shall deposit any negotiable securities acceptable as security for the deposit of public monies of the United States under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. (<E T="03">See</E> 31 CFR part 225.)

              <P>Deposits of negotiable securities provided for by the regulations in this part shall be made with any Federal Reserve bank or any branch of a Federal Reserve bank designated by the Office, or the Treasurer of the United States, and shall be held subject to the order of the Office.

              <SUBJECT>Substitution and withdrawal of indemnity bond, letters of credit or negotiable securities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A self-insurer may not substitute other security for any indemnity bond or letters of credit deposited under the regulations in this part except when authorized by the Office. A self-insurer may, however, substitute negotiable securities acceptable under the regulations in this part for previously-deposited negotiable securities without the Office's prior approval.</P>
              <P>(b) A self-insurer discontinuing business, discontinuing operations within the purview of the Act, or securing the payment of compensation by commercial insurance under the provisions of the Act may apply to the Office for the withdrawal of the security it provided under the regulations in this part. The self-insurer must file with its application a sworn statement setting forth—</P>
              <P>(1) A list of all cases in each compensation district in which the self-insurer is paying compensation, together with the names of the employees and other beneficiaries, a description of causes of injury or death, and a statement of the amount of compensation paid;</P>
              <P>(2) A similar list of all pending cases in which the self-insurer has not yet paid compensation; and</P>
              <P>(3) A similar list of all cases in which injury or death has occurred within one year before such application or in which the last payment of compensation was made within one year before such application.</P>
              <P>(c) The Office may authorize withdrawal of previously-deposited indemnity bonds, letters of credit and negotiable securities that, in the opinion of the Office, are not necessary to provide adequate security for the payment of the self-insurer's outstanding and potential LHWCA obligations. No withdrawals will be authorized unless there has been no claim activity involving the self-insurer for a minimum of five years, and the Office is reasonably certain no further claims will arise.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Increase or reduction in the amount of indemnity bond, letters of credit or negotiable securities.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Whenever the Office considers the principal sum of the indemnity bond or <PRTPAGE P="475"/>letters of credit filed or the amount of the negotiable securities deposited by a self-insurer insufficient to fully secure the self-insurer's LHWCA obligations, the self-insurer must, upon demand by the Office, deposit additional security in accordance with the regulations in this part in an amount fixed by the Branch. The Branch will issue its decision requiring additional security in accordance with § 703.303, and the procedures set forth at §§ 703.303(d) and 703.304 for requesting a hearing and complying with the Office's decision will apply as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) The Office may reduce the required security at any time on its own initiative, or upon application of a self-insurer, when in the Office's opinion the facts warrant a reduction. A self-insurer seeking a reduction must furnish any information the Office requests regarding its current affairs, the nature and hazard of the work of its employees, the amount of its payroll for employees engaged in maritime employment within the purview of the Act, its financial condition, its accident experience, a record of compensation payments it has made, and any other evidence the Branch considers necessary.</P>

              <P>(c) When the Office, within its discretion, determines that it no longer needs to collect the interest and principal of any negotiable securities seized pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, or to retain the proceeds of their sale, it must return any of the employer's negotiable securities still in its possession and any remaining proceeds of their sale.</P>

              <P>(2) A sworn statement showing by classifications the payroll of employees of the self-insurer who are engaged in employment within the purview of the LHWCA or any of its extensions.</P>
              <P>(3) A sworn statement covering the six-month period preceding the date of such report, listing by compensation districts all death and injury cases which have occurred during such period, together with a report of the status of all outstanding claims showing the particulars of each case.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever it considers necessary, the Office may inspect or examine a self-insurer's books of account, records, and other papers to verify any financial statement or other information the self-insurer furnished to the Office in any report required by this section, or any other section of the regulations in this part. The self-insurer must permit the Office or its duly authorized representative to make the inspection or examination. Alternatively, the Office may accept an adequate report of a certified public accountant.</P>

              <P>(a) Self-insurance authorizations will remain in effect for so long as the self-<PRTPAGE P="476"/>insurer complies with the requirements of the Act, the regulations in this part, and OWCP.</P>
              <P>(b) A self-insurer who has secured its liability by depositing an indemnity bond with the Office will, on or about May 10 of each year, receive from the Office a form for executing a bond that will continue its self-insurance authorization. The submission of such bond, duly executed in the amount indicated by the Office, will be deemed a condition of the continuing authorization.</P>

              <P>Every employer who has secured the payment of compensation as required by 33 U.S.C. 932 and by the regulations in this part may request a certificate from the district director in the compensation district in which he has operations, and for which a certificate is required by 33 U.S.C. 937, showing that such employer has secured the payment of compensation. Only one such certificate will be issued to an employer in a compensation district, and it will be valid only during the period for which such employer has secured such payment. An employer so desiring may have photocopies of such a certificate made for use in different places within the compensation district. Two forms of such certificates have been provided by the Office, one form for use where the employer has obtained insurance generally under these regulations, and one for use where the employer has been authorized as a self-insurer.</P>

An employer holding certificate of compliance under an insurance policy which has expired, pending renewal of such insurance need not return such certificate of compliance if such expired insurance is promptly replaced.

              <P>Section 402(f) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish criteria for determining total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis to be applied in the processing and adjudication of claims filed under Part C of the Act. Section 402(f) further authorizes the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, to establish criteria for all appropriate medical tests administered in connection with a claim for benefits. Section 413(b) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish criteria for the techniques used to take chest roentgenograms (x-rays) in connection with a claim for benefits under the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) With the exception of the second sentence of § 718.204(a), this part is applicable to the adjudication of all claims filed on or after June 30, 1982 under Part C of the Act. It provides standards for establishing entitlement to benefits under the Act and describes the criteria for the development of medical evidence used in establishing such entitlement.

              <P>(c) The provisions of this part must, to the extent appropriate, be construed together in the adjudication of claims.</P>

              <P>(a) This part sets forth the standards to be applied in determining whether a coal miner is or was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or died due to pneumoconiosis. It also specifies the procedures and requirements to be followed in conducting medical examinations and in administering various tests relevant to such determinations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Chest radiographs (X-rays).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A chest radiograph (X-ray) must be of suitable quality for proper classification of pneumoconiosis and must conform to the standards for administration and interpretation of chest X-rays as described in Appendix A.</P>
              <P>(b) Chest X-rays may be produced by either film or digital radiography systems as defined in Appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(c) The images described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section will not be considered of suitable quality for proper classification of pneumoconiosis under this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Digital images derived from film screen chest X-rays (e.g., by scanning or digital photography); and</P>
              <P>(2) Images that were acquired using digital systems and then printed on transparencies for back-lighted display (e.g., using traditional view boxes).</P>
              <P>(d) Standards for classifying radiographs:</P>
              <P>(1) To establish the existence of pneumoconiosis, a film chest X-ray must be classified as Category 1, 2, 3, A, B, or C, in accordance with the International Labour Organization (ILO) classification system established in one of the following:</P>

              <P>(i) Guidelines for the Use of the ILO International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses, revised edition 2011 (incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 718.5).</P>

              <P>(2) To establish the existence of pneumoconiosis, a digital chest radiograph must be classified as Category 1, 2, 3, A, B, or C, in accordance with the ILO classification system established in Guidelines for the Use of the ILO International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses, revised edition 2011.</P>
              <P>(3) A chest radiograph classified under any of the foregoing ILO classification systems as Category 0, including subcategories 0-, 0/0, or 0/1, does not constitute evidence of pneumoconiosis.</P>
              <P>(e) An X-ray report must include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The name and qualifications of the person who took the X-ray.</P>
              <P>(2) The name and qualifications of the physician who interpreted the X-ray. The interpreting physician must indicate whether he or she was a Board-certified radiologist, a Board-eligible radiologist, or a Certified B Reader as defined below on the date the interpretation was made.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Board-certified radiologist</E> means that the physician is certified in radiology or diagnostic radiology by the American Board of Radiology, Inc., or the American Osteopathic Association.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Board-eligible radiologist</E> means that the physician has successfully completed a formal accredited residency program in radiology or diagnostic radiology.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Certified B Reader</E> means that the physician has demonstrated ongoing proficiency in evaluating chest radiographs for radiographic quality and in the use of the ILO classification for interpreting chest radiographs for pneumoconiosis and other diseases by taking and passing a specially designed proficiency examination given on behalf of or by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and has maintained that certification through the date the interpretation is made. <E T="03">See</E> 42 CFR 37.52(b).</P>
              <P>(3) A description and interpretation of the findings in terms of the ILO classification described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) A statement that the X-ray was interpreted in compliance with this section.</P>

              <P>(f) Radiograph Submission: For film X-rays, the original film on which the X-ray report is based must be supplied to OWCP. For digital X-rays, a copy of the original digital object upon which the X-ray report is based, formatted to meet the standards for transmission of <PRTPAGE P="484"/>diagnostic chest images set forth in Appendix A, paragraph (d), must be provided to OWCP on a DVD or other media specified by OWCP. In cases where the law prohibits the parties or a physician from supplying the original film or a copy of the digital image, the report will be considered as evidence only if the original film or digital image is otherwise available to OWCP and the other parties.</P>
              <P>(g) Where the chest X-ray of a deceased miner has been lost or destroyed, or is otherwise unavailable, a report of the chest X-ray submitted by any party may be considered in connection with the claim.</P>
              <P>(h) Except as provided in this paragraph (h), no chest X-ray may constitute evidence of the presence or absence of pneumoconiosis unless it is conducted and reported in accordance with the requirements of this section and Appendix A. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, compliance with the requirements of Appendix A must be presumed. In the case of a deceased miner where the only available X-ray does not substantially comply with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, the X-ray may form the basis for a finding of the presence or absence of pneumoconiosis if it is of sufficient quality for determining whether pneumoconiosis is present and it was interpreted by a Board-certified radiologist, Board-eligible radiologist, or Certified B Reader.</P>

              <P>(a) Any report of pulmonary function tests submitted in connection with a claim for benefits shall record the results of flow versus volume (flow-volume loop). The instrument shall simultaneously provide records of volume versus time (spirometric tracing). The report shall provide the results of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC). The report shall also provide the FEV1/FVC ratio, expressed as a percentage. If the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is reported, the results of such test shall be obtained independently rather than calculated from the results of the FEV1.</P>
              <P>(b) All pulmonary function test results submitted in connection with a claim for benefits shall be accompanied by three tracings of the flow versus volume and the electronically derived volume versus time tracings. If the MVV is reported, two tracings of the MVV whose values are within 10% of each other shall be sufficient. Pulmonary function test results developed in connection with a claim for benefits shall also include a statement signed by the physician or technician conducting the test setting forth the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Date and time of test;</P>
              <P>(2) Name, DOL claim number, age, height, and weight of claimant at the time of the test;</P>
              <P>(3) Name of technician;</P>
              <P>(4) Name and signature of physician supervising the test;</P>
              <P>(5) Claimant's ability to understand the instructions, ability to follow directions and degree of cooperation in performing the tests. If the claimant is unable to complete the test, the person executing the report shall set forth the reasons for such failure;</P>
              <P>(6) Paper speed of the instrument used;</P>
              <P>(7) Name of the instrument used;</P>
              <P>(8) Whether a bronchodilator was administered. If a bronchodilator is administered, the physician's report must detail values obtained both before and after administration of the bronchodilator and explain the significance of the results obtained; and</P>
              <P>(9) That the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section have been complied with.</P>

              <P>(c) Except as provided in this paragraph, no results of a pulmonary function study shall constitute evidence of the presence or absence of a respiratory or pulmonary impairment unless it is conducted and reported in accordance with the requirements of this section and Appendix B to this part. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, compliance with the requirements of Appendix B shall be presumed. In the case of a deceased miner, where no pulmonary function tests are in substantial compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) and Appendix B, noncomplying tests may form the basis for <PRTPAGE P="485"/>a finding if, in the opinion of the adjudication officer, the tests demonstrate technically valid results obtained with good cooperation of the miner.</P>

              <P>(a) A report of any physical examination conducted in connection with a claim shall be prepared on a medical report form supplied by the Office or in a manner containing substantially the same information. Any such report shall include the following information and test results:</P>
              <P>(1) The miner's medical and employment history;</P>
              <P>(2) All manifestations of chronic respiratory disease;</P>
              <P>(3) Any pertinent findings not specifically listed on the form;</P>
              <P>(4) If heart disease secondary to lung disease is found, all symptoms and significant findings;</P>
              <P>(5) The results of a chest X-ray conducted and interpreted as required by § 718.102; and</P>
              <P>(6) The results of a pulmonary function test conducted and reported as required by § 718.103. If the miner is physically unable to perform a pulmonary function test or if the test is medically contraindicated, in the absence of evidence establishing total disability pursuant to § 718.304, the report must be based on other medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, such as a blood gas study.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), a report of physical examination may be based on any other procedures such as electrocardiogram, blood-gas studies conducted and reported as required by § 718.105, and other blood analyses which, in the physician's opinion, aid in his or her evaluation of the miner.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of a deceased miner, where no report is in substantial compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b), a report prepared by a physician who is unavailable may nevertheless form the basis for a finding if, in the opinion of the adjudication officer, it is accompanied by sufficient indicia of reliability in light of all relevant evidence.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Treating physician.</E> In weighing the medical evidence of record relevant to whether the miner suffers, or suffered, from pneumoconiosis, whether the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment, and whether the miner is, or was, totally disabled by pneumoconiosis or died due to pneumoconiosis, the adjudication officer must give consideration to the relationship between the miner and any treating physician whose report is admitted into the record. Specifically, the adjudication officer shall take into consideration the following factors in weighing the opinion of the miner's treating physician:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Nature of relationship.</E> The opinion of a physician who has treated the miner for respiratory or pulmonary conditions is entitled to more weight than a physician who has treated the miner for non-respiratory conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duration of relationship.</E> The length of the treatment relationship demonstrates whether the physician has observed the miner long enough to obtain a superior understanding of his or her condition;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Frequency of treatment.</E> The frequency of physician-patient visits demonstrates whether the physician has observed the miner often enough to obtain a superior understanding of his or her condition; and</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Extent of treatment.</E> The types of testing and examinations conducted during the treatment relationship demonstrate whether the physician has obtained superior and relevant information concerning the miner's condition.</P>
              <P>(5) In the absence of contrary probative evidence, the adjudication officer shall accept the statement of a physician with regard to the factors listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section. In appropriate cases, the relationship between the miner and his treating physician may constitute substantial evidence in support of the adjudication officer's decision to give that physician's opinion controlling weight, provided that the weight given to the opinion of a miner's treating physician shall also be based on the credibility of the physician's opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation, other relevant evidence and the record as a whole.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Arterial blood-gas studies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Blood-gas studies are performed to detect an impairment in the process of alveolar gas exchange. This defect will manifest itself primarily as a fall in arterial oxygen tension either at rest or during exercise. No blood-gas study shall be performed if medically contraindicated.</P>
              <P>(b) A blood-gas study shall initially be administered at rest and in a sitting position. If the results of the blood-gas test at rest do not satisfy the requirements of Appendix C to this part, an exercise blood-gas test shall be offered to the miner unless medically contraindicated. If an exercise blood-gas test is administered, blood shall be drawn during exercise.</P>
              <P>(c) Any report of a blood-gas study submitted in connection with a claim shall specify:</P>
              <P>(1) Date and time of test;</P>
              <P>(2) Altitude and barometric pressure at which the test was conducted;</P>

              <P>(6) The recorded values for PC02, P02, and PH, which have been collected simultaneously (specify values at rest and, if performed, during exercise);</P>
              <P>(7) Duration and type of exercise;</P>
              <P>(8) Pulse rate at the time the blood sample was drawn;</P>
              <P>(9) Time between drawing of sample and analysis of sample; and</P>
              <P>(10) Whether equipment was calibrated before and after each test.</P>
              <P>(d) If one or more blood-gas studies producing results which meet the appropriate table in Appendix C is administered during a hospitalization which ends in the miner's death, then any such study must be accompanied by a physician's report establishing that the test results were produced by a chronic respiratory or pulmonary condition. Failure to produce such a report will prevent reliance on the blood-gas study as evidence that the miner was totally disabled at death. (e) In the case of a deceased miner, where no blood gas tests are in substantial compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), noncomplying tests may form the basis for a finding if, in the opinion of the adjudication officer, the only available tests demonstrate technically valid results. This provision shall not excuse compliance with the requirements in paragraph (d) for any blood gas study administered during a hospitalization which ends in the miner's death.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definition of pneumoconiosis.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For the purpose of the Act, “pneumoconiosis” means a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment. This definition includes both medical, or “clinical”, pneumoconiosis and statutory, or “legal”, pneumoconiosis.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Clinical Pneumoconiosis.</E> “Clinical pneumoconiosis” consists of those diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconioses, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment. This definition includes, but is not limited to, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, anthracosilicosis, anthracosis, anthrosilicosis, massive pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis or silicotuberculosis, arising out of coal mine employment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Legal Pneumoconiosis.</E> “Legal pneumoconiosis” includes any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment. This definition includes, but is not limited to, any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, a disease “arising out of coal mine employment” includes any chronic pulmonary disease or respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of this definition, “pneumoconiosis” is recognized as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determining the existence of pneumoconiosis.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis may be made as follows in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:</P>

              <P>(1) A chest X-ray conducted and classified in accordance with § 718.102 may form the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis. Except as otherwise provided in this section, where two or more X-ray reports are in conflict, in evaluating such X-ray reports consideration must be given to the radiological qualifications of the physicians interpreting such X-rays (<E T="03">see</E> § 718.102(d)).</P>
              <P>(2) A biopsy or autopsy conducted and reported in compliance with § 718.106 may be the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis. A finding in an autopsy or biopsy of anthracotic pigmentation, however, must not be considered sufficient, by itself, to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis. A report of autopsy must be accepted unless there is evidence that the report is not accurate or that the claim has been fraudulently represented.</P>
              <P>(3) If the presumptions described in § 718.304 or § 718.305 are applicable, it must be presumed that the miner is or was suffering from pneumoconiosis.</P>
              <P>(4) A determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis may also be made if a physician, exercising sound medical judgment, notwithstanding a negative X-ray, finds that the miner suffers or suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in § 718.201. Any such finding must be based on objective medical evidence such as blood-gas studies, electrocardiograms, pulmonary function studies, physical performance tests, physical examination, and medical and work histories. Such a finding must be supported by a reasoned medical opinion.</P>
              <P>(b) A claim for benefits must not be denied solely on the basis of a negative chest X-ray.</P>
              <P>(c) A determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis must not be made—</P>
              <P>(1) Solely on the basis of a living miner's statements or testimony; or</P>

              <P>(2) In a claim involving a deceased miner, solely on the basis of the affidavit(s) (or equivalent testimony) of <PRTPAGE P="488"/>the claimant and/or his or her dependents who would be eligible for augmentation of the claimant's benefits if the claim were approved.</P>

              <P>(a) In order for a claimant to be found eligible for benefits under the Act, it must be determined that the miner's pneumoconiosis arose at least in part out of coal mine employment. The provisions in this section set forth the criteria to be applied in making such a determination.</P>

              <P>(c) If a miner who is suffering or suffered from pneumoconiosis was employed less than ten years in the nation's coal mines, it shall be determined that such pneumoconiosis arose out of that employment only if competent evidence establishes such a relationship.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Benefits are provided under the Act for or on behalf of miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, or who were totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis at the time of death. For purposes of this section, any nonpulmonary or nonrespiratory condition or disease, which causes an independent disability unrelated to the miner's pulmonary or respiratory disability, shall not be considered in determining whether a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis. If, however, a nonpulmonary or nonrespiratory condition or disease causes a chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment, that condition or disease shall be considered in determining whether the miner is or was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Total disability defined.</E> A miner shall be considered totally disabled if the irrebuttable presumption described in § 718.304 applies. If that presumption does not apply, a miner shall be considered totally disabled if the miner has a pulmonary or respiratory impairment which, standing alone, prevents or prevented the miner:</P>
              <P>(i) From performing his or her usual coal mine work; and</P>
              <P>(ii) From engaging in gainful employment in the immediate area of his or her residence requiring the skills or abilities comparable to those of any employment in a mine or mines in which he or she previously engaged with some regularity over a substantial period of time.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Medical criteria.</E> In the absence of contrary probative evidence, evidence which meets the standards of either paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section shall establish a miner's total disability:</P>
              <P>(i) Pulmonary function tests showing values equal to or less than those listed in Table B1 (Males) or Table B2 (Females) in Appendix B to this part for an individual of the miner's age, sex, and height for the FEV1 test; if, in addition, such tests also reveal the values specified in either paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) or (C) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) Values equal to or less than those listed in Table B3 (Males) or Table B4 (Females) in Appendix B of this part, for an individual of the miner's age, sex, and height for the FVC test, or</P>
              <P>(B) Values equal to or less than those listed in Table B5 (Males) or Table B6 (Females) in Appendix B to this part, for an individual of the miner's age, sex, and height for the MVV test, or</P>
              <P>(C) A percentage of 55 or less when the results of the FEV1 test are divided by the results of the FVC test (FEV1/FVC equal to or less than 55%), or</P>
              <P>(ii) Arterial blood-gas tests show the values listed in Appendix C to this part, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The miner has pneumoconiosis and has been shown by the medical evidence to be suffering from cor pulmonale with right-sided congestive heart failure, or</P>

              <P>(iv) Where total disability cannot be shown under paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, or where pulmonary function tests and/or blood gas studies are medically contraindicated, total disability may nevertheless be <PRTPAGE P="489"/>found if a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, based on medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, concludes that a miner's respiratory or pulmonary condition prevents or prevented the miner from engaging in employment as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Total disability due to pneumoconiosis defined.</E> A miner shall be considered totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if pneumoconiosis, as defined in § 718.201, is a substantially contributing cause of the miner's totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. Pneumoconiosis is a “substantially contributing cause” of the miner's disability if it:</P>
              <P>(i) Has a material adverse effect on the miner's respiratory or pulmonary condition; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Materially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment which is caused by a disease or exposure unrelated to coal mine employment.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in § 718.305 and paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, proof that the miner suffers or suffered from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iv) and (d) of this section shall not, by itself, be sufficient to establish that the miner's impairment is or was due to pneumoconiosis. Except as provided in paragraph (d), the cause or causes of a miner's total disability shall be established by means of a physician's documented and reasoned medical report.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Lay evidence.</E> In establishing total disability, lay evidence may be used in the following cases:</P>
              <P>(1) In a case involving a deceased miner in which the claim was filed prior to January 1, 1982, affidavits (or equivalent sworn testimony) from persons knowledgeable of the miner's physical condition shall be sufficient to establish total (or under § 718.306 partial) disability due to pneumoconiosis if no medical or other relevant evidence exists which addresses the miner's pulmonary or respiratory condition.</P>
              <P>(2) In a case involving a survivor's claim filed on or after January 1, 1982, but prior to June 30, 1982, which is subject to § 718.306, affidavits (or equivalent sworn testimony) from persons knowledgeable of the miner's physical condition shall be sufficient to establish total or partial disability due to pneumoconiosis if no medical or other relevant evidence exists which addresses the miner's pulmonary or respiratory condition; however, such a determination shall not be based solely upon the affidavits or testimony of the claimant and/or his or her dependents who would be eligible for augmentation of the claimant's benefits if the claim were approved.</P>
              <P>(3) In a case involving a deceased miner whose claim was filed on or after January 1, 1982, affidavits (or equivalent sworn testimony) from persons knowledgeable of the miner's physical condition shall be sufficient to establish total disability due to pneumoconiosis if no medical or other relevant evidence exists which addresses the miner's pulmonary or respiratory condition; however, such a determination shall not be based solely upon the affidavits or testimony of any person who would be eligible for benefits (including augmented benefits) if the claim were approved.</P>
              <P>(4) Statements made before death by a deceased miner about his or her physical condition are relevant and shall be considered in making a determination as to whether the miner was totally disabled at the time of death.</P>
              <P>(5) In the case of a living miner's claim, a finding of total disability due to pneumoconiosis shall not be made solely on the miner's statements or testimony.</P>
              <P>(e) In determining total disability to perform usual coal mine work, the following shall apply in evaluating the miner's employment activities:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a deceased miner, employment in a mine at the time of death shall not be conclusive evidence that the miner was not totally disabled. To disprove total disability, it must be shown that at the time the miner died, there were no changed circumstances of employment indicative of his or her reduced ability to perform his or her usual coal mine work.</P>

              <P>(2) In the case of a living miner, proof of current employment in a coal mine <PRTPAGE P="490"/>shall not be conclusive evidence that the miner is not totally disabled unless it can be shown that there are no changed circumstances of employment indicative of his or her reduced ability to perform his or her usual coal mine work.</P>
              <P>(3) Changed circumstances of employment indicative of a miner's reduced ability to perform his or her usual coal mine work may include but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) The miner's reduced ability to perform his or her customary duties without help; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The miner's reduced ability to perform his or her customary duties at his or her usual levels of rapidity, continuity or efficiency; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The miner's transfer by request or assignment to less vigorous duties or to duties in a less dusty part of the mine.</P>

              <P>(a) Benefits are provided to eligible survivors of a miner whose death was due to pneumoconiosis. In order to receive benefits based on a showing of death due to pneumoconiosis, a claimant must prove that:</P>
              <P>(1) The miner had pneumoconiosis (<E T="03">see</E> § 718.202);</P>

              <P>(2) The miner's pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment (<E T="03">see</E> § 718.203); and</P>
              <P>(3) The miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis as provided by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Death will be considered to be due to pneumoconiosis if any of the following criteria is met:</P>
              <P>(1) Where competent medical evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was the cause of the miner's death, or</P>
              <P>(2) Where pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner's death or where the death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis, or</P>
              <P>(3) Where the presumption set forth at § 718.304 is applicable, or</P>
              <P>(4) For survivors' claims filed after January 1, 2005, and pending on or after March 23, 2010, where the presumption at § 718.305 is invoked and not rebutted.</P>
              <P>(5) However, except where the § 718.304 presumption is invoked, survivors are not eligible for benefits where the miner's death was caused by a traumatic injury (including suicide) or the principal cause of death was a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis, unless the claimant establishes (by proof or presumption) that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of death.</P>
              <P>(6) Pneumoconiosis is a “substantially contributing cause” of a miner's death if it hastens the miner's death.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 718—Standards for Administration and Interpretation of Chest Radiographs (X-rays)</HD>
              <P>The following standards are established in accordance with sections 402(f)(1)(D) and 413(b) of the Act. They were developed in consultation with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Department of Health and Human Services. These standards are promulgated for the guidance of physicians and medical technicians to ensure that uniform procedures are used in administering and interpreting X-rays and that the best available medical evidence will be submitted in connection with a claim for black lung benefits. If it is established that one or more standards have not been met, the claims adjudicator may consider such fact in determining the evidentiary weight to be assigned to the physician's report of an X-ray.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) <E T="03">Digital radiography systems,</E> as used in this context, include both digital radiography (DR) and computed radiography (CR). Digital radiography is the term used for digital X-ray image acquisition systems in which the X-ray signals received by the image detector are converted nearly instantaneously to electronic signals without moveable cassettes. Computed radiography is the term for digital X-ray image acquisition systems that detect X-ray signals using a cassette-based photostimulable storage phosphor. Subsequently, the cassette is processed using a stimulating laser beam to convert the latent radiographic image to electronic signals which are then processed and stored so they can be displayed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Qualified medical physicist</E> means an individual who is trained in evaluating the performance of radiographic equipment including radiation controls and facility quality assurance programs, and has the relevant current certification by a competent U.S. national board, or unrestricted license or approval from a U.S. State or Territory.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Radiographic technique chart</E> means a table that specifies the types of cassette, intensifying screen, film or digital detector, grid, filter, and lists X-ray machine settings (timing, kVp, mA) that enables the radiographer to select the correct settings based on the body habitus or the thickness of the chest tissue.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Radiologic technologist</E> means an individual who has met the requirements for privileges to perform general radiographic procedures and for competence in using the equipment and software employed by the examining facility to obtain chest images as specified by the State or Territory and examining facility in which such services are provided. Optimally, such an individual will have completed a formal training program in radiography leading to a certificate, an associate's degree, or a bachelor's degree and participated in the voluntary initial certification and annual renewal of registration for radiologic technologists offered by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Soft copy</E> means the image of a coal miner's chest radiograph acquired using a digital radiography system, viewed at the full resolution of the image acquisition system using an electronic medical image display device.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> (1) Facilities must maintain ongoing licensure and certification under relevant local, State, and Federal laws and regulations for all digital equipment and related processes covered by this Appendix. Radiographic equipment, its use and the facilities (including mobile facilities) in which such equipment is used must conform to applicable State or Territorial and Federal regulations. Where no applicable regulations exist regarding reducing the risk from ionizing radiation exposure in the clinical setting, radiographic equipment, its use and the facilities (including mobile facilities) in which such equipment is used should conform to the recommendations in NCRP Report No. 102, NCRP Report No. 105, and NCRP Report No. 147 (incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 718.5).</P>

              <P>(3) Miners must be disrobed from the waist up at the time the radiograph is given. The facility must provide a dressing area and for those miners who wish to use one, the facility will provide a clean gown. Facilities must be heated to a comfortable temperature.</P>
              <P>(4) Before the miner is advised that the examination is concluded, the radiograph must be processed and inspected and accepted for quality standards by the physician, or if the physician is not available, acceptance may be made by the radiologic technologist.

              <P>(viii) The geometry of the radiographic system must ensure that the central axis (ray) of the primary beam is perpendicular to the plane of the film surface and impinges on the center of the film.</P>
              <P>(8) Radiographic processing:</P>

The storage phosphor cassette or digital image detector must be positioned either vertically or horizontally so that the image includes the apices and costophrenic angles of both right and left lungs. If the detector cannot include the apices and costophrenic angles of both lungs as described, then the two side-by-side images can be obtained that together include the apices and costophrenic angles of both right and left lungs.</P>
              <P>(2) Radiographs must be made with a diagnostic X-ray machine with a maximum actual (not nominal) source (focal spot) of 2 mm, as measured in two orthogonal directions.</P>

The beam limiting device must provide rectangular collimation. Electronic post-image acquisition “shutters” available on some CR or DR systems that limit the size of the final image and that simulate collimator limits must not be used. The use and effect of the beam limiting device must be discernible on the resulting image.</P>
              <P>(6) Radiographic technique charts must be used that are developed specifically for the X-ray system and detector combinations used, indicating exposure parameters by anatomic measurements.</P>
              <P>(7) To ensure high quality chest radiographs:</P>
              <P>(i) The maximum exposure time must not exceed 50 milliseconds except for subjects with chests over 28 cm posteroanterior, for whom the exposure time must not exceed 100 milliseconds.</P>
              <P>(ii) The distance from source or focal spot to detector must be at least 70 inches (or 180 centimeters if measured in centimeters).</P>

              <P>(iii) The exposure setting for chest images must be within the range of 100-300 equivalent exposure speeds and must comply with ACR Practice Guidelines for Diagnostic Reference Levels in Medical X-ray Imaging, Section V—Diagnostic Reference Levels for Imaging with Ionizing Radiation and Section VII-Radiation Safety in Imaging (incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 718.5).

Image management software and settings for routine chest imaging must be used, including routine amplification of digital detector signal as well as standard image post-processing functions. Image or edge enhancement software functions must not be employed unless they are integral to the digital radiography system (not elective); in such cases, only the minimum image enhancement permitted by the system may be employed.</P>

              <P>(v)(A) The image object, transmission and associated data storage, film format, and transmissions of associated information must conform to the following components of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard (incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 718.5):</P>

Modification of the appearance of the standard images using software tools is not permitted.</P>
              <P>(14) Viewing systems should enable readers to display the coal miner's chest image at the full resolution of the image acquisition system, side-by-side with the selected ILO standard images for comparison.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 718—Standards for Administration and Interpretation of Pulmonary Function Tests. Tables B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6.</HD>
              <P>The following standards are established in accordance with section 402(f)(1)(D) of the Act. They were developed in consultation with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These standards are promulgated for the guidance of physicians and medical technicians to insure that uniform procedures are used in administering and interpreting ventilatory function tests and that the best available medical evidence will be submitted in support of a claim for black lung benefits. If it is established that one or more standards have not been met, the claims adjudicator may consider such fact in determining the evidentiary weight to be given to the results of the ventilatory function tests.</P>

              <P>(1) Instruments to be used for the administration of pulmonary function tests shall be approved by NIOSH and shall conform to the following criteria:<PRTPAGE P="496"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The instrument shall be accurate within ±50 ml or within ±3 percent of reading, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(ii) The instrument shall be capable of measuring vital capacity from 0 to 7 liters BTPS.</P>
              <P>(iii) The instrument shall have a low inertia and offer low resistance to airflow such that the resistance to airflow at 12 liters per second must be less than 1.5 cm H20/liter/sec.</P>
              <P>(iv) The instrument or user of the instrument must have a means of correcting volumes to body temperature saturated with water vapor (BTPS) under conditions of varying ambient spirometer temperatures and barometric pressures.</P>
              <P>(v) The instrument used shall provide a tracing of flow versus volume (flow-volume loop) which displays the entire maximum inspiration and the entire maximum forced expiration. The instrument shall, in addition, provide tracings of the volume versus time tracing (spirogram) derived electronically from the flow-volume loop. Tracings are necessary to determine whether maximum inspiratory and expiratory efforts have been obtained during the FVC maneuver. If maximum voluntary ventilation is measured, the tracing shall record the individual breaths volumes versus time.</P>
              <P>(vi) The instrument shall be capable of accumulating volume for a minimum of 10 seconds after the onset of exhalation.</P>
              <P>(vii) The instrument must be capable of being calibrated in the field with respect to the FEV1. The volume calibration shall be accomplished with a 3 L calibrating syringe and should agree to within 1 percent of a 3 L calibrating volume. The linearity of the instrument must be documented by a record of volume calibrations at three different flow rates of approximately 3 L/6 sec, 3 L/3 sec, and 3 L/sec.</P>
              <P>(viii) For measuring maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) the instrument shall have a response which is flat within ±10 percent up to 4 Hz at flow rates up to 12 liters per second over the volume range.</P>
              <P>(ix) The spirogram shall be recorded at a speed of at least 20 mm/sec and a volume excursion of at least 10mm/L. Calculation of the FEVl from the flow-volume loop is not acceptable. Original tracings shall be submitted.</P>
              <P>(2) The administration of pulmonary function tests shall conform to the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Tests shall not be performed during or soon after an acute respiratory illness.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the FEV1 and FVC, use of a nose clip is required. The procedures shall be explained in simple terms to the patient who shall be instructed to loosen any tight clothing and stand in front of the apparatus. The subject may sit, or stand, but care should be taken on repeat testing that the same position be used. Particular attention shall be given to insure that the chin is slightly elevated with the neck slightly extended. The subject shall be instructed to expire completely, momentarily hold his breath, place the mouthpiece in his mouth and close the mouth firmly about the mouthpiece to ensure no air leak. The subject will than make a maximum inspiration from the instrument and when maximum inspiration has been attained, without interruption, blow as hard, fast and completely as possible for at least 7 seconds or until a plateau has been attained in the volume-time curve with no detectable change in the expired volume during the last 2 seconds of maximal expiratory effort. A minimum of three flow-volume loops and derived spirometric tracings shall be carried out. The patient shall be observed throughout the study for compliance with instructions. Inspiration and expiration shall be checked visually for reproducibility. The effort shall be judged unacceptable when the patient:</P>
              <P>(A) Has not reached full inspiration preceding the forced expiration; or</P>
              <P>(B) Has not used maximal effort during the entire forced expiration; or</P>
              <P>(C) Has not continued the expiration for least 7 sec. or until an obvious plateau for at least 2 sec. in the volume-time curve has occurred; or</P>
              <P>(D) Has coughed or closed his glottis; or</P>
              <P>(E) Has an obstructed mouthpiece or a leak around the mouthpiece (obstruction due to tongue being placed in front of mouthpiece, false teeth falling in front of mouthpiece, etc.); or</P>
              <P>(F) Has an unsatisfactory start of expiration, one characterized by excessive hesitation (or false starts). Peak flow should be attained at the start of expiration and the volume-time tracing (spirogram) should have a smooth contour revealing gradually decreasing flow throughout expiration; or</P>
              <P>(G) Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. The variation between the two largest FEV1's of the three acceptable tracings should not exceed 5 percent of the largest FEV1 or 100 ml, whichever is greater. As individuals with obstructive disease or rapid decline in lung function will be less likely to achieve this degree of reproducibility, tests not meeting this criterion may still be submitted for consideration in support of a claim for black lung benefits. Failure to meet this standard should be clearly noted in the test report by the physician conducting or reviewing the test.</P>

              <P>(iii) For the MVV, the subject shall be instructed before beginning the test that he or she will be asked to breathe as deeply and as rapidly as possible for approximately 15 seconds. The test shall be performed with the subject in the standing position, if possible. Care shall be taken on repeat testing that the same position be used. The subject shall breathe normally into the mouthpiece of the <PRTPAGE P="497"/>apparatus for 10 to 15 seconds to become accustomed to the system. The subject shall then be instructed to breathe as deeply and as rapidly as possible, and shall be continually encouraged during the remainder of the maneuver. Subject shall continue the maneuver for 15 seconds. At least 5 minutes of rest shall be allowed between maneuvers. At least three MVV's shall be carried out. (<E T="03">But see</E> § 718.103(b).) During the maneuvers the patient shall be observed for compliance with instructions. The effort shall be judged unacceptable when the patient:</P>
              <P>(A) Has not maintained consistent effort for at least 12 to 15 seconds; or</P>
              <P>(B) Has coughed or closed his glottis; or</P>
              <P>(C) Has an obstructed mouthpiece or a leak around the mouthpiece (obstruction due to tongue being placed in front of mouthpiece, false teeth falling in front of mouthpiece, etc.); or</P>
              <P>(D) Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. The variation between the two largest MVVs of the three satisfactory tracings shall not exceed 10 percent.</P>
              <P>(iv) A calibration check shall be performed on the instrument each day before use, using a volume source of at least three liters, accurate to within ±1 percent of full scale. The volume calibration shall be performed in accordance with the method described in paragraph (1)(vii) of this Appendix. Accuracy of the time measurement used in determining the FEV1 shall be checked using the manufacturer's stated procedure and shall be within ±3 percent of actual. The procedure described in the Appendix shall be performed as well as any other procedures suggested by the manufacturer of the spirometer being used.</P>
              <P>(v)(A) The first step in evaluating a spirogram for the FVC and FEV1 shall be to determine whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as described in (2)(ii) of this Appendix. The largest recorded FVC and FEV1, corrected to BTPS, shall be used in the analysis.</P>
              <P>(B) Only MVV maneuvers which demonstrate consistent effort for at least 12 seconds shall be considered acceptable. The largest accumulated volume for a 12 second period corrected to BTPS and multiplied by five or the largest accumulated volume for a 15 second period corrected to BTPS and multiplied by four is to be reported as the MVV.</P>

              <P>The following tables set forth the values to be applied in determining whether total disability may be established in accordance with § 718.204(b)(2)(ii). The values contained in the tables are indicative of impairment only. They do not establish a degree of disability except as provided in § 718.204(b)(2)(ii) of this subchapter, nor do they establish standards for determining normal alveolar gas exchange values for any particular individual. Tests must not be performed during or soon after an acute respiratory or cardiac illness. A miner who meets the following medical specifications must be found to be totally disabled, in the absence of rebutting evidence, if the values specified in one of the following tables are met:<PRTPAGE P="510"/>

            <SECTNO>§ 722.1</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Section 421 of the Black Lung Benefits Act provides that a claim for benefits based on the total disability or death of a coal miner due to pneumoconiosis must be filed under a State workers' compensation law where such law provides adequate coverage for pneumoconiosis. A State workers' compensation law may be deemed to provide adequate coverage only when it is included on a list of such laws maintained by the Secretary. The purpose of this part is to set forth the procedures and criteria for inclusion on that list, and to provide that list.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The definitions and use of terms contained in subpart A of part 725 of this title shall be applicable to this part.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:<PRTPAGE P="511"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">State agency</E> means, with respect to any State, the agency, department or officer designated by the workers' compensation law of the State to administer such law. In any case in which more than one agency participates in the administration of a State workers' compensation law, the Governor of the State may designate which of the agencies shall be the State agency for purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">The Secretary's list</E> means the list published by the Secretary of Labor in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (see § 722.4) containing the names of those States which have in effect a workers' compensation law which provides adequate coverage for death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 722.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General criteria; inclusion in and removal from the Secretary's list.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Governor of any State or any duly authorized State agency may, at any time, request that the Secretary include such State's workers' compensation law on his list of those State workers' compensation laws providing adequate coverage for total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis. Each such request shall include a copy of the State workers' compensation law and any other pertinent State laws; a copy of any regulations, either proposed or promulgated, implementing such laws; and a copy of any relevant administrative or court decision interpreting such laws or regulations, or, if such decisions are published in a readily available report, a citation to such decision.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon receipt of a request that a State be included on the Secretary's list, the Secretary shall include the State on the list if he finds that the State's workers' compensation law guarantees the payment of monthly and medical benefits to all persons who would be entitled to such benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act at the time of the request, at a rate no less than that provided by the Black Lung Benefits Act. The criteria used by the Secretary in making such determination shall include, but shall not be limited to, the criteria set forth in section 421(b)(2) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) The Secretary may require each State included on the list to submit reports detailing the extent to which the State's workers' compensation laws, as reflected by statute, regulation, or administrative or court decision, continues to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the Secretary concludes that the State's workers' compensation law does not provide adequate coverage at any time, either because of changes to the State workers' compensation law or the Black Lung Benefits Act, he shall remove the State from the Secretary's list after providing the State with notice of such removal and an opportunity to be heard.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 722.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>The Secretary's list.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Secretary has determined that publication of the Secretary's list in the Code of Federal Regulations is appropriate. Accordingly, in addition to its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as required by section 421 of the Black Lung Benefits Act, the list shall also appear in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon review of all requests filed with the Secretary under section 421 of the Black Lung Benefits Act and this part, and examination of the workers' compensation laws of the States making such requests, the Secretary has determined that the workers' compensation law of each of the following listed States, for the period from the date shown in the list until such date as the Secretary may make a contrary determination, provides adequate coverage for pneumoconiosis.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 725.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Statutory provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Subchapter IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977, the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977, the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981, the Black Lung Consolidation of Responsibility Act of 2002, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (together comprising the Black Lung Benefits Act (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.101(a)(1)) provides for the payment of benefits to certain disabled coal miners and their survivors. <E T="03">See</E> § 725.201.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Part B.</E> Part B of subchapter IV of the Act provided that claims filed before July 1, 1973 were to be filed with, and adjudicated and administered by, the Social Security Administration (SSA). If awarded, these claims were paid by SSA out of appropriated funds. The Black Lung Consolidation of Administrative Responsibility Act (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (h) of this section) transferred all responsibility for continued administration of these claims to the Department of Labor.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Part C.</E> Claims filed by a miner or survivor on or after January 1, 1974, are filed, adjudicated, and paid under the provisions of part C of subchapter IV of the Act. Part C requires that a claim filed on or after January 1, 1974, shall be filed under an applicable approved State workers' compensation law, or if no such law has been approved by the Secretary of Labor, the claim may be filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 422 of the Act. Claims filed with the Secretary of Labor under part <PRTPAGE P="515"/>C are processed and adjudicated by the Secretary. Individual coal mine operators are primarily liable for benefits; however, if the miner's last coal mine employment terminated before January 1, 1970, or if no responsible operator can be identified, benefits are paid by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Claims adjudicated under part C are subject to certain incorporated provisions of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Changes made by the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977.</E> The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 contains a number of significant amendments to the Act's standards for determining eligibility for benefits. Among these are:</P>
              <P>(1) A provision which clarifies the definition of “pneumoconiosis” to include any “chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment”;</P>
              <P>(2) A provision which defines “miner” to include any person who works or has worked in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility, and in coal mine construction or coal transportation under certain circumstances;</P>
              <P>(3) A provision that continued employment in a coal mine is not conclusive proof that a miner is not or was not totally disabled;</P>
              <P>(4) A provision which authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish standards and develop criteria for determining total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis with respect to a part C claim;</P>
              <P>(5) Provisions relating to the treatment to be accorded a survivor's affidavit, certain X-ray interpretations, and certain autopsy reports in the development of a claim; and</P>
              <P>(6) Other clarifying, procedural, and technical amendments.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Changes made by the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977.</E> The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 established the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund which is financed by a specified tax imposed upon each ton of coal (except lignite) produced and sold or used in the United States after March 31, 1978. The Secretary of the Treasury is the managing trustee of the fund and benefits are paid from the fund upon the direction of the Secretary of Labor. The fund was made liable for the payment of all claims approved under part C of the Act for all periods of eligibility occurring on or after January 1, 1974, with respect to claims where the miner's last coal mine employment terminated before January 1, 1970, or where individual liability can not be assessed against a coal mine operator due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or the like. The fund was also authorized to pay certain claims which a responsible operator has refused to pay within a reasonable time, and to seek reimbursement from such operator. The purpose of the fund and the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 was to insure that coal mine operators, or the coal industry, will fully bear the cost of black lung disease for the present time and in the future. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 also contained other provisions relating to the fund and authorized a coal mine operator to establish its own trust fund for the payment of certain claims.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Changes made by the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981.</E> The Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981 made a number of significant changes in the Act's standards for determining eligibility for benefits and concerning the payment of such benefits, and applied the changes to claims filed on or after January 1, 1982. Among these are:</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary of Labor may re-read any X-ray submitted in support of a claim and may rely upon a second opinion concerning such an X-ray as a means of auditing the validity of the claim;</P>

              <P>(2) The rebuttable presumption that the total disability of a miner with fifteen or more years employment in the coal mines, who has demonstrated a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, is due to pneumoconiosis is no longer applicable (but the presumption was reinstated for claims filed after January 1, 2005, and pending on or after March 23, 2010, by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (i) of this section));</P>

              <P>(3) In the case of deceased miners, where no medical or other relevant evidence is available, only affidavits from <PRTPAGE P="516"/>persons not eligible to receive benefits as a result of the adjudication of the claim will be considered sufficient to establish entitlement to benefits;</P>

              <P>(4) Unless the miner was found entitled to benefits as a result of a claim filed prior to January 1, 1982, benefits are payable on survivors' claims filed on and after January 1, 1982, only when the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis (but for survivors' claims filed after January 1, 2005, and pending on or after March 23, 2010, an award of a miner's claim may form the basis for a survivor's entitlement under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (i) of this section));</P>
              <P>(5) Benefits payable under this part are subject to an offset on account of excess earnings by the miner; and</P>
              <P>(6) Other technical amendments.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Changes made by the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981.</E> The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 temporarily doubles the amount of the tax upon coal until the fund has repaid all advances received from the United States Treasury and the interest on all such advances. With respect to claims filed on or after January 1, 1982, the fund's authorization for the payment of interim benefits is limited to the payment of prospective benefits only. These changes also define the rates of interest to be paid to and by the fund.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Changes made by the Black Lung Consolidation of Administrative Responsibility Act.</E> The Black Lung Consolidation of Administrative Responsibility Act of 2002 transferred administrative responsibility for all claims previously filed with or administered by the Social Security Administration to the Department of Labor, effective January 31, 2003. As a result, certain obsolete provisions in the BLBA (30 U.S.C. 904, 924a, and 945) were repealed. Various technical changes were made to other statutory provisions.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.</E> The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the ACA) changed the entitlement criteria for miners' and survivors' claims filed after January 1, 2005, and pending on or after March 23, 2010, by reinstating two provisions made inapplicable by the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981.</P>
              <P>(1) For miners' claims meeting these date requirements, the ACA reinstated the rebuttable presumption that the miner is (or was) totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if the miner has (or had) 15 or more years of qualifying coal mine employment and a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.</P>
              <P>(2) For survivors' claims meeting these date requirements, the ACA made two changes. First, it reinstated the rebuttable presumption that the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis if the miner had 15 years or more of qualifying coal mine employment and was totally disabled by a respiratory or pulmonary impairment at the time of death. Second, it reinstituted derivative survivors' entitlement. As a result, an eligible survivor will be entitled to benefits if the miner is or was found entitled to benefits on his or her lifetime claim based on total disability due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal-mine employment.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Longshore Act provisions.</E> The adjudication of claims filed under part C of the Act (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> claims filed on or after January 1, 1974) is governed by various procedural and other provisions contained in the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), as amended from time to time, which are incorporated within the Act by section 422. The incorporated LHWCA provisions are applicable under the Act except as is otherwise provided by the Act or as provided by regulations of the Secretary. Although occupational disease benefits are also payable under the LHWCA, the primary focus of the procedures set forth in that Act is upon a time-definite-traumatic injury or death. Because of this and other significant differences between a black lung and longshore claim, it is determined, in accordance with the authority set forth in Section 422 of the Act, that certain of the incorporated procedures prescribed by the LHWCA must be altered to fit the circumstances ordinarily confronted in the adjudication of a black lung claim. The changes made are based upon the Department's experience in processing black lung claims since July 1, 1973, and all such changes are specified in this part. No <PRTPAGE P="517"/>other departure from the incorporated provisions of the LHWCA is intended.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Social Security Act provisions.</E> Section 402 of Part A of the Act incorporates certain definitional provisions from the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 301 <E T="03">et seq.</E> Section 430 provides that the 1972, 1977 and 1981 amendments to part B of the Act shall also apply to part C “to the extent appropriate.” Sections 412 and 413 incorporate various provisions of the Social Security Act into part B of the Act. To the extent appropriate, therefore, these provisions also apply to part C. In certain cases, the Department has varied the terms of the Social Security Act provisions to accommodate the unique needs of the black lung benefits program. Parts of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act are also incorporated into part C. Where the incorporated provisions of the two acts are inconsistent, the Department has exercised its broad regulatory powers to choose the extent to which each incorporation is appropriate. Finally, Section 422(g), contained in part C of the Act, incorporates 42 U.S.C. 403(b)-(l).</P>

The version of those sections set forth in 20 CFR, parts 500 to end, edition revised as of April 1, 1999, apply to the adjudications of claims that were pending on January 19, 2001. For purposes of construing the provisions of this section, a claim will be considered pending on January 19, 2001 if it was not finally denied more than one year prior to that date.</P>

Claims filed after March 31, 1980, are subject to part 718 as promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 402(f)(1) of the Act on February 29, 1980 (see § 725.2(c)). The criteria contained in subpart C of part 727 of this subchapter are applicable in determining claims filed prior to April 1, 1980, under this part, and such criteria shall be applicable at all times with respect to claims filed under this part and under section 11 of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977.</P>

              <P>(29) <E T="03">Total disability</E> and <E T="03">partial disability,</E> for purposes of this part, have the meaning given them as provided in part 718 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(30) <E T="03">Underground coal mine</E> means a coal mine in which the earth and other materials which lie above and around the natural deposit of coal (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, overburden) are not removed in mining; including all land, structures, facilities, machinery, tools, equipment, shafts, slopes, tunnels, excavations and other property, real or personal, appurtenant thereto.</P>
              <P>(31) A <E T="03">workers' compensation law</E> means a law providing for payment of benefits to employees, and their dependents and survivors, for disability on account of injury, including occupational disease, or death, suffered in connection with their employment. A payment funded wholly out of general revenues shall not be considered a payment under a workers' compensation law.</P>
              <P>(32) <E T="03">Year</E> means a period of one calendar year (365 days, or 366 days if one of the days is February 29), or partial periods totaling one year, during which the miner worked in or around a coal mine or mines for at least 125 “working days.” A “working day” means any day or part of a day for which a miner received pay for work as a miner, but shall not include any day for which the miner received pay while on an approved absence, such as vacation or sick leave. In determining whether a miner worked for one year, any day for which the miner received pay while on an approved absence, such as vacation or sick leave, may be counted as part of the calendar year and as partial periods totaling one year.</P>
              <P>(i) If the evidence establishes that the miner worked in or around coal mines at least 125 working days during a calendar year or partial periods totaling one year, then the miner has worked one year in coal mine employment for all purposes under the Act. If a miner worked fewer than 125 working days in a year, he or she has worked a fractional year based on the ratio of the actual number of days worked to 125. Proof that the miner worked more than 125 working days in a calendar year or partial periods totaling a year, does not establish more than one year.</P>

              <P>(ii) To the extent the evidence permits, the beginning and ending dates of all periods of coal mine employment must be ascertained. The dates and length of employment may be established by any credible evidence including (but not limited to) company records, pension records, earnings statements, coworker affidavits, and sworn testimony. If the evidence establishes that the miner's employment <PRTPAGE P="521"/>lasted for a calendar year or partial periods totaling a 365-day period amounting to one year, it must be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the miner spent at least 125 working days in such employment.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the evidence is insufficient to establish the beginning and ending dates of the miner's coal mine employment, or the miner's employment lasted less than a calendar year, then the adjudication officer may use the following formula: divide the miner's yearly income from work as a miner by the coal mine industry's average daily earnings for that year, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A copy of the BLS table must be made a part of the record if the adjudication officer uses this method to establish the length of the miner's work history.</P>
              <P>(iv) Periods of coal mine employment occurring outside the United States must not be considered in computing the miner's work history.</P>

                <P>(2) A student will be considered to be “pursuing a full-time course of study or training at an institution” if the student is enrolled in a noncorrespondence course of at least 13 weeks duration and is carrying a subject load which is considered full-time for day students under the institution's standards and practices.

                <P>(ii) During periods of reasonable duration in which, in the judgment of the Office, the child is prevented by factors beyond the child's control from pursuing his or her education.</P>
                <P>(4) A student whose 23rd birthday occurs during a semester or the enrollment period in which such student is pursuing a full-time course of study or training shall continue to be considered a student until the end of such period, unless eligibility is otherwise terminated.</P>

The term “accident” means an event that was unpremeditated and unforeseen from the standpoint of the deceased individual. To determine whether the death of an individual did, in fact, result from an accident the adjudication officer will consider all the circumstances surrounding the casualty. An intentional and voluntary suicide will not be considered to be death by accident; however, suicide by an individual who is so incompetent as to be incapable of acting intentionally and voluntarily will be considered to be a death by accident. In no event will the death of an individual resulting from violent and external causes be considered a suicide unless there is direct proof that the fatal injury was self-inflicted.</P>
                <P>(3) The provisions of paragraph (g) shall not apply if the adjudication officer determines that at the time of the marriage involved, the miner would not reasonably have been expected to live for 9 months.</P>

A prior determination that such individual was, or was not, a dependent for the purposes of augmenting the miner's benefits for a certain period, is not determinative of the issue of whether the individual is a dependent survivor of such miner.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Member of the same household—“living with,” “living in the same household,” and “living in the miner's household,” defined.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Defined.</E> (1) The term “member of the same household” as used in section 402(a)(2) of the Act (with respect to a spouse); the term “living with” as used in section 402(e) of the Act (with respect to a surviving spouse); and the term “living in the same household” as used in this subpart, means that a husband and wife were customarily living together as husband and wife in the same place.</P>
                <P>(2) The term “living in the miner's household” as used in section 412(a)(5) of the Act (with respect to a parent, brother, or sister) means that the miner and such parent, brother, or sister were sharing the same residence.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary absence.</E> The temporary absence from the same residence of either the miner, or the miner's spouse, parent, brother, or sister (as the case may be), does not preclude a finding that one was “living with” the other, or that they were “members of the same household.” The absence of one such individual from the residence in which both had customarily lived shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be considered temporary:</P>
                <P>(1) If such absence was due to service in the Armed Forces of the United States; or</P>
                <P>(2) If the period of absence from his or her residence did not exceed 6 months and the absence was due to business or employment reasons, or because of confinement in a penal institution or in a hospital, nursing home, or other curative institution; or</P>
                <P>(3) In any other case, if the evidence establishes that despite such absence they nevertheless reasonably expected to resume physically living together.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relevant period of time.</E> (1) The determination as to whether a surviving spouse had been “living with” the miner shall be based upon the facts and circumstances as of the time of the death of the miner.</P>
                <P>(2) The determination as to whether a spouse is a “member of the same household” as the miner shall be based upon the facts and circumstances with respect to the period or periods of time as to which the issue of membership in the same household is material.</P>
                <P>(3) The determination as to whether a parent, brother, or sister was “living in the miner's household” shall take account of the 1-year period immediately prior to the miner's death.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Support and contributions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Support</E> defined. The term “support” includes food, shelter, clothing, ordinary medical expenses, and other ordinary and customary items for the maintenance of the person supported.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contributions</E> defined. The term “contributions” refers to contributions actually provided by the contributor from such individual's property, or the use thereof, or by the use of such individual's own credit.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Regular contributions</E> and <E T="03">substantial contributions</E> defined. The terms <PRTPAGE P="532"/>“regular contributions” and “substantial contributions” mean contributions that are customary and sufficient to constitute a material factor in the cost of the individual's support.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Contributions and community property.</E> When a spouse receives and uses for his or her support income from services or property, and such income, under applicable State law, is the community property of the wife and her husband, no part of such income is a “contribution” by one spouse to the other's support regardless of the legal interest of the donor. However, when a spouse receives and uses for support, income from the services and the property of the other spouse and, under applicable State law, such income is community property, all of such income is considered to be a contribution by the donor to the spouse's support.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Court order for support</E> defined. References to a support order in this subpart means any court order, judgment, or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction which requires regular contributions that are a material factor in the cost of the individual's support and which is in effect at the applicable time. If such contributions are required by a court order, this condition is met whether or not the contributions were actually made.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Written agreement</E> defined. The term “written agreement” in the phrase “substantial contributions pursuant to a written agreement”, as used in this subpart means an agreement signed by the miner providing for substantial contributions by the miner for the individual's support. It must be in effect at the applicable time but it need not be legally enforceable.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">One-half support</E> defined. The term “one-half support” means that the miner made regular contributions, in cash or in kind, to the support of a divorced spouse at the specified time or for the specified period, and that the amount of such contributions equalled or exceeded one-half the total cost of such individual's support at such time or during such period.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Totally dependent for support</E> defined. The term “totally dependent for support” as used in § 725.225(b) means that the miner made regular contributions to the support of the miner's parents, brother, or sister, as the case may be, and that the amount of such contributions at least equalled the total cost of such individual's support.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Additional claims; effect of prior denial of benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a claimant files a claim under this part while another claim filed by the claimant under this part is still pending, the later claim must be merged with the earlier claim for all purposes. For purposes of this section, a claim must be considered pending if it has not yet been finally denied.</P>
              <P>(b) If a claimant files a claim under this part within one year after the effective date of a final order denying a claim previously filed by the claimant under this part (see § 725.502(a)(2)), the later claim must be considered a request for modification of the prior denial and will be processed and adjudicated under § 725.310.</P>
              <P>(c) If a claimant files a claim under this part more than one year after the effective date of a final order denying a claim previously filed by the claimant under this part (see § 725.502(a)(2)), the later claim must be considered a subsequent claim for benefits. A subsequent claim will be processed and adjudicated in accordance with the provisions of subparts E and F of this part. Except as provided in paragraph (1) below, a subsequent claim must be denied unless the claimant demonstrates that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement (see §§ 725.202(d) (miner), 725.212 (spouse), 725.218 (child), and 725.222 (parent, brother, or sister)) has changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final. The applicability of this paragraph may be waived by the operator or fund, as appropriate. The following additional rules apply to the adjudication of a subsequent claim:</P>
              <P>(1) The requirement to establish a change in an applicable condition of entitlement does not apply to a survivor's claim if the requirements of §§ 725.212(a)(3)(ii), 725.218(a)(2), or 725.222(a)(5)(ii) are met, and the survivor's prior claim was filed—</P>
              <P>(i) On or before January 1, 2005, or</P>
              <P>(ii) After January 1, 2005 and was finally denied prior to March 23, 2010.</P>

              <P>(2) Any evidence submitted in connection with any prior claim must be made a part of the record in the subsequent claim, provided that it was not excluded in the adjudication of the prior claim.<PRTPAGE P="535"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this section, the applicable conditions of entitlement are limited to those conditions upon which the prior denial was based. For example, if the claim was denied solely on the basis that the individual was not a miner, the subsequent claim must be denied unless the individual worked as a miner following the prior denial. Similarly, if the claim was denied because the miner did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria contained in part 718 of this subchapter, the subsequent claim must be denied unless the miner meets at least one of the criteria that he or she did not meet previously.</P>
              <P>(4) If the applicable condition(s) of entitlement relate to the miner's physical condition, the subsequent claim may be approved only if new evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent claim establishes at least one applicable condition of entitlement. A subsequent claim filed by a surviving spouse, child, parent, brother, or sister must be denied unless the applicable conditions of entitlement in such claim include at least one condition unrelated to the miner's physical condition at the time of his death.</P>
              <P>(5) If the claimant demonstrates a change in one of the applicable conditions of entitlement, no findings made in connection with the prior claim, except those based on a party's failure to contest an issue (see § 725.463), will be binding on any party in the adjudication of the subsequent claim. However, any stipulation made by any party in connection with the prior claim will be binding on that party in the adjudication of the subsequent claim.</P>
              <P>(6) In any case in which a subsequent claim is awarded, no benefits may be paid for any period prior to the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.</P>
              <P>(d) In any case involving more than one claim filed by the same claimant, under no circumstances are duplicate benefits payable for concurrent periods of eligibility. Any duplicate benefits paid will be subject to collection or offset under subpart H of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Modification of awards and denials.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon his or her own initiative, or upon the request of any party on grounds of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact, the district director may, at any time before one year from the date of the last payment of benefits, or at any time before one year after the denial of a claim, reconsider the terms of an award or denial of benefits.</P>
              <P>(b) Modification proceedings must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this part as appropriate, except that the claimant and the operator, or group of operators or the fund, as appropriate, are each entitled to submit no more than one additional chest X-ray interpretation, one additional pulmonary function test, one additional arterial blood gas study, and one additional medical report in support of its affirmative case along with such rebuttal evidence and additional statements as are authorized by paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) of § 725.414. Modification proceedings may not be initiated before an administrative law judge or the Benefits Review Board.</P>
              <P>(c) At the conclusion of modification proceedings before the district director, the district director may issue a proposed decision and order (§ 725.418) or, if appropriate, deny the claim by reason of abandonment (§ 725.409). In any case in which the district director has initiated modification proceedings on his own initiative to alter the terms of an award or denial of benefits issued by an administrative law judge, the district director must, at the conclusion of modification proceedings, forward the claim for a hearing (§ 725.421). In any case forwarded for a hearing, the administrative law judge assigned to hear such case must consider whether any additional evidence submitted by the parties demonstrates a change in condition and, regardless of whether the parties have submitted new evidence, whether the evidence of record demonstrates a mistake in a determination of fact.</P>

              <P>(d) An order issued following the conclusion of modification proceedings may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase or decrease benefit payments or <PRTPAGE P="536"/>award benefits. Such order must not affect any benefits previously paid, except that an order increasing the amount of benefits payable based on a finding of a mistake in a determination of fact may be made effective on the date from which benefits were determined payable by the terms of an earlier award. In the case of an award which is decreased, no payment made in excess of the decreased rate prior to the date upon which the party requested reconsideration under paragraph (a) of this section will be subject to collection or offset under subpart H of this part, provided the claimant is without fault as defined by § 725.543. In the case of an award which is decreased following the initiation of modification by the district director, no payment made in excess of the decreased rate prior to the date upon which the district director initiated modification proceedings under paragraph (a) will be subject to collection or offset under subpart H of this part, provided the claimant is without fault as defined by § 725.543. In the case of an award which has become final and is thereafter terminated, no payment made prior to the date upon which the party requested reconsideration under paragraph (a) will be subject to collection or offset under subpart H of this part. In the case of an award which has become final and is thereafter terminated following the initiation of modification by the district director, no payment made prior to the date upon which the district director initiated modification proceedings under paragraph (a) will be subject to collection or offset under subpart H of this part.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) In this paragraph, an order is “effective” as described in § 725.502(a) and “final” as described in §§ 725.419(d), 725.479(a) or 802.406.</P>

              <P>(i) Paid to the claimant all monetary benefits, including retroactive benefits and interest under § 725.502(b)(2), due under any effective order;</P>

              <P>(ii) Paid to the claimant all additional compensation (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.607) due under an effective order;</P>
              <P>(iii) Paid all medical benefits (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) due under any effective award, but only if the order awards payment of specific medical expenses;</P>

              <P>(iv) Paid all final orders awarding attorney's fees and expenses under § 725.367 and witness fees under § 725.459, but only if the underlying benefits order is final (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.367(b)); and</P>
              <P>(v) Reimbursed the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, with interest, for all benefits paid under the orders described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) or (iii) of this section and the costs for the medical examination under § 725.406.</P>
              <P>(3) The requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section are inapplicable to any benefits owed pursuant to an effective but non-final order if the payment of such benefits has been stayed by the Benefits Review Board or appropriate court under 33 U.S.C. 921.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided by paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the operator must submit all documentary evidence pertaining to its compliance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to the district director concurrently with its request for modification. The claimant is also entitled to submit any relevant evidence to the district director. Absent extraordinary circumstances, no documentary evidence pertaining to the operator's compliance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) at the time of the modification request will be admitted into the hearing record or otherwise considered at any later stage of the proceeding.</P>

              <P>(5) The requirements imposed by paragraph (e)(2) of this section are continuing in nature. If at any time during the modification proceedings the operator fails to meet the payment obligations described, the adjudication officer must issue an order to show cause why the operator's modification request should not be denied and afford all parties time to respond to such order. Responses may include evidence pertaining to the operator's continued compliance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2). If, after the time for response has expired, the adjudication officer determines that the operator is not meeting its obligations, the adjudication officer must deny the operator's modification request.<PRTPAGE P="537"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) The denial of a request for modification under this section will not bar any future modification request by the operator, so long as the operator satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with each future modification petition.</P>
              <P>(7) The provisions of this paragraph apply to all modification requests filed on or after May 26, 2016.</P>

Such appointment shall be made in writing or on the record at the hearing. An attorney qualified in accordance with § 725.363(a) shall file a written declaration that he or she is authorized to represent a party, or declare his or her representation on the record at a formal hearing. Any other person (see § 725.363(b)) shall file a written notice of appointment signed by the party or his or her legal guardian, or enter his or her appearance on the record at a formal hearing if the party he or she seeks to represent is present and consents to the representation. Any written declaration or notice required by this section shall include the OWCP number assigned by the Office and shall be sent to the Office or, for representation at a formal hearing, to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. In any case, such representative must be qualified under § 725.363. No authorization for representation or agreement between a claimant and representative as to the amount of a fee, filed with the Social Security Administration in connection with a claim under part B of title IV of the Act, shall be valid under this part. A claimant who has previously authorized a person to represent him or her in connection with a claim originally filed under part B of title IV may renew such authorization by filing a statement to such effect with the Office or appropriate adjudication officer.</P>
              <P>(b) Any party may waive his or her right to be represented in the adjudication of a claim. If an adjudication officer determines, after an appropriate inquiry has been made, that a claimant who has been informed of his or her right to representation does not wish to obtain the services of a representative, such adjudication officer shall proceed to consider the claim in accordance with this part, unless it is apparent that the claimant is, for any reason, unable to continue without the help of a representative. However, it shall not be necessary for an adjudication officer to inquire as to the ability of a claimant to proceed without representation in any adjudication taking place without a hearing. The failure of a claimant to obtain representation in an adjudication taking place without a hearing shall be considered a waiver of the claimant's right to representation. However, at any time during the processing or adjudication of a claim, any claimant may revoke such waiver and obtain a representative.</P>

              <P>(a) A representative seeking a fee for services performed on behalf of a claimant shall make application therefor to the district director, administrative law judge, or appropriate appellate tribunal, as the case may be, before whom the services were performed. The application shall be filed and served upon the claimant and all other parties within the time limits allowed by the district director, administrative law judge, or appropriate appellate tribunal. The application shall be supported by a complete statement of the extent and character of the necessary work done, and shall indicate the professional status (e.g., attorney, paralegal, law clerk, lay representative or clerical) of the person performing such work, and the customary billing rate for each such person. The application shall also include a listing of reasonable unreimbursed expenses, including those for travel, incurred by the representative or an employee of a representative in establishing the claimant's case. Any fee requested under this paragraph shall also contain a description of any fee requested, charged, or received for services rendered to the claimant before any State or Federal court or agency in connection with a related matter.</P>

              <P>(b) Any fee approved under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reasonably commensurate with the necessary work done and shall take into account the quality of the representation, the qualifications of the representative, the complexity of the legal issues involved, the level of proceedings to which the claim was raised, the level at which the representative entered the proceedings, and any other information which may be relevant to the amount of fee requested. No fee approved shall include payment for time spent in preparation of a fee application. No fee <PRTPAGE P="541"/>shall be approved for work done on claims filed between December 30, 1969, and June 30, 1973, under part B of title IV of the Act, except for services rendered on behalf of the claimant in regard to the review of the claim under section 435 of the Act and part 727 of this subchapter (see § 725.4(d)).</P>
              <P>(c) In awarding a fee, the appropriate adjudication officer shall consider, and shall add to the fee, the amount of reasonable and unreimbursed expenses incurred in establishing the claimant's case. Reimbursement for travel expenses incurred by an attorney shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of § 725.459(a). No reimbursement shall be permitted for expenses incurred in obtaining medical or other evidence which has previously been submitted to the Office in connection with the claim.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of a request for approval of a fee, such request shall be reviewed and evaluated by the appropriate adjudication officer and a fee award issued. Any party may request reconsideration of a fee awarded by the adjudication officer. A revised or modified fee award may then be issued, if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(e) Each request for reconsideration or review of a fee award shall be in writing and shall contain supporting statements or information pertinent to any increase or decrease requested. If a fee awarded by a district director is disputed, such award shall be appealable directly to the Benefits Review Board. In such a fee dispute case, the record before the Board shall consist of the order of the district director awarding or denying the fee, the application for a fee, any written statement in opposition to the fee and the documentary evidence contained in the file which verifies or refutes any item claimed in the fee application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payment of a claimant's attorney's fee by responsible operator or fund.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An attorney who represents a claimant in the successful prosecution of a claim for benefits may be entitled to collect a reasonable attorney's fee from the responsible operator that is ultimately found liable for the payment of benefits, or, in a case in which there is no operator who is liable for the payment of benefits, from the fund. Generally, the operator or fund liable for the payment of benefits shall be liable for the payment of the claimant's attorney's fees where the operator or fund, as appropriate, took action, or acquiesced in action, that created an adversarial relationship between itself and the claimant. The fees payable under this section shall include reasonable fees for necessary services performed prior to the creation of the adversarial relationship. Circumstances in which a successful attorney's fees shall be payable by the responsible operator or the fund include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The responsible operator designated by the district director (see § 725.410(a)(3)) fails to accept the claimant's entitlement to benefits within the 30-day period provided by § 725.412(b) and is ultimately determined to be liable for benefits. The operator shall be liable for an attorney's fee with respect to all necessary services performed by the claimant's attorney;</P>
              <P>(2) There is no operator that may be held liable for the payment of benefits, and the district director issues a schedule for the submission of additional evidence under § 725.410. The fund shall be liable for an attorney's fee with respect to all necessary services performed by the claimant's attorney;</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant submits a bill for medical treatment, and the party liable for the payment of benefits declines to pay the bill on the grounds that the treatment is unreasonable, or is for a condition that is not compensable. The responsible operator or fund, as appropriate, shall be liable for an attorney's fee with respect to all necessary services performed by the claimant's attorney;</P>

              <P>(4) A beneficiary seeks an increase in the amount of benefits payable, and the responsible operator or fund contests the claimant's right to that increase. If the beneficiary is successful in securing an increase in the amount of benefits payable, the operator or fund shall be liable for an attorney's fee with respect to all necessary services performed by the beneficiary's attorney;<PRTPAGE P="542"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) The responsible operator or fund seeks a decrease in the amount of benefits payable. If the beneficiary is successful in resisting the request for a decrease in the amount of benefits payable, the operator or fund shall be liable for an attorney's fee with respect to all necessary services performed by the beneficiary's attorney. A request for information clarifying the amount of benefits payable shall not be considered a request to decrease that amount.</P>
              <P>(b) Any fee awarded under this section shall be in addition to the award of benefits, and shall be awarded, in an order, by the district director, administrative law judge, Board or court, before whom the work was performed. The operator or fund shall pay such fee promptly and directly to the claimant's attorney in a lump sum after the award of benefits becomes final.</P>
              <P>(c) Section 205(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, Public Law 97-119, amended section 422 of the Act and relieved operators and carriers from liability for the payment of benefits on certain claims. Payment of benefits on those claims was made the responsibility of the fund. The claims subject to this transfer of liability are described in § 725.496. On claims subject to the transfer of liability described in this paragraph the fund will pay all fees and costs which have been or will be awarded to claimant's attorneys which were or would have become the liability of an operator or carrier but for the enactment of the 1981 Amendments and which have not already been paid by such operator or carrier. Section 9501(d)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.), which was also enacted as a part of the 1981 Amendments to the Act, expressly prohibits the fund from reimbursing an operator or carrier for any attorney fees or costs which it has paid on cases subject to the transfer of liability provisions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Medical examinations and tests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Act requires the Department to provide each miner who applies for benefits with the opportunity to undergo a complete pulmonary evaluation at no expense to the miner. A complete pulmonary evaluation includes a report of physical examination, a pulmonary function study, a chest radiograph, and, unless medically contraindicated, a blood gas study.</P>
              <P>(b) As soon as possible after a miner files an application for benefits, the district director will provide the miner with a list of medical facilities and physicians in the state of the miner's residence and states contiguous to the state of the miner's residence that the Office has authorized to perform complete pulmonary evaluations. The miner must select one of the facilities or physicians on the list, provided that the miner may not select any physician to whom the miner or the miner's spouse is related to the fourth degree of consanguinity, and the miner may not select any physician who has examined or provided medical treatment to the miner within the twelve months preceding the date of the miner's application. The district director will make arrangements for the miner to be given a complete pulmonary evaluation by that facility or physician. The results of the complete pulmonary evaluation must not be counted as evidence submitted by the miner under § 725.414.</P>
              <P>(c) If any medical examination or test conducted under paragraph (a) of this section is not administered or reported in substantial compliance with the provisions of part 718 of this subchapter, or does not provide sufficient information to allow the district director to decide whether the miner is eligible for benefits, the district director must schedule the miner for further examination and testing. Where the deficiencies in the report are the result of a lack of effort on the part of the miner, the miner will be afforded one additional opportunity to produce a satisfactory result. In order to determine whether any medical examination or test was administered and reported in substantial compliance with the provisions of part 718 of this subchapter, the district director may have any component of such examination or test reviewed by a physician selected by the district director.</P>
              <P>(d) After the physician completes the report authorized by paragraph (a), the district director will inform the miner that he may elect to have the results of the objective testing sent to his treating physician for use in preparing a medical opinion. The district director will also inform the claimant that any medical opinion submitted by his treating physician will count as one of the two medical opinions that the miner may submit under § 725.414 of this part.</P>

              <P>(e) The cost of any medical examination or test authorized under this section, including the cost of travel to and from the examination, must be paid by <PRTPAGE P="544"/>the fund. Reimbursement for overnight accommodations must not be authorized unless the district director determines that an adequate testing facility is unavailable within one day's round trip travel by automobile from the miner's residence. The fund must be reimbursed for such payments by an operator, if any, found liable for the payment of benefits to the claimant. If an operator fails to repay such expenses, with interest, upon request of the Office, the entire amount may be collected in an action brought under section 424 of the Act and § 725.603.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Identification and notification of responsible operator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon receipt of the miner's employment history, the district director shall investigate whether any operator may be held liable for the payment of benefits as a responsible operator in accordance with the criteria contained in Subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The district director may identify one or more operators potentially liable for the payment of benefits in accordance with the criteria set forth in § 725.495 of this part. The district director shall notify each such operator of the existence of the claim. Where the records maintained by the Office pursuant to part 726 of this subchapter indicate that the operator had obtained a policy of insurance, and the claim falls within such policy, the notice provided pursuant to this section shall also be sent to the operator's carrier. Any operator or carrier notified of the claim shall thereafter be considered a party to the claim in accordance with § 725.360 of this part unless it is dismissed by an adjudication officer and is not thereafter notified again of its potential liability.</P>
              <P>(c) The notification issued pursuant to this section shall include a copy of the claimant's application and a copy of all evidence obtained by the district director relating to the miner's employment. The district director may request the operator to answer specific questions, including, but not limited to, questions related to the nature of its operations, its relationship with the miner, its financial status, including any insurance obtained to secure its obligations under the Act, and its relationship with other potentially liable operators. A copy of any notification issued pursuant to this section shall be sent to the claimant by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(d) If at any time before a case is referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges, the district director determines that an operator which may be liable for the payment of benefits has not been notified under this section or has been incorrectly dismissed pursuant to § 725.410(a)(3), the district director shall give such operator notice of its potential liability in accordance with this section. The adjudication officer shall then take such further action on the claim as may be appropriate. There shall be no time limit applicable to a later identification of an operator under this paragraph if the operator fraudulently concealed its identity as an employer of the miner. The district director may not notify additional operators of their potential liability after a case has been referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges, unless the case was referred for a hearing to determine whether the claim was properly denied as abandoned pursuant to § 725.409.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) An operator which receives notification under § 725.407 shall, within 30 days of receipt, file a response indicating its intent to accept or contest its identification as a potentially liable operator. The operator's response shall also be sent to the claimant by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(2) If the operator contests its identification, it shall, on a form supplied by the district director, state the precise nature of its disagreement by admitting or denying each of the following assertions. In answering these assertions, the term “operator” shall include any operator for which the identified operator may be considered a successor operator pursuant to § 725.492.</P>

              <P>(i) That the named operator was an operator for any period after June 30, 1973;<PRTPAGE P="545"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) That the operator employed the miner as a miner for a cumulative period of not less than one year;</P>
              <P>(iii) That the miner was exposed to coal mine dust while working for the operator;</P>
              <P>(iv) That the miner's employment with the operator included at least one working day after December 31, 1969; and</P>
              <P>(v) That the operator is capable of assuming liability for the payment of benefits.</P>
              <P>(3) An operator which receives notification under § 725.407, and which fails to file a response within the time limit provided by this section, shall not be allowed to contest its liability for the payment of benefits on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (a)(2).</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Within 90 days of the date on which it receives notification under § 725.407, an operator may submit documentary evidence in support of its position.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Denial of a claim by reason of abandonment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A claim may be denied at any time by the district director by reason of abandonment where the claimant fails:</P>
              <P>(1) To undergo a required medical examination without good cause; or,</P>
              <P>(2) To submit evidence sufficient to make a determination of the claim; or,</P>
              <P>(3) To pursue the claim with reasonable diligence; or,</P>
              <P>(4) To attend an informal conference without good cause.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If the district director determines that a denial by reason of abandonment under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section is appropriate, he or she shall notify the claimant of the reasons for such denial and of the action which must be taken to avoid a denial by reason of abandonment. If the claimant completes the action requested within the time allowed, the claim shall be developed, processed and adjudicated as specified in this part. If the claimant does not fully comply with the action requested by the district director, the district director shall notify the claimant that the claim has been denied by reason of abandonment. Such notification shall be served on the claimant and all other parties to the claim by certified mail.</P>
              <P>(2) In any case in which a claimant has failed to attend an informal conference and has not provided the district director with his reasons for failing to attend, the district director shall ask the claimant to explain his absence. In considering whether the claimant had good cause for his failure to attend the conference, the district director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including the age, education, and health of the claimant, as well as the distance between the claimant's residence and the location of the conference. If the district director concludes that the claimant had good cause for failing to attend the conference, he may continue processing the claim, including, where appropriate under § 725.416, the scheduling of an informal conference. If the claimant does not supply the district director with his reasons for failing to attend the conference within 30 days of the date of the district director's request, or the district director concludes that the reasons supplied by the claimant do not establish good cause, the district director shall notify the claimant that the claim has been denied by reason of abandonment. Such notification shall be served on the claimant and all other parties to the claim by certified mail.</P>

              <P>(c) The denial of a claim by reason of abandonment shall become effective and final unless, within 30 days after the denial is issued, the claimant requests a hearing. Following the expiration of the 30-day period, a new claim may be filed at any time pursuant to § 725.309. For purposes of § 725.309, a denial by reason of abandonment shall be deemed a finding that the claimant has not established any applicable condition of entitlement. If the claimant timely requests a hearing, the district director shall refer the case to the Office of Administrative Law Judges in accordance with § 725.421. Except upon the motion or written agreement of the Director, the hearing will be limited to the issue of whether the claim was <PRTPAGE P="546"/>properly denied by reason of abandonment. If the hearing is limited to the issue of abandonment and the administrative law judge determines that the claim was not properly denied by reason of abandonment, he shall remand the claim to the district director for the completion of administrative processing.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Submission of additional evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After the district director completes the development of medical evidence under § 725.405 of this part, including the complete pulmonary evaluation authorized by § 725.406, and receives the responses and evidence submitted pursuant to § 725.408, he shall issue a schedule for the submission of additional evidence. The schedule shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) If the claim was filed by, or on behalf of, a miner, the schedule shall contain a summary of the complete pulmonary evaluation administered pursuant to § 725.406. If the claim was filed by, or on behalf of, a survivor, the schedule shall contain a summary of any medical evidence developed by the district director pursuant to § 725.405(c).</P>
              <P>(2) The schedule shall contain the district director's preliminary analysis of the medical evidence. If the district director believes that the evidence fails to establish any necessary element of entitlement, he shall inform the claimant of the element of entitlement not established and the reasons for his conclusions and advise the claimant that, unless he submits additional evidence, the district director will issue a proposed decision and order denying the claim.</P>
              <P>(3) The schedule shall contain the district director's designation of a responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits. In the event that the district director has designated as the responsible operator an employer other than the employer who last employed the claimant as a miner, the district director shall include, with the schedule, a copy of the statements required by § 725.495(d) of this part. The district director may, in his discretion, dismiss as parties any of the operators notified of their potential liability pursuant to § 725.407. If the district director thereafter determines that the participation of a party dismissed pursuant to this section is required, he may once again notify the operator in accordance with § 725.407(d).</P>
              <P>(4) The schedule shall notify the claimant and the designated responsible operator that they have the right to obtain further adjudication of the claim in accordance with this subpart, and that they have the right to submit additional evidence in accordance with this subpart. The schedule shall also notify the claimant that he has the right to obtain representation, under the terms set forth in subpart D, in order to assist him. In a case in which the district director has designated a responsible operator pursuant to paragraph (a)(3), the schedule shall further notify the claimant that if the operator fails to accept the claimant's entitlement to benefits within the time limit provided by § 725.412, the cost of obtaining additional medical and other necessary evidence, along with a reasonable attorney's fee, shall be reimbursed by the responsible operator in the event that the claimant establishes his entitlement to benefits payable by that operator. In a case in which there is no operator liable for the payment of benefits, the schedule shall notify the claimant that the cost of obtaining additional medical and other necessary evidence, along with a reasonable attorney's fee, shall be reimbursed by the fund.</P>
              <P>(b) The schedule shall allow all parties not less than 60 days within which to submit additional evidence, including evidence relevant to the claimant's eligibility for benefits and evidence relevant to the liability of the designated responsible operator, and shall provide not less than an additional 30 days within which the parties may respond to evidence submitted by other parties. Any such evidence must meet the requirements set forth in § 725.414 in order to be admitted into the record.</P>

              <P>(c) The district director shall serve a copy of the schedule, together with a copy of all of the evidence developed, on the claimant, the designated responsible operator, and all other operators which received notification pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="547"/>§ 725.407. The schedule shall be served on each party by certified mail.</P>

Supplemental medical reports prepared by the same physician must be considered part of the physician's original medical report. A physician's written assessment of a single objective test, such as a chest X-ray or a pulmonary function test, is not a medical report for purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The claimant is entitled to submit, in support of his affirmative case, no more than two chest X-ray interpretations, the results of no more than two pulmonary function tests, the results of no more than two arterial blood gas studies, no more than one report of an autopsy, no more than one report of each biopsy, and no more than two medical reports. Any chest X-ray interpretations, pulmonary function test results, blood gas studies, autopsy report, biopsy report, and physicians' opinions that appear in a medical report must each be admissible under this paragraph or paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) The claimant is entitled to submit, in rebuttal of the case presented by the party opposing entitlement, no more than one physician's interpretation of each chest X-ray, pulmonary function test, arterial blood gas study, autopsy or biopsy submitted by the designated responsible operator or the <PRTPAGE P="549"/>fund, as appropriate, under paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(iii) of this section and by the Director pursuant to § 725.406. In any case in which the party opposing entitlement has submitted the results of other testing pursuant to § 718.107, the claimant is entitled to submit one physician's assessment of each piece of such evidence in rebuttal. In addition, where the responsible operator or fund has submitted rebuttal evidence under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) or (a)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to medical testing submitted by the claimant, the claimant is entitled to submit an additional statement from the physician who originally interpreted the chest X-ray or administered the objective testing. Where the rebuttal evidence tends to undermine the conclusion of a physician who prepared a medical report submitted by the claimant, the claimant is entitled to submit an additional statement from the physician who prepared the medical report explaining his conclusion in light of the rebuttal evidence.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The responsible operator designated pursuant to § 725.410 is entitled to obtain and submit, in support of its affirmative case, no more than two chest X-ray interpretations, the results of no more than two pulmonary function tests, the results of no more than two arterial blood gas studies, no more than one report of an autopsy, no more than one report of each biopsy, and no more than two medical reports. Any chest X-ray interpretations, pulmonary function test results, blood gas studies, autopsy report, biopsy report, and physicians' opinions that appear in a medical report must each be admissible under this paragraph or paragraph (a)(4) of this section. In obtaining such evidence, the responsible operator may not require the miner to travel more than 100 miles from his or her place of residence, or the distance traveled by the miner in obtaining the complete pulmonary evaluation provided by § 725.406 of this part, whichever is greater, unless a trip of greater distance is authorized in writing by the district director. If a miner unreasonably refuses—</P>
              <P>(A) To provide the Office or the designated responsible operator with a complete statement of his or her medical history and/or to authorize access to his or her medical records, or</P>

              <P>(B) To submit to an evaluation or test requested by the district director or the designated responsible operator, the miner's claim may be denied by reason of abandonment. (<E T="03">See</E> § 725.409 of this part).</P>
              <P>(ii) The responsible operator is entitled to submit, in rebuttal of the case presented by the claimant, no more than one physician's interpretation of each chest X-ray, pulmonary function test, arterial blood gas study, autopsy or biopsy submitted by the claimant under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and by the Director pursuant to § 725.406. In any case in which the claimant has submitted the results of other testing pursuant to § 718.107, the responsible operator is entitled to submit one physician's assessment of each piece of such evidence in rebuttal. In addition, where the claimant has submitted rebuttal evidence under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the responsible operator is entitled to submit an additional statement from the physician who originally interpreted the chest X-ray or administered the objective testing. Where the rebuttal evidence tends to undermine the conclusion of a physician who prepared a medical report submitted by the responsible operator, the responsible operator is entitled to submit an additional statement from the physician who prepared the medical report explaining his conclusion in light of the rebuttal evidence.</P>

              <P>(iii) In a case in which the district director has not identified any potentially liable operators, or has dismissed all potentially liable operators under § 725.410(a)(3), or has identified a liable operator that ceases to defend the claim on grounds of an inability to provide for payment of continuing benefits, the district director is entitled to exercise the rights of a responsible operator under this section, except that the evidence obtained in connection with the complete pulmonary evaluation performed pursuant to § 725.406 must be considered evidence obtained and submitted by the Director, OWCP, for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. In a case involving a dispute concerning medical benefits under <PRTPAGE P="550"/>§ 725.708 of this part, the district director is entitled to develop medical evidence to determine whether the medical bill is compensable under the standard set forth in § 725.701 of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, any record of a miner's hospitalization for a respiratory or pulmonary or related disease, or medical treatment for a respiratory or pulmonary or related disease, may be received into evidence.</P>
              <P>(5) A copy of any documentary evidence submitted by a party must be served on all other parties to the claim. If the claimant is not represented by an attorney, the district director must mail a copy of all documentary evidence submitted by the claimant to all other parties to the claim. Following the development and submission of affirmative medical evidence, the parties may submit rebuttal evidence in accordance with the schedule issued by the district director.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Evidence pertaining to liability.</E> (1) Except as provided by § 725.408(b)(2), the designated responsible operator may submit evidence to demonstrate that it is not the potentially liable operator that most recently employed the claimant.</P>
              <P>(2) Any other party may submit evidence regarding the liability of the designated responsible operator or any other operator.</P>
              <P>(3) A copy of any documentary evidence submitted under this paragraph must be mailed to all other parties to the claim. Following the submission of affirmative evidence, the parties may submit rebuttal evidence in accordance with the schedule issued by the district director.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Testimony.</E> A physician who prepared a medical report admitted under this section may testify with respect to the claim at any formal hearing conducted in accordance with subpart F of this part, or by deposition. If a party has submitted fewer than two medical reports as part of that party's affirmative case under this section, a physician who did not prepare a medical report may testify in lieu of such a medical report. The testimony of such a physician will be considered a medical report for purposes of the limitations provided by this section. A party may offer the testimony of no more than two physicians under the provisions of this section unless the adjudication officer finds good cause under paragraph (b)(1) of § 725.456 of this part. In accordance with the schedule issued by the district director, all parties must notify the district director of the name and current address of any potential witness whose testimony pertains to the liability of a potentially liable operator or the designated responsible operator. Absent such notice, the testimony of a witness relevant to the liability of a potentially liable operator or the designated responsible operator will not be admitted in any hearing conducted with respect to the claim unless the administrative law judge finds that the lack of notice should be excused due to extraordinary circumstances.</P>
              <P>(d) Except to the extent permitted by §§ 725.456 and 725.310(b), the limitations set forth in this section apply to all proceedings conducted with respect to a claim, and no documentary evidence pertaining to liability may be admitted in any further proceeding conducted with respect to a claim unless it is submitted to the district director in accordance with this section.</P>

              <P>(a) At the end of the period permitted under § 725.410(b) for the submission of evidence, the district director shall review the claim on the basis of all evidence submitted in accordance with § 725.414.</P>

              <P>(b) After review of all evidence submitted, the district director may issue another schedule for the submission of additional evidence pursuant to § 725.410, identifying another potentially liable operator as the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits. In such a case, the district director shall not permit the development or submission of any additional medical evidence until after he has made a final determination of the identity of the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits. If the operator <PRTPAGE P="551"/>who is finally determined to be the responsible operator has not had the opportunity to submit medical evidence pursuant to § 725.410, the district director shall allow the designated responsible operator and the claimant not less than 60 days within which to submit evidence relevant to the claimant's eligibility for benefits. The designated responsible operator may elect to adopt any medical evidence previously submitted by another operator as its own evidence, subject to the limitations of § 725.414. The district director may also schedule a conference in accordance with § 725.416, issue a proposed decision and order in accordance with § 725.418, or take such other action as the district director considers appropriate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conferences.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At the conclusion of the period permitted by § 725.410(b) of this part for the submission of evidence, the district director may conduct an informal conference in any claim where it appears that such conference will assist in the voluntary resolution of any issue raised with respect to the claim. The conference proceedings shall not be stenographically reported and sworn testimony shall not be taken. Any conference conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall be held no later than 90 days after the conclusion of the period permitted by § 725.410(b) of this part for the submission of evidence, unless one of the parties requests that the time period be extended for good cause shown. If the district director is unable to hold the conference within the time period permitted by this paragraph, he shall proceed to issue a proposed decision and order under § 725.418 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The district director shall notify the parties of a definite time and place for the conference. The district director shall advise the parties that they have a right to representation at the conference, by an attorney or a lay representative, and that no conference shall take place unless the parties are represented. A coal mine operator which is self-insured, or which is covered by a policy of insurance for the claim for which a conference is scheduled, shall be deemed to be represented. The notification shall set forth the specific reasons why the district director believes that a conference will assist in the voluntary resolution of any issue raised with respect to the claim. No sanction may be imposed under paragraph (c) of this section unless the record contains a notification that meets the requirements of this section. The district director may in his or her discretion, or on the motion of any party, cancel a conference or allow any or all of the parties to participate by telephone.</P>
              <P>(c) The unexcused failure of any party to appear at an informal conference shall be grounds for the imposition of sanctions. If the claimant fails to appear, the district director may take such steps as are authorized by § 725.409(b)(2) to deny the claim by reason of abandonment. If the responsible operator fails to appear, it shall be deemed to have waived its right to contest its potential liability for an award of benefits and, in the discretion of the district director, its right to contest any issue related to the claimant's eligibility.</P>
              <P>(d) Any representative of an operator, of an operator's insurance carrier, or of a claimant, authorized to represent such party in accordance with paragraph (b), shall be deemed to have sufficient authority to stipulate facts or issues or agree to a final disposition of the claim.</P>
              <P>(e) Procedures to be followed at a conference shall be within the discretion of the district director.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Action at the conclusion of conference.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At the conclusion of a conference, the district director shall prepare a stipulation of contested and uncontested issues which shall be signed by the parties and the district director. If a hearing is conducted with respect to the claim, this stipulation shall be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law Judges and placed in the claim record.</P>

              <P>(b) In appropriate cases, the district director may permit a reasonable time for the submission of additional evidence following a conference, provided that such evidence does not exceed the limits set forth in § 725.414. The district <PRTPAGE P="552"/>director may also notify additional operators of their potential liability pursuant to § 725.407, or issue another schedule for the submission of additional evidence pursuant to § 725.410, designating another potentially liable operator as the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits, in order to allow that operator an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to its liability for benefits as well as the claimant's eligibility for benefits.</P>
              <P>(c) Within 20 days after the termination of all conference proceedings, the district director shall prepare and send to the parties a proposed decision and order pursuant to § 725.418 of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Proposed decision and order.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Within 20 days after the termination of all informal conference proceedings, or, if no informal conference is held, at the conclusion of the period permitted by § 725.410(b) for the submission of evidence, the district director will issue a proposed decision and order. A proposed decision and order is a document, issued by the district director after the evidentiary development of the claim is completed and all contested issues, if any, are joined, which purports to resolve a claim on the basis of the evidence submitted to or obtained by the district director. A proposed decision and order will be considered a final adjudication of a claim only as provided in § 725.419. A proposed decision and order may be issued by the district director at any time during the adjudication of any claim if:</P>
              <P>(1) Issuance is authorized or required by this part;</P>
              <P>(2) The district director determines that its issuance will expedite the adjudication of the claim; or</P>

              <P>(3) The district director determines that the claimant is a survivor who is entitled to benefits under 30 U.S.C. 932(l). In such cases, the district director may designate the responsible operator in the proposed decision and order regardless of whether the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section have been met. Any operator identified as liable for benefits under this paragraph may challenge the finding of liability by timely requesting revision of the proposed decision and order and specifically indicating disagreement with that finding. <E T="03">See</E> 20 CFR 725.419(a) and (b). In such cases, the district director must allow all parties 30 days within which to submit liability evidence. At the end of this period, the district director must issue a new proposed decision and order.</P>
              <P>(b) A proposed decision and order must contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. It must be served on all parties to the claim by certified mail.</P>
              <P>(c) The proposed decision and order must contain a notice of the right of any interested party to request a formal hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Judges. If the proposed decision and order is a denial of benefits, and the claimant has previously filed a request for a hearing, the proposed decision and order must notify the claimant that the case will be referred for a hearing pursuant to the previous request unless the claimant notifies the district director that he no longer desires a hearing. If the proposed decision and order is an award of benefits, and the designated responsible operator has previously filed a request for a hearing, the proposed decision and order must notify the operator that the case will be referred for a hearing pursuant to the previous request unless the operator notifies the district director that it no longer desires a hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) The proposed decision and order must reflect the district director's final designation of the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no operator may be finally designated as the responsible operator unless it has received notification of its potential liability pursuant to § 725.407, and the opportunity to submit additional evidence pursuant to § 725.410. The district director must dismiss, as parties to the claim, all other potentially liable operators that received notification pursuant to § 725.407 and that were not previously dismissed pursuant to § 725.410(a)(3).</P>

              <P>(c) If a timely request for revision of a proposed decision and order is made, the district director may amend the proposed decision and order, as circumstances require, and serve the revised proposed decision and order on all parties or take such other action as is appropriate. If a revised proposed decision and order is issued, each party to the claim shall have 30 days from the date of issuance of that revised proposed decision and order within which to request a hearing.</P>

Once a proposed decision and order or revised proposed decision and order becomes final and effective, all rights to further proceedings with respect to the claim shall be considered waived, except as provided in § 725.310.</P>

              <P>(a) Section 9501(d)(1)(A)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) provides that the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund shall begin the payment of benefits on behalf of an operator in any case in which the operator liable for such payments has not commenced payment of such benefits within 30 days after the date of an initial determination of eligibility by the Secretary. For claims filed on or after January 1, 1982, the payment of such interim benefits from the fund is limited to benefits accruing after the date of such initial determination.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in § 725.415, after the district director has determined that a claimant is eligible for benefits, on the basis of all evidence submitted by a claimant and operator, and has determined that a hearing will be necessary to resolve the claim, the district director shall in writing so inform the parties and direct the operator to begin the payment of benefits to the claimant in accordance with § 725.522. The date on which this writing is sent to the parties shall be considered the date of initial determination of the claim.</P>
              <P>(c) If a notified operator refuses to commence payment of a claim within 30 days from the date on which an initial determination is made under this section, benefits shall be paid by the fund to the claimant in accordance with § 725.522, and the operator shall be liable to the fund, if such operator is determined liable for the claim, for all benefits paid by the fund on behalf of such operator, and, in addition, such penalties and interest as are appropriate.</P>

              <P>(b) In any case referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges under this section, the district director shall transmit to that office the following documents, which shall be placed in the record at the hearing subject to the objection of any party:</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Documentary evidence pertaining to the liability of a potentially liable operator and/or the identification of a responsible operator which was not submitted to the district director shall not be admitted into the hearing record in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. Medical evidence in excess of the limitations contained in § 725.414 shall not be admitted into the hearing record in the absence of good cause.</P>
              <P>(2) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any other documentary material, including medical reports, which was not submitted to the district director, may be received in evidence subject to the objection of any party, if such evidence is sent to all other parties at least 20 days before a hearing is held in connection with the claim.</P>
              <P>(3) Documentary evidence, which is not exchanged with the parties in accordance with this paragraph, may be admitted at the hearing with the written consent of the parties or on the record at the hearing, or upon a showing of good cause why such evidence was not exchanged in accordance with this paragraph. If documentary evidence is not exchanged in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the parties do not waive the 20-day requirement or good cause is not shown, the administrative law judge shall either exclude the late evidence from the record or remand the claim to the district director for consideration of such evidence.</P>
              <P>(4) A medical report which is not made available to the parties in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not be admitted into evidence in any case unless the hearing record is kept open for at least 30 days after the hearing to permit the parties to take such action as each considers appropriate in response to such evidence. If, in the opinion of the administrative law judge, evidence is withheld from the parties for the purpose of delaying the adjudication of the claim, the administrative law judge may exclude such evidence from the hearing record and close the record at the conclusion of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, documentary evidence which the district director excludes from the record, and the objections to such evidence, may be submitted by the parties to the administrative law judge, who shall independently determine whether the evidence shall be admitted.</P>
              <P>(1) If the evidence is admitted, the administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, remand the claim to the district director for further consideration.</P>
              <P>(2) If the evidence is admitted, the administrative law judge shall afford the opposing party or parties the opportunity to develop such additional documentary evidence as is necessary to protect the right of cross-examination.</P>
              <P>(d) All medical records and reports submitted by any party shall be considered by the administrative law judge in accordance with the quality standards contained in part 718 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(e) If the administrative law judge concludes that the complete pulmonary evaluation provided pursuant to § 725.406, or any part thereof, fails to comply with the applicable quality standards, or fails to address the relevant conditions of entitlement (see § 725.202(d)(2)(i) through (iv)) in a manner which permits resolution of the claim, the administrative law judge shall, in his or her discretion, remand the claim to the district director with instructions to develop only such additional evidence as is required, or allow the parties a reasonable time to obtain and submit such evidence, before the termination of the hearing.</P>

              <P>(a) Witnesses at the hearing shall testify under oath or affirmation. The administrative law judge and the parties may question witnesses with respect to any matters relevant and material to any contested issue. Any party who intends to present the testimony of an expert witness at a hearing, including any physician, regardless of whether the physician has previously prepared a medical report, shall so notify all other parties to the claim at least 10 days before the hearing. The failure to give notice of the appearance of an expert witness in accordance with this paragraph, unless notice is waived by all parties, shall preclude the presentation of testimony by such expert witness.</P>
              <P>(b) No person shall be required to appear as a witness in any proceeding before an administrative law judge at a place more than 100 miles from his or her place of residence, unless the lawful mileage and witness fee for 1 day's attendance is paid in advance of the hearing date.</P>
              <P>(c) No person shall be permitted to testify as a witness at the hearing, or pursuant to deposition or interrogatory under § 725.458, unless that person meets the requirements of § 725.414(c).</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a witness offering testimony relevant to the liability of the responsible operator, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the witness must have been identified as a potential hearing witness while the claim was pending before the district director.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a physician offering testimony relevant to the physical condition of the miner, such physician must have prepared a medical report. Alternatively, in the absence of a showing of good cause under § 725.456(b)(1) of this part, a physician may offer testimony relevant to the physical condition of the miner only to the extent that the party offering the physician's testimony has submitted fewer medical reports than permitted by § 725.414. Such physician's opinion shall be considered a medical report subject to the limitations of § 725.414.</P>
              <P>(d) A physician whose testimony is permitted under this section may testify as to any other medical evidence of record, but shall not be permitted to testify as to any medical evidence relevant to the miner's condition that is not admissible.</P>

No post-hearing deposition or interrogatory shall be permitted unless authorized by the administrative law judge upon the motion of a party to the claim.

              <P>(a) A witness testifying at a hearing before an administrative law judge, or whose deposition is taken, shall receive the same fees and mileage as witnesses in courts of the United States. If the witness is an expert, he or she shall be entitled to an expert witness fee. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, such fees shall be paid by the proponent of the witness.</P>
              <P>(b) If the witness' proponent does not intend to call the witness to appear at a hearing or deposition, any other party may subpoena the witness for cross-examination. The administrative law judge (ALJ) shall authorize the least intrusive and expensive means of cross-examination as the ALJ deems appropriate and necessary to the full and true disclosure of the facts. If such witness is required to attend the hearing, give a deposition or respond to interrogatories for cross-examination purposes, the proponent of the witness shall pay the witness' fee. The fund shall remain liable for any costs associated with the cross-examination of the physician who performed the complete pulmonary evaluation pursuant to § 725.406.</P>

              <P>(c) If a claimant is determined entitled to benefits, there may be assessed <PRTPAGE P="558"/>as costs against a responsible operator, if any, or the fund, fees and mileage for necessary witnesses attending the hearing at the request of the claimant. Both the necessity for the witness and the reasonableness of the fees of any expert witness shall be approved by the administrative law judge. The amounts awarded against a responsible operator or the fund as attorney's fees, or costs, fees and mileage for witnesses, shall not in any respect affect or diminish benefits payable under the Act.</P>

Such waiver may be withdrawn by a party for good cause shown at any time prior to the mailing of the decision in the claim.

Where a waiver has been filed by all parties, and they do not appear before the administrative law judge personally or by representative, the administrative law judge shall make a record of the relevant documentary evidence submitted in accordance with this part and any further written stipulations of the parties. Such documents and stipulations shall be considered the evidence of record in the case and the decision shall be based upon such evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in § 725.456(a), the unexcused failure of any party to attend a hearing shall constitute a waiver of such party's right to present evidence at the hearing, and may result in a dismissal of the claim (see § 725.465).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Statutory provisions and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) One of the major purposes of the black lung benefits amendments of 1977 was to provide a more effective means of transferring the responsibility for the payment of benefits from the Federal government to the coal industry with respect to claims filed under this part. In furtherance of this goal, a Black Lung Disability Trust Fund financed by the coal industry was established by the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977. The primary purpose of the Fund is to pay benefits with respect to all claims in which the last coal mine employment of the miner on whose account the claim was filed occurred before January 1, 1970. With respect to most claims in which the miner's last coal mine employment occurred after January 1, 1970, individual coal mine operators will be liable for the payment of benefits. The 1981 amendments to the Act relieved individual coal mine operators from the liability for payment of certain special claims involving coal mine employment on or after January 1, 1970, where the claim was previously denied and subsequently approved under section 435 of the Act. See § 725.496 for a detailed description of these special claims. Where no such operator exists or the operator determined to be liable is in default in any case, the fund shall pay the benefits due and seek reimbursement as is appropriate. See also § 725.420 for the fund's role in the payment of interim benefits in certain contested cases. In addition, the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 amended certain provisions affecting the scope of coverage under the Act and describing the effects of particular corporate transactions on the liability of operators.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this subpart define the term “operator” and prescribe the manner in which the identity of an operator which may be liable for the payment of benefits—referred to herein as a “responsible operator”—will be determined.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 725.491</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Operator defined.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of this part, the term “operator” shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) Any owner, lessee, or other person who operates, controls, or supervises a coal mine, or any independent contractor performing services or construction at such mine; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any other person who:</P>
              <P>(i) Employs an individual in the transportation of coal or in coal mine construction in or around a coal mine, to the extent such individual was exposed to coal mine dust as a result of such employment (see § 725.202);</P>
              <P>(ii) In accordance with the provisions of § 725.492, may be considered a successor operator; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Paid wages or a salary, or provided other benefits, to an individual in exchange for work as a miner (see § 725.202).</P>
              <P>(b) The terms “owner,” “lessee,” and “person” shall include any individual, partnership, association, corporation, firm, subsidiary of a corporation, or other organization, as appropriate, except that an officer of a corporation shall not be considered an “operator” for purposes of this part. Following the issuance of an order awarding benefits against a corporation that has not secured its liability for benefits in accordance with section 423 of the Act and § 726.4, such order may be enforced against the president, secretary, or treasurer of the corporation in accordance with subpart I of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) The term “independent contractor” shall include any person who contracts to perform services. Such contractor's status as an operator shall not be contingent upon the amount or percentage of its work or business related to activities in or around a mine, nor upon the number or percentage of <PRTPAGE P="562"/>its employees engaged in such activities.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purposes of determining whether a person is or was an operator that may be found liable for the payment of benefits under this part, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that during the course of an individual's employment with such employer, such individual was regularly and continuously exposed to coal mine dust during the course of employment. The presumption may be rebutted by a showing that the employee was not exposed to coal mine dust for significant periods during such employment.</P>
              <P>(e) The operation, control, or supervision referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be exercised directly or indirectly. Thus, for example, where a coal mine is leased, and the lease empowers the lessor to make decisions with respect to the terms and conditions under which coal is to be extracted or prepared, such as, but not limited to, the manner of extraction or preparation or the amount of coal to be produced, the lessor may be considered an operator. Similarly, any parent entity or other controlling business entity may be considered an operator for purposes of this part, regardless of the nature of its business activities.</P>
              <P>(f) Neither the United States, nor any State, nor any instrumentality or agency of the United States or any State, shall be considered an operator.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Successor operator defined.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any person who, on or after January 1, 1970, acquired a mine or mines, or substantially all of the assets thereof, from a prior operator, or acquired the coal mining business of such prior operator, or substantially all of the assets thereof, shall be considered a “successor operator” with respect to any miners previously employed by such prior operator.</P>
              <P>(b) The following transactions shall also be deemed to create successor operator liability:</P>
              <P>(1) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a reorganization which involves a change in identity, form, or place of business or organization, however effected;</P>
              <P>(2) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a liquidation into a parent or successor corporation; or</P>
              <P>(3) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a sale of substantially all its assets, or as a result of merger, consolidation, or division.</P>
              <P>(c) In any case in which a transaction specified in paragraph (b), or substantially similar to a transaction specified in paragraph (b), took place, the resulting entity shall be considered a “successor operator” with respect to any miners previously employed by such prior operator.</P>
              <P>(d) This section shall not be construed to relieve a prior operator of any liability if such prior operator meets the conditions set forth in § 725.494. If the prior operator does not meet the conditions set forth in § 725.494, the following provisions shall apply:</P>
              <P>(1) In any case in which a prior operator transferred a mine or mines, or substantially all of the assets thereof, to a successor operator, or sold its coal mining business or substantially all of the assets thereof, to a successor operator, and then ceased to exist within the terms of paragraph (b), the successor operator as identified in paragraph (a) shall be primarily liable for the payment of benefits to any miners previously employed by such prior operator.</P>
              <P>(2) In any case in which a prior operator transferred mines, or substantially all of the assets thereof, to more than one successor operator, the successor operator that most recently acquired a mine or mines or assets from the prior operator shall be primarily liable for the payment of benefits to any miners previously employed by such prior operator.</P>

              <P>(3) In any case in which a mine or mines, or substantially all the assets thereof, have been transferred more than once, the successor operator that most recently acquired such mine or mines or assets shall be primarily liable for the payment of benefits to any miners previously employed by the original prior operator. If the most recent successor operator does not meet the criteria for a potentially liable operator set forth in § 725.494, the next <PRTPAGE P="563"/>most recent successor operator shall be liable.</P>
              <P>(e) An “acquisition,” for purposes of this section, shall include any transaction by which title to the mine or mines, or substantially all of the assets thereof, or the right to extract or prepare coal at such mine or mines, becomes vested in a person other than the prior operator.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 725.493</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Employment relationship defined.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) In determining the identity of a responsible operator under this part, the terms “employ” and “employment” shall be construed as broadly as possible, and shall include any relationship under which an operator retains the right to direct, control, or supervise the work performed by a miner, or any other relationship under which an operator derives a benefit from the work performed by a miner. Any individuals who participate with one or more persons in the mining of coal, such as owners, proprietors, partners, and joint venturers, whether they are compensated by wages, salaries, piece rates, shares, profits, or by any other means, shall be deemed employees. It is the specific intention of this paragraph to disregard any financial arrangement or business entity devised by the actual owners or operators of a coal mine or coal mine-related enterprise to avoid the payment of benefits to miners who, based upon the economic reality of their relationship to this enterprise, are, in fact, employees of the enterprise.</P>
              <P>(2) The payment of wages or salary shall be prima facie evidence of the right to direct, control, or supervise an individual's work. The Department intends that where the operator who paid a miner's wages or salary meets the criteria for a potentially liable operator set forth in § 725.494, that operator shall be primarily liable for the payment of any benefits due the miner as a result of such employment. The absence of such payment, however, will not negate the existence of an employment relationship. Thus, the Department also intends that where the person who paid a miner's wages may not be considered a potentially liable operator, any other operator who retained the right to direct, control or supervise the work performed by the miner, or who benefitted from such work, may be considered a potentially liable operator.</P>
              <P>(b) This paragraph contains examples of relationships that shall be considered employment relationships for purposes of this part. The list is not intended to be exclusive.</P>
              <P>(1) In any case in which an operator may be considered a successor operator, as determined in accordance with § 725.492, any employment with a prior operator shall also be deemed to be employment with the successor operator. In a case in which the miner was not independently employed by the successor operator, the prior operator shall remain primarily liable for the payment of any benefits based on the miner's employment with the prior operator. In a case in which the miner was independently employed by the successor operator after the transaction giving rise to successor operator liability, the successor operator shall be primarily liable for the payment of any benefits.</P>
              <P>(2) In any case in which the operator which directed, controlled or supervised the miner is no longer in business and such operator was a subsidiary of a parent company, a member of a joint venture, a partner in a partnership, or was substantially owned or controlled by another business entity, such parent entity or other member of a joint venture or partner or controlling business entity may be considered the employer of any employees of such operator.</P>
              <P>(3) In any claim in which the operator which directed, controlled or supervised the miner is a lessee, the lessee shall be considered primarily liable for the claim. The liability of the lessor may be established only after it has been determined that the lessee is unable to provide for the payment of benefits to a successful claimant. In any case involving the liability of a lessor for a claim arising out of employment with a lessee, any determination of lessor liability shall be made on the basis of the facts present in the case in accordance with the following considerations:</P>

              <P>(i) Where a coal mine is leased, and the lease empowers the lessor to make <PRTPAGE P="564"/>decisions with respect to the terms and conditions under which coal is to be extracted or prepared, such as, but not limited to, the manner of extraction or preparation or the amount of coal to be produced, the lessor shall be considered the employer of any employees of the lessee.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where a coal mine is leased to a self-employed operator, the lessor shall be considered the employer of such self-employed operator and its employees if the lease or agreement is executed or renewed after August 18, 1978 and such lease or agreement does not require the lessee to guarantee the payment of benefits which may be required under this part and part 726 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Where a lessor previously operated a coal mine, it may be considered an operator with respect to employees of any lessee of such mine, particularly where the leasing arrangement was executed or renewed after August 18, 1978 and does not require the lessee to secure benefits provided by the Act.</P>
              <P>(4) A self-employed operator, depending upon the facts of the case, may be considered an employee of any other operator, person, or business entity which substantially controls, supervises, or is financially responsible for the activities of the self-employed operator.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Potentially liable operators.</SUBJECT>
              <P>An operator may be considered a “potentially liable operator” with respect to a claim for benefits under this part if each of the following conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(a) The miner's disability or death arose at least in part out of employment in or around a mine or other facility during a period when the mine or facility was operated by such operator, or by a person with respect to which the operator may be considered a successor operator. For purposes of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the miner's disability or death arose in whole or in part out of his or her employment with such operator. Unless this presumption is rebutted, the responsible operator shall be liable to pay benefits to the claimant on account of the disability or death of the miner in accordance with this part. A miner's pneumoconiosis, or disability or death therefrom, shall be considered to have arisen in whole or in part out of work in or around a mine if such work caused, contributed to or aggravated the progression or advancement of a miner's loss of ability to perform his or her regular coal mine employment or comparable employment.</P>
              <P>(b) The operator, or any person with respect to which the operator may be considered a successor operator, was an operator for any period after June 30, 1973.</P>
              <P>(c) The miner was employed by the operator, or any person with respect to which the operator may be considered a successor operator, for a cumulative period of not less than one year (§ 725.101(a)(32)).</P>
              <P>(d) The miner's employment with the operator, or any person with respect to which the operator may be considered a successor operator, included at least one working day (§ 725.101(a)(32)) after December 31, 1969.</P>
              <P>(e) The operator is capable of assuming its liability for the payment of continuing benefits under this part. An operator will be deemed capable of assuming its liability for a claim if one of the following three conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(1) The operator obtained a policy or contract of insurance under section 423 of the Act and part 726 of this subchapter that covers the claim, except that such policy shall not be considered sufficient to establish the operator's capability of assuming liability if the insurance company has been declared insolvent and its obligations for the claim are not otherwise guaranteed;</P>
              <P>(2) The operator qualified as a self-insurer under section 423 of the Act and part 726 of this subchapter during the period in which the miner was last employed by the operator, provided that the operator still qualifies as a self-insurer or the security given by the operator pursuant to § 726.104(b) is sufficient to secure the payment of benefits in the event the claim is awarded; or</P>
              <P>(3) The operator possesses sufficient assets to secure the payment of benefits in the event the claim is awarded in accordance with § 725.606.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for determining a responsible operator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The operator responsible for the payment of benefits in a claim adjudicated under this part (the “responsible operator”) shall be the potentially liable operator, as determined in accordance with § 725.494, that most recently employed the miner.</P>
              <P>(2) If more than one potentially liable operator may be deemed to have employed the miner most recently, then the liability for any benefits payable as a result of such employment shall be assigned as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) First, to the potentially liable operator that directed, controlled, or supervised the miner;</P>
              <P>(ii) Second, to any potentially liable operator that may be considered a successor operator with respect to miners employed by the operator identified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Third, to any other potentially liable operator which may be deemed to have been the miner's most recent employer pursuant to § 725.493.</P>
              <P>(3) If the operator that most recently employed the miner may not be considered a potentially liable operator, as determined in accordance with § 725.494, the responsible operator shall be the potentially liable operator that next most recently employed the miner. Any potentially liable operator that employed the miner for at least one day after December 31, 1969 may be deemed the responsible operator if no more recent employer may be considered a potentially liable operator.</P>
              <P>(4) If the miner's most recent employment by an operator ended while the operator was authorized to self-insure its liability under part 726 of this title, and that operator no longer possesses sufficient assets to secure the payment of benefits, the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) shall be inapplicable with respect to any operator that employed the miner only before he was employed by such self-insured operator. If no operator that employed the miner after his employment with the self-insured operator meets the conditions of § 725.494, the claim of the miner or his survivor shall be the responsibility of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in this section and § 725.408(a)(3), with respect to the adjudication of the identity of a responsible operator, the Director shall bear the burden of proving that the responsible operator initially found liable for the payment of benefits pursuant to § 725.410 (the “designated responsible operator”) is a potentially liable operator. It shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the designated responsible operator is capable of assuming liability for the payment of benefits in accordance with § 725.494(e).</P>
              <P>(c) The designated responsible operator shall bear the burden of proving either:</P>
              <P>(1) That it does not possess sufficient assets to secure the payment of benefits in accordance with § 725.606; or</P>
              <P>(2) That it is not the potentially liable operator that most recently employed the miner. Such proof must include evidence that the miner was employed as a miner after he or she stopped working for the designated responsible operator and that the person by whom he or she was employed is a potentially liable operator within the meaning of § 725.494. In order to establish that a more recent employer is a potentially liable operator, the designated responsible operator must demonstrate that the more recent employer possesses sufficient assets to secure the payment of benefits in accordance with § 725.606. The designated responsible operator may satisfy its burden by presenting evidence that the owner, if the more recent employer is a sole proprietorship; the partners, if the more recent employer is a partnership; or the president, secretary, and treasurer, if the more recent employer is a corporation that failed to secure the payment of benefits pursuant to part 726 of this subchapter, possess assets sufficient to secure the payment of benefits, provided such assets may be reached in a proceeding brought under subpart I of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) In any case referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges pursuant to § 725.421 in which the operator finally designated as responsible pursuant to § 725.418(d) is not the operator that most recently employed the <PRTPAGE P="566"/>miner, the record shall contain a statement from the district director explaining the reasons for such designation. If the reasons include the most recent employer's failure to meet the conditions of § 725.494(e), the record shall also contain a statement that the Office has searched the files it maintains pursuant to part 726, and that the Office has no record of insurance coverage for that employer, or of authorization to self-insure, that meets the conditions of § 725.494(e)(1) or (e)(2). Such a statement shall be prima facie evidence that the most recent employer is not financially capable of assuming its liability for a claim. In the absence of such a statement, it shall be presumed that the most recent employer is financially capable of assuming its liability for a claim.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special claims transferred to the fund.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The 1981 amendments to the Act amended section 422 of the Act and transferred liability for payment of certain special claims from operators and carriers to the fund. These provisions apply to claims which were denied before March 1, 1978, and which have been or will be approved in accordance with section 435 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Section 402(i) of the Act defines three classes of denied claims subject to the transfer provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) Claims filed with and denied by the Social Security Administration before March 1, 1978;</P>
              <P>(2) Claims filed with the Department of Labor in which the claimant was notified by the Department of an administrative or informal denial before March 1, 1977, and in which the claimant did not within one year of such notification either:</P>
              <P>(i) Request a hearing; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Present additional evidence; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Indicate an intention to present additional evidence; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Request a modification or reconsideration of the denial on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact;</P>
              <P>(3) Claims filed with the Department of Labor and denied under the law in effect prior to the enactment of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, that is, before March 1, 1978, following a formal hearing before an administrative law judge or administrative review before the Benefits Review Board or review before a United States Court of Appeals.</P>
              <P>(c) Where more than one claim was filed with the Social Security Administration and/or the Department of Labor prior to March 1, 1978, by or on behalf of a miner or a surviving dependent of a miner, unless such claims were required to be merged by the agency's regulations, the procedural history of each such claim must be considered separately to determine whether the claim is subject to the transfer of liability provisions.</P>
              <P>(d) For a claim filed with and denied by the Social Security Administration prior to March 1, 1978, to come within the transfer provisions, such claim must have been or must be approved under the provisions of section 435 of the Act. No claim filed with and denied by the Social Security Administration is subject to the transfer of liability provisions unless a request was made by or on behalf of the claimant for review of such denied claim under section 435. Such review must have been requested by the filing of a valid election card or other equivalent document with the Social Security Administration in accordance with section 435(a) and its implementing regulations at 20 CFR 410.700 through 410.707.</P>
              <P>(e) Where a claim filed with the Department of Labor prior to March 1, 1977, was subjected to repeated administrative or informal denials, the last such denial issued during the pendency of the claim determines whether the claim is subject to the transfer of liability provisions.</P>

              <P>(f) Where a miner's claim comes within the transfer of liability provisions of the 1981 amendments the fund is also liable for the payment of any benefits to which the miner's dependent survivors are entitled after the miner's death. However, if the survivor's entitlement was established on a separate claim not subject to the transfer of liability provisions prior to approval of the miner's claim under section 435, the party responsible for the payment of such survivors' benefits shall not be relieved of that responsibility because the miner's claim was <PRTPAGE P="567"/>ultimately approved and found subject to the transfer of liability provisions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures in special claims transferred to the fund.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> It is the purpose of this section to define procedures to expedite the handling and disposition of claims affected by the benefit liability transfer provisions of Section 205 of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Action by the Department.</E> The OWCP shall, in accordance with the criteria contained in § 725.496, review each claim which is or may be affected by the provisions of Section 205 of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981. Any party to a claim, adjudication officer, or adjudicative body may request that such a review be conducted and that the record be supplemented with any additional documentation necessary for an informed consideration of the transferability of the claim. Where the issue of the transferability of the claim can not be resolved by agreement of the parties and the evidence of record is not sufficient for a resolution of the issue, the hearing record may be reopened or the case remanded for the development of the additional evidence concerning the procedural history of the claim necessary to such resolution. Such determinations shall be made on an expedited basis.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Dismissal of operators.</E> If it is determined that a coal mine operator or insurance carrier which previously participated in the consideration or adjudication of any claim, may no longer be found liable for the payment of benefits to the claimant by reason of section 205 of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, such operator or carrier shall be promptly dismissed as a party to the claim. The dismissal of an operator or carrier shall be concluded at the earliest possible time and in no event shall an operator or carrier participate as a necessary party in any claim for which only the fund may be liable.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure following dismissal of an operator.</E> After it has been determined that an operator or carrier must be dismissed as a party in any claim in accordance with this section, the Director shall take such action as is authorized by the Act to bring about the proper and expeditious resolution of the claim in light of all relevant medical and other evidence. Action to be taken in this regard by the Director may include, but is not limited to, the assignment of the claim to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund for the payment of benefits, the reimbursement of benefits previously paid by an operator or carrier if appropriate, the defense of the claim on behalf of the fund, or proceedings authorized by § 725.310.</P>
              <P>(e) Any claimant whose claim has been subsequently denied in a modification proceeding will be entitled to expedited review of the modification decision. Where a formal hearing was previously held, the claimant may waive his right to a further hearing and ask that a decision be made on the record of the prior hearing, as supplemented by any additional documentary evidence which the parties wish to introduce and briefs of the parties, if desired. In any case in which the claimant waives his right to a second hearing, a decision and order must be issued within 30 days of the date upon which the parties agree the record has been completed.</P>

                <P>The provisions of this subpart govern the payment of benefits to claimants whose claims are approved for payment under section 415 and part C of title IV of the Act or approved after review under section 435 of the Act and part 727 of this subchapter (see § 725.4(d)).</P>

                <SUBJECT>When benefit payments are due; manner of payment.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a)(1) Except with respect to benefits paid by the fund pursuant to an initial determination issued in accordance with § 725.418 (see § 725.522), benefits under the Act shall be paid when they become due. Benefits shall be considered due after the issuance of an effective order requiring the payment of <PRTPAGE P="568"/>benefits by a district director, administrative law judge, Benefits Review Board, or court, notwithstanding the pendency of a motion for reconsideration before an administrative law judge or an appeal to the Board or court, except that benefits shall not be considered due where the payment of such benefits has been stayed by the Benefits Review Board or appropriate court. An effective order shall remain in effect unless it is vacated by an administrative law judge on reconsideration, or, upon review under section 21 of the LHWCA, by the Benefits Review Board or an appropriate court, or is superseded by an effective order issued pursuant to § 725.310.</P>
                <P>(2) A proposed order issued by a district director pursuant to § 725.418 becomes effective at the expiration of the thirtieth day thereafter if no party timely requests revision of the proposed decision and order or a hearing (see § 725.419). An order issued by an administrative law judge becomes effective when it is filed in the office of the district director (see § 725.479). An order issued by the Benefits Review Board shall become effective when it is issued. An order issued by a court shall become effective in accordance with the rules of the court.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) While an effective order requiring the payment of benefits remains in effect, monthly benefits, at the rates set forth in § 725.520, shall be due on the fifteenth day of the month following the month for which the benefits are payable. For example, benefits payable for the month of January shall be due on the fifteenth day of February.</P>
                <P>(2) Within 30 days after the issuance of an effective order requiring the payment of benefits, the district director shall compute the amount of benefits payable for periods prior to the effective date of the order, in addition to any interest payable for such periods (see § 725.608), and shall so notify the parties. Any computation made by the district director under this paragraph shall strictly observe the terms of the order. Benefits and interest payable for such periods shall be due on the thirtieth day following issuance of the district director's computation. A copy of the current table of applicable interest rates shall be attached to the computation.</P>
                <P>(c) Benefits are payable for monthly periods and shall be paid directly to an eligible claimant or his or her representative payee (see § 725.510) beginning with the month during which eligibility begins. Benefit payments shall terminate with the month before the month during which eligibility terminates. If a claimant dies in the first month during which all requirements for eligibility are met, benefits shall be paid for that month.</P>

                <P>(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 6(a) of the Longshore Act as incorporated by section 422(a) of the Act, and except as provided in § 725.504, the provisions of this section shall be applicable in determining the date from which benefits are payable to an eligible claimant for any claim filed after March 31, 1980. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the date from which benefits are payable for any claim approved under part 727 shall be determined in accordance with § 727.302 (see § 725.4(d)).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Miner's claim.</E> Benefits are payable to a miner who is entitled beginning with the month of onset of total disability due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment. Where the evidence does not establish the month of onset, benefits shall be payable to such miner beginning with the month during which the claim was filed. In the case of a miner who filed a claim before January 1, 1982, benefits shall be payable to the miner's eligible survivor (if any) beginning with the month in which the miner died.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Survivor's claim.</E> Benefits are payable to a survivor who is entitled beginning with the month of the miner's death, or January 1, 1974, whichever is later.</P>
                <P>(d) If a claim is awarded pursuant to section 22 of the Longshore Act and § 725.310, then the date from which benefits are payable shall be determined as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Mistake in fact.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, as <PRTPAGE P="569"/>applicable, shall govern the determination of the date from which benefits are payable.</P>

Where the evidence does not establish the month of onset, benefits shall be payable to such miner from the month in which the claimant requested modification.</P>
                <P>(e) In the case of a claim filed between July 1, 1973, and December 31, 1973, benefits shall be payable as provided by this section, except to the extent prohibited by § 727.303 (see § 725.4(d)).</P>
                <P>(f) No benefits shall be payable with respect to a claim filed after December 31, 1973 (a part C claim), for any period of eligibility occurring before January 1, 1974.</P>
                <P>(g) Each decision and order awarding benefits shall indicate the month from which benefits are payable to the eligible claimant.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payments to a claimant employed as a miner.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In the case of a claimant who is employed as a miner (see § 725.202) at the time of a final determination of such miner's eligibility for benefits, no benefits shall be payable unless:</P>
                <P>(1) The miner's eligibility is established under section 411(c)(3) of the Act; or</P>
                <P>(2) the miner terminates his or her coal mine employment within 1 year from the date of the final determination of the claim.</P>
                <P>(b) If the eligibility of a working miner is established under section 411(c)(3) of the Act, benefits shall be payable as is otherwise provided in this part. If eligibility cannot be established under section 411(c)(3), and the miner continues to be employed as a miner in any capacity for a period of less than 1 year after a final determination of the claim, benefits shall be payable beginning with the month during which the miner ends his or her coal mine employment. If the miner's employment continues for more than 1 year after a final determination of eligibility, such determination shall be considered a denial of benefits on the basis of the miner's continued employment, and the miner may seek benefits only as provided in § 725.310, if applicable, or by filing a new claim under this part. The provisions of Subparts E and F of this part shall be applicable to claims considered under this section as is appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) In any case where the miner returns to coal mine or comparable and gainful work, the payments to such miner shall be suspended and no benefits shall be payable (except as provided in section 411(c)(3) of the Act) for the period during which the miner continues to work. If the miner again terminates employment, the district director may require the miner to submit to further medical examination before authorizing the payment of benefits.</P>

                <P>(a) If the district director determines that the best interests of a beneficiary are served thereby, the district director may certify the payment of such beneficiary's benefits to a representative payee.</P>
                <P>(b) Before any amount shall be certified for payment to any representative payee for or on behalf of a beneficiary, such representative payee shall submit to the district director such evidence as may be required of his or her relationship to, or his or her responsibility for the care of, the beneficiary on whose behalf payment is to be made, or of his or her authority to receive such a payment. The district director may, at any time thereafter, require evidence of the continued existence of such relationship, responsibility, or authority. If a person requesting representative payee status fails to submit the required evidence within a reasonable period of time after it is requested, no further payments shall be certified to him or her on behalf of the beneficiary unless the required evidence is thereafter submitted.</P>
                <P>(c) All benefit payments made to a representative payee shall be available only for the use and benefit of the beneficiary, as defined in § 725.511.</P>

                <P>(a) Payments certified to a representative payee shall be considered as having been applied for the use and benefit of the beneficiary when they are used for the beneficiary's current maintenance—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> to replace current income lost because of the disability of the beneficiary. Where a beneficiary is receiving care in an institution, current maintenance shall include the customary charges made by the institution and charges made for the current and foreseeable needs of the beneficiary which are not met by the institution.</P>

                <P>(b) Payments certified to a representative payee which are not needed for the current maintenance of the beneficiary, except as they may be used under § 725.512, shall be conserved or invested on the beneficiary's behalf. Preferred investments are U.S. savings bonds which shall be purchased in accordance with applicable regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department (31 CFR part 315). Surplus funds may also be invested in accordance with the rules applicable to investment of trust estates by trustees. For example, surplus funds may be deposited in an interest or dividend bearing account in a bank or trust company or in a savings and loan association if the account is either federally insured or is otherwise insured in accordance with State law requirements. Surplus funds deposited in an interest or dividend bearing account in a bank or trust company or in a savings and loan association must be in a form of account which clearly shows that the representative payee has only a fiduciary, and not a personal, interest in the funds. The preferred forms of such accounts are as follows:

                <SUBJECT>Computation of benefits.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rate.</E> The amount of benefits payable to a beneficiary for a month is determined, in the first instance, by computing the “basic rate.” The basic rate is equal to 37<FR>1/2</FR> percent of the monthly pay rate for Federal employees in GS-2, step 1. That rate for a month is determined by:</P>
                <P>(1) Ascertaining the lowest annual rate of pay (step 1) for Grade GS-2 of the General Schedule applicable to such month (see 5 U.S.C. 5332);</P>
                <P>(2) Ascertaining the monthly rate thereof by dividing the amount determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by 12; and</P>
                <P>(3) Ascertaining the basic rate under the Act by multiplying the amount determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by 0.375 (that is, by 37<FR>1/2</FR> percent).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic benefit.</E> When a miner or surviving spouse is entitled to benefits for a month for which he or she has no dependents who qualify under this part and when a surviving child of a miner or spouse, or a parent, brother, or sister of a miner, is entitled to benefits for a month for which he or she is the only beneficiary entitled to benefits, the amount of benefits to which such beneficiary is entitled is equal to the basic rate as computed in accordance <PRTPAGE P="572"/>with this section (raised, if not a multiple of 10 cents, to the next high multiple of 10 cents). This amount is referred to as the “basic benefit.”</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Augmented benefit.</E> (1) When a miner or surviving spouse is entitled to benefits for a month for which he or she has one or more dependents who qualify under this part, the amount of benefits to which such miner or surviving spouse is entitled is increased. This increase is referred to as an “augmentation.”</P>
                <P>(2) The benefits of a miner or surviving spouse are augmented to take account of a particular dependent beginning with the first month in which such dependent satisfies the conditions set forth in this part, and continues to be augmented through the month before the month in which such dependent ceases to satisfy the conditions set forth in this part, except in the case of a child who qualifies as a dependent because he or she is a student. In the latter case, such benefits continue to be augmented through the month before the first month during no part of which he or she qualifies as a student.</P>
                <P>(3) The basic rate is augmented by 50 percent for one such dependent, 75 percent for two such dependents, and 100 percent for three or more such dependents.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Survivor benefits.</E> As used in this section, “survivor” means a surviving child of a miner or surviving spouse, or a surviving parent, brother, or sister of a miner, who establishes entitlement to benefits under this part.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Computation and rounding.</E> (1) Any computation prescribed by this section is made to the third decimal place.</P>
                <P>(2) Monthly benefits are payable in multiples of 10 cents. Therefore, a monthly payment of amounts derived under paragraph (c)(3) of this section which is not a multiple of 10 cents is increased to the next higher multiple of 10 cents.</P>
                <P>(3) Since a fraction of a cent is not a multiple of 10 cents, such an amount which contains a fraction in the third decimal place is raised to the next higher multiple of 10 cents.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Eligibility based on the coal mine employment of more than one miner.</E> Where an individual, for any month, is entitled (and/or qualifies as a dependent for purposes of augmentation of benefits) based on the disability or death due to pneumoconiosis arising out of the coal mine employment of more than one miner, the benefit payable to or on behalf of such individual shall be at a rate equal to the highest rate of benefits for which entitlement is established by reason of eligibility as a beneficiary, or by reason of his or her qualification as a dependent for augmentation of benefit purposes.</P>

                <P>(a) Whenever the district director determines that it is in the interest of justice, the liability for benefits or any part thereof as determined by a final adjudication, may, with the approval of the Director, be discharged by the payment of a lump sum equal to the present value of future benefit payments commuted, computed at 4 percent true discount compounded annually.</P>
                <P>(b) Applications for commutation of future payments of benefits shall be made to the district director in the manner prescribed by the district director. If the district director determines that an award of a lump sum payment of such benefits would be in the interest of justice, he or she shall refer such application, together with the reasons in support of such determination, to the Director for consideration.</P>
                <P>(c) The Director shall, in his or her discretion, grant or deny the application for commutation of payments. Such decision may be appealed to the Benefits Review Board.</P>
                <P>(d) The computation of all commutations of such benefits shall be made by the OWCP. For this purpose the file shall contain the date of birth of the person on whose behalf commutation is sought, as well as the date upon which such commutation shall be effective.</P>

                <P>(e) For purposes of determining the amount of any lump sum award, the probability of the death of the disabled miner and/or other persons entitled to benefits before the expiration of the period during which he or she is entitled to benefits, shall be determined in accordance with the most current United <PRTPAGE P="573"/>States Life Tables, as developed by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the probability of the remarriage of a surviving spouse shall be determined in accordance with the remarriage tables of the Dutch Royal Insurance Institution. The probability of the happening of any other contingency affecting the amount or duration of the compensation shall be disregarded.</P>
                <P>(f) In the event that an operator or carrier is adjudicated liable for the payment of benefits, such operator or carrier shall be notified of and given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings to determine whether a lump sum award shall be made. Such operator or carrier shall, in the event a lump sum award is made, tender full and prompt payment of such award to the claimant as though such award were a final payment of monthly benefits. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, such lump sum award shall forever discharge such operator or carrier from its responsibility to make monthly benefit payments under the Act to the person who has requested such lump-sum award. In the event that an operator or carrier is adjudicated liable for the payment of benefits, such operator or carrier shall not be liable for any portion of a commuted or lump sum award predicated upon benefits due any claimant prior to January 1, 1974.</P>
                <P>(g) In the event a lump-sum award is approved under this section, such award shall not operate to discharge an operator carrier, or the fund from any responsibility imposed by the Act for the payment of medical benefits to an eligible miner.</P>

An operator that fails to pay any benefits that are due, with interest, shall be considered in default with respect to those benefits, and the provisions of § 725.605 of this part shall be applicable. In addition, a claimant who does not receive any benefits within 10 days of the date they become due is entitled to additional compensation equal to twenty percent of those benefits (see § 725.607).

                <SUBJECT>Modification of benefits amounts; general.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Under certain circumstances, the amount of monthly benefits as computed in § 725.520 or lump-sum award (§ 725.521) shall be modified to determine the amount actually to be paid to a beneficiary. With respect to any benefits payable for all periods of eligibility after January 1, 1974, a reduction of the amount of benefits payable shall be required on account of:</P>
                <P>(1) Any compensation or benefits received under any State workers' compensation law because of death or partial or total disability due to pneumoconiosis; or</P>
                <P>(2) Any compensation or benefits received under or pursuant to any Federal law including part B of title IV of the Act because of death or partial or total disability due to pneumoconiosis; or</P>
                <P>(3) In the case of benefits to a parent, brother, or sister as a result of a claim filed at any time or benefits payable on a miner's claim which was filed on or after January 1, 1982, the excess earnings from wages and from net earnings from self-employment (see § 410.530 of this title) of such parent, brother, sister, or miner, respectively; or</P>
                <P>(4) The fact that a claim for benefits from an additional beneficiary is filed, or that such claim is effective for a payment during the month of filing, or a dependent qualifies under this part for an augmentation portion of a benefit of a miner or widow for a period in which another dependent has previously qualified for an augmentation.</P>
                <P>(b) An adjustment in a beneficiary's monthly benefit may be required because an overpayment or underpayment has been made to such beneficiary (see §§ 725.540-725.546).</P>
                <P>(c) A suspension of a beneficiary's monthly benefits may be required when the Office has information indicating that reductions on account of excess earnings may reasonably be expected.</P>
                <P>(d) Monthly benefit rates are payable in multiples of 10 cents. Any monthly benefit rate which, after the applicable computations, augmentations, and reductions is not a multiple of 10 cents, is increased to the next higher multiple of 10 cents. Since a fraction of a cent is not a multiple of 10 cents, a benefit rate which contains such a fraction in the third decimal is raised to the next higher multiple of 10 cents.</P>

                <P>(e) Any individual entitled to a benefit, who is aware of any circumstances which could affect entitlement to benefits, eligibility for payment, or the <PRTPAGE P="575"/>amount of benefits, or result in the termination, suspension, or reduction of benefits, shall promptly report these circumstances to the Office. The Office may at any time require an individual receiving, or claiming entitlement to, benefits, either on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another, to submit a written statement giving pertinent information bearing upon the issue of whether or not an event has occurred which would cause such benefit to be terminated, or which would subject such benefit to reductions or suspension under the provisions of the Act. The failure of an individual to submit any such report or statement, properly executed, to the Office shall subject such benefit to reductions, suspension, or termination as the case may be.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reductions; receipt of State or Federal benefit.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) As used in this section the term “State or Federal benefit” means a payment to an individual on account of total or partial disability or death due to pneumoconiosis only under State or Federal laws relating to workers' compensation. With respect to a claim for which benefits are payable for any month between July 1 and December 31, 1973, “State benefit” means a payment to a beneficiary made on account of disability or death due to pneumoconiosis under State laws relating to workers' compensation (including compensation for occupational disease), unemployment compensation, or disability insurance.</P>
                <P>(b) Benefit payments to a beneficiary for any month are reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to any payments of State or Federal benefits received by such beneficiary for such month.</P>
                <P>(c) Where a State or Federal benefit is paid periodically but not monthly, or in a lump sum as a commutation of or a substitution for periodic benefits, the reduction under this section is made at such time or times and in such amounts as the Office determines will approximate as nearly as practicable the reduction required under paragraph (b) of this section. In making such a determination, a weekly State or Federal benefit is multiplied by 4<FR>1/3</FR> and a biweekly benefit is multiplied by 2<FR>1/6</FR> to ascertain the monthly equivalent for reduction purposes.</P>
                <P>(d) Amounts paid or incurred or to be incurred by the individual for medical, legal, or related expenses in connection with this claim for State or Federal benefits (defined in paragraph (a) of this section) are excluded in computing the reduction under paragraph (b) of this section, to the extent that they are consistent with State or Federal Law. Such medical, legal, or related expenses may be evidenced by the State or Federal benefit awards, compromise agreement, or court order in the State or Federal benefit proceedings, or by such other evidence as the Office may require. Such other evidence may consist of:</P>
                <P>(1) A detailed statement by the individual's attorney, physician, or the employer's insurance carrier; or</P>
                <P>(2) Bills, receipts, or canceled checks; or</P>
                <P>(3) Other evidence indicating the amount of such expenses; or</P>
                <P>(4) Any combination of the foregoing evidence from which the amount of such expenses may be determinable. Such expenses shall not be excluded unless established by evidence as required by the Office.</P>

                <P>In the case of a surviving parent, brother, or sister, whose claim was filed at any time, or of a miner whose claim was filed on or after January 1, 1982, benefit payments are reduced as appropriate by an amount equal to the deduction which would be made with respect to excess earnings under the provisions of sections 203 (b), (f), (g), <PRTPAGE P="576"/>(h), (j), and (l) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 403 (b), (f), (g), (h), (j), and (l)), as if such benefit payments were benefits payable under section 202 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402) (see §§ 404.428 through 404.456 of this title).</P>

                <P>Except as provided in § 725.212(b), beginning with the month in which a person other than a miner files a claim and becomes entitled to benefits, the benefits of other persons entitled to benefits with respect to the same miner, are adjusted downward, if necessary, so that no more than the permissible amount of benefits (the maximum amount for the number of beneficiaries involved) will be paid.</P>

                <P>(a) Ordinarily, a written request that the benefits of a miner or surviving spouse be augmented on account of a qualified dependent is made as part of the claim for benefits. However, it may also be made thereafter.</P>
                <P>(b) In the latter case, beginning with the month in which such a request is filed on account of a particular dependent and in which such dependent qualifies for augmentation purposes under this part, the augmented benefits attributable to other qualified dependents (with respect to the same miner or surviving spouse), if any, are adjusted downward, if necessary, so that the permissible amount of augmented benefits (the maximum amount for the number of dependents involved) will not be exceeded.</P>
                <P>(c) Where, based on the entitlement to benefits of a miner or surviving spouse, a dependent would have qualified for augmentation purposes for a prior month of such miner's or surviving spouse's entitlement had such request been filed in such prior month, such request is effective for such prior month. For any month before the month of filing such request, however, otherwise correct benefits previously certified by the Office may not be changed. Rather the amount of the augmented benefit attributable to the dependent filing such request in the later month is reduced for each month of the retroactive period to the extent that may be necessary. This means that for each month of the retroactive period, the amount payable to the dependent filing the later augmentation request is the difference, if any, between:</P>
                <P>(1) The total amount of augmented benefits certified for payment for other dependents for that month, and</P>
                <P>(2) The permissible amount of augmented benefits (the maximum amount for the number of dependents involved) payable for the month for all dependents, including the dependent filing later.</P>

The Office will also consider exemptions available to such individual under the pertinent State or Federal law in such proceedings.

Failure of the overpaid individual or his or her estate to make such payment as provided shall result in reinstatement of the full amount of the overpayment less any amounts paid prior to such default.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Enforcement generally.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Act, together with certain incorporated provisions from the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, contains a number of provisions which subject an operator or other employer, claimants and others to penalties for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Act, or failure to commence and continue prompt periodic payments to a beneficiary.</P>

              <P>(b) It is the policy and intent of the Department to vigorously enforce the provisions of this part through the use of the remedies provided by the Act. Accordingly, if an operator refuses to pay benefits with respect to a claim for which the operator has been adjudicated liable, the Director may invoke and execute the lien on the property of the operator as described in § 725.603. Enforcement of this lien must be pursued in an appropriate U.S. district court. If the Director determines that the remedy provided by § 725.603 may not be sufficient to guarantee the continued compliance with the terms of an award or awards against the operator, the Director may in addition seek an injunction in the U.S. district court to prohibit future noncompliance by the operator and such other relief as the court considers appropriate (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.604). If an operator unlawfully suspends or terminates the payment of benefits to a claimant, the district director may declare the award in default and proceed in accordance with § 725.605. In all cases payments of additional compensation (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.607) and interest (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.608) will be sought by the Director or awarded by the district director.</P>
              <P>(c) In certain instances the remedies provided by the Act are concurrent; that is, more than one remedy might be appropriate in any given case. In such a case, the Director may select the remedy or remedies appropriate for the enforcement action. In making this selection, the Director shall consider the best interests of the claimant as well as those of the fund.</P>

              <P>(a) In any case in which the fund has paid benefits, including medical benefits, on behalf of an operator or other employer which is determined liable therefore, or liable for a part thereof, such operator or other employer shall simultaneously with the first payment of benefits made to the beneficiary, reimburse the fund (with interest) for the full amount of all benefit payments made by the fund with respect to the claim.</P>
              <P>(b) In any case where benefit payments have been made by the fund, the fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary. The Secretary of Labor may, as appropriate, exercise such subrogation rights.</P>

              <P>(a) If an amount is paid out of the fund to an individual entitled to benefits under this part or part 727 of this subchapter (see § 725.4(d)) on behalf of an operator or other employer which is or was required to pay or secure the payment of all or a portion of such amount (see § 725.522), the operator or other employer shall be liable to the United States for repayment to the fund of the amount of benefits properly attributable to such operator or other employer.</P>
              <P>(b) If an operator or other employer liable to the fund refuses to pay, after demand, the amount of such liability, there shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such operator or other employer. The lien arises on the date on which such liability is finally determined, and continues until it is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the priority of the lien shall be determined in the same manner as under section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.).</P>

              <P>(2) In the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the lien imposed under this section shall be treated in the same manner as a lien for taxes due and owing to the United States for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act or section <PRTPAGE P="581"/>3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 191).</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) to determine the priority between the lien imposed under this section and the Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of the section, notice of the lien imposed hereunder shall be filed in the same manner as under section 6323(f) (disregarding paragraph (4) thereof) and (g) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.).</P>
              <P>(5) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay the liability imposed under this section, the Secretary of Labor may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the United States under this section with respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the operator, or in which it has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such liability.</P>
              <P>(6) The liability imposed by this paragraph may be collected at a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date upon which the liability was finally determined, or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the operator and the United States before the expiration of such 6-year period. This period of limitation shall be suspended for any period during which the assets of the operator are in the custody or control of any court of the United States, or of any State, or the District of Columbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any period during which the operator is outside the United States if such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6 months.</P>

              <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of § 725.603, if an operator or other employer or its officers or agents fails to comply with an order awarding benefits that has become final, any beneficiary of such award or the district director may apply for the enforcement of the order to the Federal district court for the judicial district in which the injury occurred (or to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia if the injury occurred in the District). If the court determines that the order was made and served in accordance with law, and that such operator or other employer or its officers or agents have failed to comply therewith, the court shall enforce obedience to the order by writ of injunction or by other proper process, mandatory or otherwise, to enjoin upon such operator or other employer and its officers or agents compliance with the order.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Defaults.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as is otherwise provided in this part, no suspension, termination or other failure to pay benefits awarded to a claimant is permitted. If an employer found liable for the payment of such benefits fails to make such payments within 30 days after any date on which such benefits are due and payable, the person to whom such benefits are payable may, within one year after such default, make application to the district director for a supplementary order declaring the amount of the default.</P>

              <P>(b) If after investigation, notice and hearing as provided in subparts E and F of this part, a default is found, the district director or the administrative law judge, if a hearing is requested, shall issue a supplementary order declaring the amount of the default, if any. In cases where a lump-sum award has been made, if the payment in default is an installment, the district director or administrative law judge, may, in his or her discretion, declare the whole of the award as the amount in default. The applicant may file a certified copy of such supplementary order with the clerk of the Federal district court for the judicial district in which the operator has its principal place of business or maintains an office or for the judicial district in which the injury occurred. In case such principal place of business or office is in the District of Columbia, a copy of such supplementary order may be filed with the clerk of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Such supplementary order shall be final and the court shall, upon the filing of the copy, <PRTPAGE P="582"/>enter judgment for the amount declared in default by the supplementary order if such supplementary order is in accordance with law. Review of the judgment may be had as in civil suits for damages at common law. Final proceedings to execute the judgment may be had by writ of execution in the form used by the court in suits at common law in actions of assumpsit. No fee shall be required for filing the supplementary order nor for entry of judgment thereon, and the applicant shall not be liable for costs in a proceeding for review of the judgment unless the court shall otherwise direct. The court shall modify such judgment to conform to any later benefits order upon presentation of a certified copy thereof to the court.</P>
              <P>(c) In cases where judgment cannot be satisfied by reason of the employer's insolvency or other circumstances precluding payment, the district director shall make payment from the fund, and in addition, provide any necessary medical, surgical, and other treatment required by subpart J of this part. A defaulting employer shall be liable to the fund for payment of the amounts paid by the fund under this section; and for the purpose of enforcing this liability, the fund shall be subrogated to all the rights of the person receiving such payments or benefits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Security for the payment of benefits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Following the issuance of an effective order by a district director (see § 725.418), administrative law judge (see § 725.479), Benefits Review Board, or court that requires the payment of benefits by an operator that has failed to secure the payment of benefits in accordance with section 423 of the Act and § 726.4 of this subchapter, or by a coal mine construction or transportation employer, the Director may request that the operator secure the payment of all benefits ultimately payable on the claim. Such operator or other employer shall thereafter immediately secure the payment of benefits in accordance with the provisions of this section, and provide proof of such security to the Director. Such security may take the form of an indemnity bond, a deposit of cash or negotiable securities in compliance with §§ 726.106(c) and 726.107 of this subchapter, or any other form acceptable to the Director.</P>
              <P>(b) The amount of security initially required by this section shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) In a case involving an operator subject to section 423 of the Act and § 726.4 of this subchapter, the amount of the security shall not be less than $175,000, and may be a higher amount as determined by the Director, taking into account the life expectancies of the claimant and any dependents using the most recent life expectancy tables published by the Social Security Administration; or</P>
              <P>(2) In a case involving a coal mine construction or transportation employer, the amount of the security shall be determined by the Director, taking into account the life expectancies of the claimant and any dependents using the most recent life expectancy tables published by the Social Security Administration.</P>

              <P>(c) If the operator or other employer fails to provide proof of such security to the Director within 30 days of its receipt of the Director's request to secure the payment of benefits issued under paragraph (a) of this section, the appropriate adjudication officer shall issue an order requiring the operator or other employer to make a deposit of negotiable securities with a Federal Reserve Bank in the amount required by paragraph (b). Such securities shall comply with the requirements of §§ 726.106(c) and 726.107 of this subchapter. In a case in which the effective order was issued by a district director, the district director shall be considered the appropriate adjudication officer. In any other case, the administrative law judge who issued the most recent decision in the case, or such other administrative law judge as the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall designate, shall be considered the appropriate adjudication officer, and shall issue an order under this paragraph on motion of the Director. The administrative law judge shall have jurisdiction to issue an order under this paragraph notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal of the award of benefits with the Benefits Review Board or court.<PRTPAGE P="583"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) An order issued under this section shall be considered effective when issued. Disputes regarding such orders shall be resolved in accordance with subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Notwithstanding any further review of the order in accordance with subpart F of this part, if an operator or other employer subject to an order issued under this section fails to comply with such order, the appropriate adjudication officer shall certify such non-compliance to the appropriate United States district court in accordance with § 725.351(c).</P>
              <P>(f) Security posted in accordance with this section may be used to make payment of benefits that become due with respect to the claim in accordance with § 725.502. In the event that either the order awarding compensation or the order issued under this section is vacated or reversed, the operator or other employer may apply to the appropriate adjudication officer for an order authorizing the return of any amounts deposited with a Federal Reserve Bank and not yet disbursed, and such application shall be granted. If at any time the Director determines that additional security is required beyond that initially required by paragraph (b) of this section, he may request the operator or other employer to increase the amount. Such request shall be treated as if it were issued under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) If a coal mine construction or transportation employer fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (c), and such employer is a corporation, the provisions of § 725.609 shall be applicable to the president, secretary, and treasurer of such employer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payments of additional compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If any benefits payable under the terms of an award by a district director (§ 725.419(d)), a decision and order filed and served by an administrative law judge (§ 725.478), or a decision filed by the Board or a U.S. court of appeals, are not paid by an operator or other employer ordered to make such payments within 10 days after such payments become due, there will be added to such unpaid benefits an amount equal to 20 percent thereof, which must be paid to the claimant at the same time as, but in addition to, such benefits, unless review of the order making such award is sought as provided in section 21 of the LHWCA and an order staying payments has been issued.</P>
              <P>(b) If, on account of an operator's or other employer's failure to pay benefits as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, benefit payments are made by the fund, the eligible claimant will nevertheless be entitled to receive such additional compensation to which he or she may be eligible under paragraph (a), with respect to all amounts paid by the fund on behalf of such operator or other employer.</P>
              <P>(c) The fund may not be held liable for payments of additional compensation under any circumstances.</P>

The first determination that such an award should be made may be a district director's initial determination of entitlement, an award made by an administrative law judge or a decision by the Board or a court, whichever is the first such determination of entitlement made upon the claim.</P>

              <P>(3) In any case in which an operator is liable for the payment of additional compensation (§ 725.607), the beneficiary shall also be entitled to simple annual interest computed from the date upon which the beneficiary's right to additional compensation first arose.<PRTPAGE P="584"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) In any case in which an operator is liable for the payment of medical benefits, the beneficiary or medical provider to whom such benefits are owed shall also be entitled to simple annual interest, computed from the date upon which the services were rendered, or from 30 days after the date of the first determination that the miner is generally entitled to medical benefits, whichever is later. The first determination that the miner is generally entitled to medical benefits may be a district director's initial determination of entitlement, an award made by an administrative law judge or a decision by the Board or a court, whichever is the first such determination of general entitlement made upon the claim. The interest shall be computed through the date on which the operator paid the benefits, except that the beneficiary or medical provider shall not be entitled to interest for any period following the date on which the beneficiary or medical provider received payment of any benefits from the fund pursuant to § 725.522 or subpart I of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) If an operator or other employer fails or refuses to pay any or all benefits due pursuant to an award of benefits or an initial determination of eligibility made by the district director and the fund undertakes such payments, such operator or other employer shall be liable to the fund for simple annual interest on all payments made by the fund for which such operator is determined liable, computed from the first date on which such benefits are paid by the fund, in addition to such operator's liability to the fund, as is otherwise provided in this part. Interest payments owed pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid directly to the fund.</P>
              <P>(c) In any case in which an operator is liable for the payment of an attorney's fee pursuant to § 725.367, and the attorney's fee is payable because the award of benefits has become final, the attorney shall also be entitled to simple annual interest, computed from the date on which the attorney's fee was awarded. The interest shall be computed through the date on which the operator paid the attorney's fee.</P>
              <P>(d) The rates of interest applicable to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For all amounts outstanding prior to January 1, 1982, the rate shall be 6% simple annual interest;</P>
              <P>(2) For all amounts outstanding for any period during calendar year 1982, the rate shall be 15% simple annual interest; and</P>
              <P>(3) For all amounts outstanding during any period after calendar year 1982, the rate shall be simple annual interest at the rate established by section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) which is in effect for such period.</P>
              <P>(e) The fund shall not be liable for the payment of interest under any circumstances, other than the payment of interest on advances from the United States Treasury as provided by section 9501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What medical benefits are available?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A miner who is determined to be eligible for benefits under this part or part 727 of this subchapter (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.4(d)) is entitled to medical benefits as set forth in this subpart as of the date of his or her claim, but in no event before January 1, 1974. Medical benefits may not be provided to the survivor or dependent of a miner under this part.</P>
              <P>(b) A responsible operator, or where there is none, the fund, must furnish a miner entitled to benefits under this part with such medical services and treatments (including professional medical services and medical equipment, prescription drugs, outpatient medical services, inpatient medical services, and any other medical service, treatment or supply) for such periods as the nature of the miner's pneumoconiosis and disability requires.</P>
              <P>(c) The medical benefits referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section include palliative measures useful only to prevent pain or discomfort associated with the miner's pneumoconiosis or attendant disability.</P>
              <P>(d) An operator or the fund must also pay the miner's reasonable cost of travel necessary for medical treatment (to be determined in accordance with prevailing United States government mileage rates) and the reasonable documented cost to the miner or medical provider incurred in communicating with the operator, carrier, or OWCP on matters connected with medical benefits.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If a miner receives a medical service or treatment, as described in this section, for any pulmonary disorder, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the disorder is caused or aggravated by the miner's pneumoconiosis.</P>
              <P>(2) The party liable for the payment of benefits may rebut the presumption by producing credible evidence that the medical service or treatment provided was for a pulmonary disorder apart from those previously associated with the miner's disability, or was beyond that necessary to effectively treat a covered disorder, or was not for a pulmonary disorder at all.</P>
              <P>(3) An operator or the fund, however, cannot rely on evidence that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis or is not totally disabled by pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment to defeat a request for coverage of any medical service or treatment under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) In determining whether the treatment is compensable, the opinion of the miner's treating physician may be entitled to controlling weight pursuant to § 718.104(d) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(5) A finding that a medical service or treatment is not covered under this subpart will not otherwise affect the miner's entitlement to benefits.</P>

              <P>The term “physician” includes only doctors of medicine (MD) and doctors of osteopathy (DO) within the scope of their practices as defined by State law. No treatment or medical services performed by any other practitioner of the healing arts is authorized by this part, unless such treatment or service is authorized and supervised both by a physician as defined in this section and by OWCP.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How is treatment authorized?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon notification to a miner of such miner's entitlement to benefits, OWCP must provide the miner with a list of authorized treating physicians and medical facilities in the area of the miner's residence. The miner may select a physician from this list or may select another physician with approval of OWCP. Where emergency services are necessary and appropriate, authorization by OWCP is not required.</P>

              <P>(b) OWCP may, on its own initiative, or at the request of a responsible operator, order a change of physicians or facilities, but only where it has been determined that the change is desirable or necessary in the best interest of the miner. The miner may change physicians or facilities subject to the approval of OWCP.<PRTPAGE P="587"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) If adequate treatment cannot be obtained in the area of the claimant's residence, OWCP may authorize the use of physicians or medical facilities outside such area as well as reimbursement for travel expenses and overnight accommodations.</P>

              <P>(1) Notify the miner and the providers chosen that the operator or carrier will be responsible for the cost of medical services provided to the miner on account of the miner's total disability due to pneumoconiosis;</P>
              <P>(2) Designate a person or persons with decision-making authority with whom OWCP, the miner and authorized providers may communicate on matters involving medical benefits provided under this subpart and notify OWCP, the miner and providers of this designation;</P>
              <P>(3) Make arrangements for the direct reimbursement of providers for their services.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fund liability.</E> If there is no operator found liable for the payment of benefits, OWCP will make necessary arrangements to provide medical care to the miner, notify the miner and providers selected of the liability of the fund, designate a person or persons with whom the miner or provider may communicate on matters relating to medical care, and make arrangements for the direct reimbursement of the medical provider.</P>

              <P>(b) Except where emergency treatment is required, prior approval of OWCP or the responsible operator must be obtained before any hospitalization or surgery, or before ordering medical equipment where the purchase price exceeds $300. A request for approval of non-emergency hospitalization or surgery must be acted upon expeditiously, and approval or disapproval will be given by telephone if a written response cannot be given within 7 days following the request. No employee of the Department of Labor, other than a district director or the Chief, Medical Audit and Operations Section, DCMWC, is authorized to approve a request for hospitalization or surgery by telephone.</P>

              <P>(b) In order to permit continuing supervision of the medical care provided to the miner with respect to the necessity, character and sufficiency of any medical care furnished or to be furnished, the provider, operator or carrier must submit such reports in addition to those required by paragraph (a) of this section as OWCP may from time to time require.

              <P>(b) When medical benefits are paid by the fund at OWCP's direction, either on an interim basis or because there is no liable operator, the prevailing community rate for various types of service will be determined as provided in §§ 725.708-725.711.<PRTPAGE P="588"/>

              <P>(e) OWCP must review the payment formulas described in §§ 725.708-725.711 at least once a year, and may adjust, revise or replace any payment formula or its components when necessary or appropriate to ensure miners' access to care or for other reasons.</P>
              <P>(f) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the provisions of §§ 725.707-725.711 apply to all medical services and treatments rendered after August 31, 2018.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How are payments for professional medical services and medical equipment determined?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) OWCP pays for professional medical services based on a fee schedule derived from the schedule maintained by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for the payment of such services under the Medicare program (42 CFR part 414). The schedule OWCP utilizes consists of: An assignment of Relative Value Units (RVU) to procedures identified by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System/Current Procedural Terminology (HCPCS/CPT) code, which represents the work (relative time and intensity of the service), the practice expense and the malpractice expense, as compared to other procedures of the same general class; an assignment of Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) values, which represent the relative work, practice expense and malpractice expense relative to other localities throughout the country; and a monetary value assignment (conversion factor) for one unit of value for each coded service.</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum payment for professional medical services identified by a HCPCS/CPT code is calculated by multiplying the RVU values for the service by the GPCI values for such service in that area and multiplying the sum of these values by the conversion factor to arrive at a dollar amount assigned to one unit in that category of service.</P>
              <P>(3) OWCP utilizes the RVUs published, and updated or revised from time to time, by CMS for all services for which CMS has made assignments. Where there are no RVUs assigned, OWCP may develop and assign any RVUs that OWCP considers appropriate. OWCP utilizes the GPCI for the locality as defined by CMS and as updated or revised by CMS from time to time. OWCP will devise conversion factors for professional medical services using OWCP's processing experience and internal data.</P>
              <P>(b) Where a professional medical service is not covered by the fee schedule described in paragraph (a) of this section, OWCP may pay for the service based on other fee schedules or pricing formulas utilized by OWCP for professional medical services.</P>
              <P>(c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to professional medical services rendered after April 26, 2020.</P>
              <P>(d) OWCP pays for medical equipment identified by a HCPCS/CPT code based on fee schedules or other pricing formulas utilized by OWCP for such equipment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How are payments for prescription drugs determined?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) OWCP pays for drugs prescribed by physicians by multiplying a percentage of the average wholesale price, or other baseline price as specified by OWCP, of the medication by the quantity or amount provided, plus a dispensing fee.</P>

              <P>(2) All prescription medications identified by National Drug Code are assigned an average wholesale price representing the product's nationally recognized wholesale price as determined by surveys of manufacturers and wholesalers, or another baseline price designated by OWCP.<PRTPAGE P="589"/>

              <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, OWCP pays for outpatient medical services according to Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APCs) derived from the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) devised by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for the Medicare program (42 CFR part 419).</P>
              <P>(2) For outpatient medical services paid under the OPPS, such services are assigned according to the APC prescribed by CMS for that service. Each payment is derived by multiplying the prospectively established scaled relative weight for the service's clinical APC by a conversion factor to arrive at a national unadjusted payment rate for the APC. The labor portion of the national unadjusted payment rate is further adjusted by the hospital wage index for the area where payment is being made. Additional adjustments are also made as required or needed.</P>
              <P>(b) If a compensable service cannot be assigned or paid at the prevailing community rate under the OPPS or occurs at a facility excluded from the Medicare OPPS, OWCP may pay for the service based on fee schedules or other pricing formulas utilized by OWCP for outpatient services.</P>
              <P>(c) This section does not apply to services provided by ambulatory surgical centers.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) OWCP pays for inpatient medical services according to predetermined rates derived from the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) used by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for the Medicare program (42 CFR part 412).</P>
              <P>(2) Inpatient hospital discharges are classified into diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Each DRG groups together clinically similar conditions that require comparable amounts of inpatient resources. For each DRG, an appropriate weighting factor is assigned that reflects the estimated relative cost of hospital resources used with respect to discharges classified within that group compared to discharges classified within other groups.</P>
              <P>(3) For each hospital discharge classified within a DRG, a payment amount for that discharge is determined by using the national weighting factor determined for that DRG, national standardized adjustments, and other factors which may vary by hospital, such as an adjustment for area wage levels. OWCP may also use other price adjustment factors as appropriate based on its processing experience and internal data.</P>
              <P>(b) If an inpatient service cannot be classified by DRG, occurs at a facility excluded from the Medicare IPPS, or otherwise cannot be paid at the prevailing community rate under the pricing formula described in paragraph (a) of this section, OWCP may pay for the service based on fee schedules or other pricing formulas utilized by OWCP for inpatient services.</P>

              <P>(a) A provider must itemize charges on Form OWCP-1500 or CMS-1500 (for professional services, equipment or drugs dispensed in the office), Form OWCP-04 or UB-04 (for hospitals), an electronic or paper-based bill that includes required data elements (for pharmacies) or other form as designated by OWCP, and submit the form promptly to OWCP.</P>
              <P>(b) The provider must identify each medical service performed using the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, the National Drug Code (NDC) number, or the Revenue Center Code (RCC), as appropriate to the type of service. OWCP has discretion to determine which of these codes may be utilized in the billing process. OWCP also has the authority to create and supply codes for specific services or treatments. These OWCP-created codes will be issued to providers by OWCP as appropriate and may only be used as authorized by OWCP.

              <P>(c)(1) By submitting a bill or accepting payment, the provider signifies that the service for which reimbursement is sought was performed as described, necessary, appropriate, and properly billed in accordance with accepted industry standards. For example, accepted industry standards preclude upcoding billed services for extended medical appointments when the miner actually had a brief routine appointment, or charging for the services of a professional when a paraprofessional or aide performed the service; industry standards prohibit unbundling services to charge separately for services that should be billed as a single charge.</P>
              <P>(2) The provider agrees to comply with all regulations set forth in this subpart concerning the provision of medical services or treatments and/or the process for seeking reimbursement for medical services and treatments, including the limitation imposed on the amount to be paid.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 725.716</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How should a miner prepare and submit requests for reimbursement for covered medical expenses and transportation costs?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a miner has paid bills for a medical service or treatment covered under § 725.701 and seeks reimbursement for those expenses, he or she may submit a request for reimbursement on Form OWCP-915, together with an itemized bill. The reimbursement request must be accompanied by evidence that the provider received payment for the service from the miner and a statement of the amount paid. Acceptable evidence that payment was received includes, but is not limited to, a copy of the miner's canceled check (both front and back) or a copy of the miner's credit card receipt.</P>
              <P>(b) OWCP may waive the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if extensive delays in the filing or the adjudication of a claim make it unusually difficult for the miner to obtain the required information.</P>
              <P>(c) Reimbursements for covered medical services paid by a miner generally will be no greater than the maximum allowable charge for such service as determined under §§ 725.707-725.711.</P>
              <P>(d) A miner will be only partially reimbursed for a covered medical service if the amount he or she paid to a provider for the service exceeds the maximum charge allowable. If this happens, OWCP will advise the miner of the maximum allowable charge for the service in question and of his or her responsibility to ask the provider to refund to the miner, or credit to the miner's account, the amount he or she paid which exceeds the maximum allowable charge.</P>
              <P>(e) If the provider does not refund to the miner or credit to his or her account the amount of money paid in excess of the charge allowed by OWCP, the miner should submit documentation to OWCP of the attempt to obtain such refund or credit. OWCP may make reasonable reimbursement to the miner after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case.</P>
              <P>(f) If a miner has paid transportation costs or other incidental expenses related to covered medical services under this part, the miner may submit a request for reimbursement on Form OWCP-957 or OWCP-915, together with proof of payment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the time limitations for requesting payment or reimbursement for covered medical services or treatments?</SUBJECT>

              <P>OWCP will pay providers and reimburse miners promptly for all bills received on an approved form and in a timely manner. However, absent good cause, no bill will be paid for expenses incurred if the bill is submitted more than one year beyond the end of the calendar year in which the expense was incurred or the service or supply was provided, or more than one year beyond the end of the calendar year in which the miner's eligibility for benefits is finally adjudicated, whichever is <PRTPAGE P="592"/>later. A provider may not request reimbursement from a miner for a bill denied by OWCP due to late submission of the bill by the provider.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 725.718</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How are disputes concerning medical benefits resolved?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a dispute develops concerning medical services or treatments or their payment under this part, OWCP must attempt to informally resolve the dispute. OWCP may, on its own initiative or at the request of the responsible operator or its insurance carrier, order the claimant to submit to an examination by a physician selected by OWCP.</P>

              <P>(b) If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, OWCP will refer the case to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for a hearing in accordance with this part. Any such hearing concerning authorization of medical services or treatments must be scheduled at the earliest possible time and must take precedence over all other hearing requests except for other requests under this section and as provided by § 727.405 of this subchapter (<E T="03">see</E> § 725.4(d)). During the pendency of such adjudication, OWCP may order the payment of medical benefits prior to final adjudication under the same conditions applicable to benefits awarded under § 725.522.</P>
              <P>(c) In the development or adjudication of a dispute over medical benefits, the adjudication officer is authorized to take whatever action may be necessary to protect the health of a totally disabled miner.</P>
              <P>(d) Any interested medical provider may, if appropriate, be made a party to a dispute under this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the objective of vocational rehabilitation?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The objective of vocational rehabilitation is the return of a miner who is totally disabled by pneumoconiosis to gainful employment commensurate with such miner's physical impairment. This objective may be achieved through a program of re-evaluation and redirection of the miner's abilities, or retraining in another occupation, and selective job placement assistance.</P>

              <P>Each miner who has been determined entitled to receive benefits under part C of title IV of the Act must be informed by OWCP of the availability and advisability of vocational rehabilitation services. If such miner chooses to avail himself or herself of vocational rehabilitation, his or her request will be processed and referred by OWCP vocational rehabilitation advisors pursuant to the provisions of §§ 702.501 through 702.508 of this chapter as is appropriate.</P>

              <P>Section 423 of title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act as amended (hereinafter the Act) requires each coal mine operator who is operating or has operated a coal mine in a State which is not included in the list published by the Secretary (see part 722 of this subchapter) to secure the payment of benefits for which he may be found liable under section 422 of the Act and the provisions of this subchapter by either:</P>

              <P>(b) This Subpart A sets forth the scope and purpose of this part and generally describes the statutory framework within which this part is operative.</P>

              <P>(a) This part 726 implements and effectuates responsibilities for the payment of black lung benefits placed upon coal mine operators by sections <PRTPAGE P="594"/>415 and 422 of the Act and the regulations of the Secretary in this subchapter, particularly those set forth in part 725 of this subchapter. All definitions, usages, procedures, and other rules affecting the responsibilities of coal mine operators prescribed in part 725 of this subchapter are hereby made applicable, as appropriate, to this part 726.</P>
              <P>(b) If the provisions of this part appear to conflict with any provision of any other part in this subchapter, the apparently conflicting provisions should be read harmoniously to the fullest extent possible. If a harmonious interpretation is not possible, the provisions of this part should be applied to govern the responsibilities and obligations of coal mine operators to secure the payment of black lung benefits as prescribed by the Act. The provisions of this part do not apply to matters falling outside the scope of this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 726.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Who must obtain insurance coverage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Section 423 of part C of title IV of the Act requires each operator of a coal mine or former operator in any State which does meet the requirements prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 411 of part C of title IV of the Act to self-insure or obtain a policy or contract of insurance to guarantee the payment of benefits for which such operator may be adjudicated liable under section 422 of the Act. In enacting sections 422 and 423 of the Act Congress has unambiguously expressed its intent that coal mine operators bear the cost of providing the benefits established by part C of title IV of the Act. Section 3 of the Act defines an “operator” as any owner, lessee, or other person who operates, controls, or supervises a coal mine.</P>
              <P>(b) Section 422(i) of the Act clearly recognizes that any individual or business entity who is or was a coal mine operator may be found liable for the payment of pneumoconiosis benefits after December 31, 1973. Within this framework it is clear that the Secretary has wide latitude for determining which operator shall be liable for the payment of part C benefits. Comprehensive standards have been promulgated in subpart G of part 725 of this subchapter for the purpose of guiding the Secretary in making such determination. It must be noted that pursuant to these standards any parent or subsidiary corporation, any individual or corporate partner, or partnership, any lessee or lessor of a coal mine, any joint venture or participant in a joint venture, any transferee or transferor of a corporation or other business entity, any former, current, or future operator or any other form of business entity which has had or will have a substantial and reasonably direct interest in the operation of a coal mine may be determined liable for the payment of pneumoconiosis benefits after December 31, 1973. The failure of any such business entity to self-insure or obtain a policy or contract of insurance shall in no way relieve such business entity of its obligation to pay pneumoconiosis benefits in respect of any case in which such business entity's responsibility for such payments has been properly adjudicated. Any business entity described in this section shall take appropriate steps to insure that any liability imposed by part C of the Act on such business entity shall be dischargeable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Effective date of insurance coverage.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Pursuant to section 422(c) of part C of title IV of the Act, no coal mine operator shall be responsible for the payment of any benefits whatsoever for any period prior to January 1, 1974. However, coal mine operators shall be liable as of January 1, 1974, for the payment of benefits in respect of claims which were filed under section 415 of part B of title IV of the Act after July 1, 1973. Section 415(a)(3) requires the Secretary to notify any operator who may be liable for the payment of benefits under part C of title IV beginning on January 1, 1974, of the pendency of a section 415 claim. Section 415(a)(5) declares that any operator who has been notified of the pendency of a section 415 claim shall be bound by the determination of the Secretary as to such operator's liability and as to the claimant's entitlement to benefits as if the claim were filed under part C of title IV of the Act and section 422 thereof had been applicable to such operator. <PRTPAGE P="595"/>Therefore, even though no benefit payments shall be required of an operator prior to January 1, 1974, the liability for these payments may be finally adjudicated at any time after July 1, 1973. Neither the failure of an operator to exercise his right to participate in the adjudication of such a claim nor the failure of an operator to obtain insurance coverage in respect of claims filed after June 30, 1973, but before January 1, 1974, shall excuse such operator from his liability for the payment of benefits to such claimants under part C of title IV of the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) Upon receipt of a completed application for authorization to self-insure, the Office shall, after examination of the information contained in the application, either deny the request or determine the amount of security which must be given by the applicant to guarantee the payment of benefits and the discharge of all other obligations which may be required of such applicant under the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) The applicant shall thereafter be notified that he may give security in the amount fixed by the Office (see § 726.105):</P>

A request for review should contain such information as may be necessary to support the request that the amount of security required be reduced.</P>

In each case in which the surety on any such bond is a surety company, such company must be one approved by the U.S. Treasury Department under the laws of the United States and the applicable rules and regulations governing bonding companies (see Department of Treasury's Circular—570).</P>

The Office may reduce the amount of security at any time on its own initiative, or upon the application of a self-insurer, when it believes the facts warrant a reduction. A self-insurer seeking a reduction shall furnish such information as the Office may request relative to his current affairs, the nature and hazard of the work of his employees, the amount of the payroll of his employees engaged in coal mine employment within the purview of the Act, his financial condition, and such other evidence as may be deemed material, including a record of benefit payments he has made.</P>

              <P>(a) No initial authorization to self-insure shall be granted for a period in excess of 18 months. A self-insurer who has made an adequate deposit of negotiable securities in compliance with §§ 726.106(c) and 726.107 will be reauthorized for the ensuing fiscal year without additional security if the Office finds that his experience as a self-insurer warrants such action. If the Office determines that such self-insurer's experience indicates a need for the deposit of additional security, no reauthorization shall be issued for the ensuing fiscal year until the Office receives satisfactory proof that the requisite amount of additional securities has been deposited. A self-insurer who currently has on file an indemnity bond will receive from the Office each year a bond form for execution in contemplation of reauthorization, and the submission of such bond duly executed in the amount indicated by the Office will be deemed and treated as such self-insurer's application for reauthorization for the ensuing fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(b) In each case for which there is an approved change in the amount of security provided, a new agreement and undertaking shall be executed.</P>

              <P>(c) Each operator authorized to self-insure under this part shall apply for reauthorization for any period during which it engages in the operation of a coal mine and for additional periods after it ceases operating a coal mine. Upon application by the operator, accompanied by proof that the security it has posted is sufficient to secure all benefits potentially payable to miners <PRTPAGE P="600"/>formerly employed by the operator, the Office shall issue a certification that the operator is exempt from the requirements of this part based on its prior operation of a coal mine. The provisions of subpart D of this part shall be applicable to any operator that fails to apply for reauthorization in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>

Failure by a self-insurer to comply with any provision or requirement of law or of the regulations in this part, or with any lawful order or communication of the Office, or the failure or insolvency of the surety on his indemnity bond, or impairment of financial responsibility of such self-insurer, may be deemed good cause for such suspension or revocation.</P>

                <P>It is agreed that: (1) With respect to operations in a State designated in item 3 of the declarations, the unqualified term “workmen's compensation law” includes part C of title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. section 931-936, and any laws amendatory thereto, or supplementary thereto, which may be or become effective while this policy is in force, and definition (a) of Insuring Agreement III is amended accordingly; (2) with respect to such insurance as is afforded by this endorsement, (a) the States, if any, named below, shall be deemed to be designated in item 3 of the declaration; (b) Insuring Agreement IV(2) is amended to read “by disease caused or aggravated by exposure of which the last day of the last exposure, in the employment of the insured, to conditions causing the disease occurs during the policy period, or occurred prior to (effective date) and claim based on such disease is first filed against the insured during the policy period.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(b) The term “effective date” as used in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to mean the effective date of the first policy or contract of insurance procured by an operator for purposes of meeting the obligations imposed on such operator by section 423 of part C of title IV of the Act.</P>

              <P>(c) The Act contains a number of provisions and imposes a number of requirements on operators which differ in varying degrees from traditional workmen's compensation concepts. To avoid unnecessary administrative delays and expense which might be occasioned by the drafting of an entirely new standard workmen's compensation policy specially tailored to the Act, the Office has determined that the existing standard workmen's compensation policy subject to the endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall be acceptable for purposes of writing commercial insurance coverage <PRTPAGE P="601"/>under the Act. However, to avoid undue disputes over the meaning of certain policy provisions and in accordance with the authority contained in section 423(b)(3) of the Act, the Office has determined that the following requirements shall be applicable to all commercial insurance policies obtained by an operator for the purpose of insuring any liability incurred pursuant to the Act:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Operator liability.</E> (i) Section 415 and part C of title IV of the Act provide coverage for total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis to all claimants who meet the eligibility requirements imposed by the Act. Section 422 of the Act and the regulations duly promulgated thereunder (part 725 of this subchapter) set forth the conditions under which a coal mine operator may be adjudicated liable for the payment of benefits to an eligible claimant for any period subsequent to December 31, 1973.</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 422(c) of the Act prescribes that except as provided in 422(i) (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) an operator may be adjudicated liable for the payment of benefits in any case if the total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis upon which the claim is predicated arose at least in part out of employment in a mine in any period during which it was operated by such operator. The Act does not require that such employment which contributed to or caused the total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis occur subsequent to any particular date in time. The Secretary in establishing a formula for determining the operator liable for the payment of benefits (see subpart D of part 725 of this subchapter) in respect of any particular claim, must therefore, within the framework and intent of title IV of the Act find in appropriate cases that an operator is liable for the payment of benefits for some period after December 31, 1973, even though the employment upon which an operator's liability is based occurred prior to July 1, 1973, or prior to the effective date of the Act or the effective date of any amendments thereto, or prior to the effective date of any policy or contract of insurance obtained by such operator. The endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to incorporate these requirements in any policy or contract of insurance obtained by an operator to meet the obligations imposed on such operator by section 423 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Successor liability.</E> Section 422(i) of part C of title IV of the Act requires that a coal mine operator who after December 30, 1969, acquired his mine or substantially all of the assets thereof from a person who was an operator of such mine on or after December 30, 1969, shall be liable for and shall secure the payment of benefits which would have been payable by the prior operator with respect to miners previously employed in such mine if the acquisition had not occurred and the prior operator had continued to operate such mine. In the case of an operator who is determined liable for the payment of benefits under section 422(i) of the Act and part 725 of this subchapter, such liability shall accrue to such operator regardless of the fact that the miner on whose total disability or death the claim is predicated was never employed by such operator in any capacity. The endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to incorporate this requirement in any policy or contract of insurance obtained by an operator to meet the obligations imposed on such operator by section 423 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Medical eligibility.</E> Pursuant to section 422(h) of part C of title IV of the Act and the regulations described therein (see subpart D of part 410 of this title) benefits shall be paid to eligible claimants on account of total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis and in cases where the miner on whose death a claim is predicated was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of his death regardless of the cause of such death. The endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to incorporate these requirements in any policy or contract of insurance obtained by an operator to meet the obligations imposed on such operator by section 423 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment of benefits, rates.</E> Section 422(c) of the Act by incorporating section 412(a) of the Act requires the payment of benefits at a rate equal to 50 <PRTPAGE P="602"/>per centum of the minimum monthly payment to which a Federal employee in grade GS-2, who is totally disabled is entitled at the time of payment under Chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code. These benefits are augmented on account of eligible dependents as appropriate (see section 412(a) of part B of title IV of the Act). Since the dollar amount of benefits payable to any beneficiary is required to be computed at the time of payment such amounts may be expected to increase from time to time as changes in the GS-2 grade are enacted into law. The endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to incorporate in any policy or contract of insurance obtained by an operator to meet the obligations imposed on such operator by section 423 of the Act, the requirement that the payment of benefits to eligible beneficiaries shall be made in such dollar amounts as are prescribed by section 412(a) of the Act computed at the time of payment.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Compromise and waiver of benefits.</E> Section 422(a) of part C of title IV of the Act by incorporating sections 15(b) and 16 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 915(b) and 916) prohibits the compromise and/or waiver of claims for benefits filed or benefits payable under section 415 and part C of title IV of the Act. The endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to incorporate these prohibitions in any policy or contract of insurance obtained by an operator to meet the obligations imposed on such operator by section 423 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Additional requirements.</E> In addition to the requirements described in paragraph (c)(1) through (5) of this section, the endorsement provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall, to the fullest extent possible, be construed to bring any policy or contract of insurance entered into by an operator for the purpose of insuring such operator's liability under part C of title IV of the Act into conformity with the legal requirements placed upon such operator by section 415 and part C of title IV of the Act and parts 720 and 725 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(d) Nothing in this section shall relieve any operator or carrier of the duty to comply with any State workmen's compensation law, except insofar as such State law is in conflict with the provisions of this section.</P>

In any event, the failure of an operator to obtain an adequate policy or contract of insurance shall not affect such operator's liability for the payment of any benefits for which he is determined liable.</P>

Notice to or knowledge of an operator of the occurrence of total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis shall be notice to or knowledge of such carrier. Jurisdiction of the operator by a district director, administrative law judge, the Office, or appropriate appellate authority under the Act shall be jurisdiction of such carrier.

              <P>Any operator which is required to secure the payment of benefits under section 423 of the Act and § 726.4 and which fails to secure such benefits, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended, for each day during which such failure occurs. If the operator is a corporation, the president, secretary, and treasurer of the operator shall also be severally liable for the penalty based on the operator's failure to secure the payment of benefits.

The period during which an operator is subject to liability for a penalty for failure to secure its obligations shall be deemed to commence on the first day on which the operator met the definition of the term “operator” as set forth in § 725.101 of this subchapter. The period shall be deemed to continue even where the operator has ceased coal mining and any related activity, unless the operator secured its liability for all previous periods through a policy or policies of insurance obtained in accordance with subpart C of this part or has obtained a certification of exemption in accordance with the provisions of § 726.114.</P>

No stay shall be issued unless irreparable injury would otherwise ensue to the employer, coal mine operator or insurance carrier. Any order of the Board permitting any stay shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the Board and identified by reference thereto, that irreparable injury would result to such employer, operator or insurance carrier, and specify the nature and extent of the injury.</P>
              <P>(b) When circumstances require, the Board, in its discretion, may issue a temporary order not to exceed 30 days granting a motion for stay of payment prior to the expiration of the ten-day period allowed for filing responses to motions pursuant to § 802.219(e).

              <SUBJECT>Who may file an appeal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">A party.</E> (1) Any party or party-in-interest adversely affected or aggrieved by a decision or order issued pursuant to one of the Acts over which the Board has appellate jurisdiction may appeal a decision or order of an administrative law judge or deputy commissioner to the Board by filing a notice of appeal pursuant to this subpart. (See § 802.205(b) and (c) for exceptions to this general rule.) A party who files a notice of appeal shall be deemed the petitioner. The Director, OWCP, when acting as a representative of the Special Fund established under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act or the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund established by the Black Lung Benefits Act, or, when appealing a decision or order which affects the administration of one of the Acts, shall be considered a party adversely affected.</P>

              <P>(2) When a decision or order is favorable to a party (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the prevailing party), the prevailing party may file a cross-appeal pursuant to § 802.205(b) to challenge any adverse findings of fact or conclusions of law in the same proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Representative parties.</E> In the event that a party has not attained the age of 18, is not mentally competent, or is physically unable to file and pursue or defend an appeal, the Board may permit any legally appointed guardian, committee, or other appropriate representative to file and pursue or defend the appeal, or it may in its discretion appoint such representative for purposes of the appeal. The Board may require any legally appointed representative to submit evidence of that person's authority.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 802.202</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Appearances by attorneys and other authorized persons; denial or authority to appear.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Appearances.</E> Any party or intervenor or any representative duly authorized pursuant to § 802.201(b) may appear before and/or submit written argument to the Board by attorney or any other person, including any representative of an employee organization, duly authorized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Any individual petitioner or respondent or his duly authorized representative pursuant to § 802.201(b) or an officer of any corporate party or a member of any partnership or joint venture which is a party may participate in the appeal on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of such business entity.</P>
              <P>(c) For each instance in which appearance before the Board is made by an attorney or duly authorized person other than the party or his legal guardian, committee, or representative, there shall be filed with the Board a notice of appearance. Any attorney or other duly authorized person of record who intends to withdraw from representation shall file prior written notice of intent to withdraw from representation of a party or of substitution of counsel or other representative.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifications</E>—(1) <E T="03">Attorneys.</E> An attorney at law who is admitted to practice before the Federal courts or before the highest court of any State, <PRTPAGE P="619"/>the District of Columbia, or any territory or commonwealth of the United States, may practice before the Board unless he or she has been disqualified from representing claimants under the Act pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 931(b)(2)(C), or unless authority to appear has been denied pursuant to § 802.202(e)(1) and (3). An attorney's own representation that he or she is in good standing before any of such courts shall be sufficient proof thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Board.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Persons not attorneys.</E> Any person who is not an attorney at law may be admitted to appear in a representative capacity unless he or she has been disqualified from representing claimants under the Act pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 931(b)(2)(C). An application by a person not an attorney at law for admission to appear in a proceeding shall be submitted in writing to the Board at the time such person's appearance is entered. The application shall state such person's name, address, telephone number, general education, any special training or experience in claims representation, and such person's relationship, if any, to the party being represented. The Board may, at any time, make further inquiry as to the qualification or ability of such person to render assistance. In the event of a failure to make application for admission to appear, the Board shall issue an order to show cause why admission to appear should not be denied. Admission to appear in a particular case shall not be deemed a blanket authorization to appear in other cases.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Denial of authority to appear</E>—(1) <E T="03">Attorneys.</E> The Board may deny the privilege of appearing to any attorney, within applicable statutory constraints, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 555, who has been disbarred or suspended from the practice of law; who has surrendered his or her license while under investigation or under threat of disciplinary action; or who, after notice of an opportunity for hearing in the matter is found by the Board to have engaged in any conduct which would result in the loss of his or her license. No provision hereof shall apply to any attorney who appears on his or her own behalf.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Persons not attorneys.</E> The Board may deny the privilege of appearing to any person who, in the Board's judgment, lacks sufficient qualification or ability to render assistance. No provision hereof shall apply to any person who appears on his or her own behalf.</P>
              <P>(3) Denial of authority to appear may be considered, after notice of and opportunity for a hearing, by the panel (constituted pursuant to § 801.301) which is assigned to decide the appeal in which the attorney or other person has entered an appearance. If such proceeding reveals facts suggesting that one of the circumstances described in 33 U.S.C. 931(b)(2)(C) exists, the Board shall refer that information to the Director, OWCP, for further proceedings pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 931(b)(2)(C) and 907(j). An attorney or other person may appeal a panel's decision to deny authority to appear to the entire permanent Board sitting en banc.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees for services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) No fee for services rendered on behalf of a claimant in the successful pursuit or successful defense of an appeal shall be valid unless approved pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 928, as amended.</P>
              <P>(b) All fees for services rendered in the successful pursuit or successful defense of an appeal on behalf of a claimant shall be subject to the provisions and prohibitions contained in 33 U.S.C. 928, as amended.</P>
              <P>(c) Within 60 days of the issuance of a decision or non-interlocutory order by the Board, counsel or, where appropriate, representative for any claimant who has prevailed on appeal before the Board may file an application with the Board for a fee. Where the Board remands the case and the administrative law judge on remand issues an award, a fee petition may be filed within 60 days of the decision on remand. In the event that a claimant who was unsuccessful before the Board prevails on appeal to the court of appeals, his or her representative may within 60 days of issuance of the court's judgment file a fee application with the Board for services performed before the Board.</P>

              <P>(d) A fee application shall include only time spent on services performed while the appeal was pending before the Board and shall be complete in all <PRTPAGE P="620"/>respects, containing all of the following specific information:</P>
              <P>(1) A complete statement of the extent and character of the necessary work done;</P>
              <P>(2) The professional status of each person for whom a fee is claimed who performed services on behalf of the claimant (if such professional status is other than attorney, a definition of the professional status of such individual must be included in the fee petition, including a statment of that individual's professional training, education and experience) and a statement that the attorney was a member in good standing of a state bar at the time the services were performed;</P>
              <P>(3) The number of hours, in <FR>1/4</FR> hour increments, devoted by each person who performed services on behalf of the claimant and the dates on which such services were performed in each category of work;</P>
              <P>(4) The normal billing rate for each person who performed services on behalf of the claimant. The rate awarded by the Board shall be based on what is reasonable and customary in the area where the services were rendered for a person of that particular professional status.</P>
              <P>(e) Any fee approved shall be reasonably commensurate with the necessary work done and shall take into account the quality of the representation, the complexity of the legal issues involved, the amount of benefits awarded, and, when the fee is to be assessed against the claimant, shall also take into account the financial circumstances of the claimant. A fee shall not necessarily be computed by multiplying time devoted to work by an hourly rate.</P>
              <P>(f) No contract pertaining to the amount of a fee shall be recognized.</P>
              <P>(g) A fee application shall be served on all other parties and accompanied by a certificate of service. The Board will not take action on the fee application until such service is effected. Any party may respond to the application within 10 days of receipt of the application. The response shall be filed with the Board and served on all other parties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Effect of motion for reconsideration on time for appeal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A timely motion for reconsideration of a decision or order of an administrative law judge or deputy commissioner shall suspend the running of the time for filing a notice of appeal.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) In a case involving a claim filed under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act or its extensions (see § 802.101(b)(1)-(5)), a timely motion for reconsideration for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is one which is filed not later than 10 days from the date the decision or order was filed in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner.</P>
              <P>(2) In a case involving a claim filed under title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, as amended (see § 802.101(b)(6)), a timely motion for reconsideration for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is one which is filed not later than 30 days from the date the decision or order was served on all parties by the administrative law judge and considered filed in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner (see §§ 725.478 and 725.479(b), (c) of this title).</P>
              <P>(c) If the motion for reconsideration is sent by mail and the fixing of the date of delivery as the date of filing would result in a loss or impairment of reconsideration rights, it will be considered to have been filed as of the date of mailing. The date appearing on the U.S. Postal Service postmark (when available and legible) shall be prima facie evidence of the date of mailing. If there is no such postmark or it is not legible, other evidence such as, but not limited to, certified mail receipts, certificates of service and affidavits may also be used to establish the mailing date.</P>
              <P>(d) If a motion for reconsideration is granted, the full time for filing an appeal commences on the date the subsequent decision or order on reconsideration is filed as provided in § 802.205.</P>

Whether a program qualifies as a formal program is determined on a participant-by-participant basis. A qualifying program qualifies as a formal program with respect to a participant if the participant simultaneously participates in the program in the same physical location with at least two other participants engaged in substantive pension service, and the participants have the opportunity to interact with another individual qualified with respect to the course content who serves as an instructor, whether or not the instructor is in the same physical location. Groups of three or more participants who are in the same physical location may participate in a formal program in person or via the Internet, videoconferencing, or teleconferencing.

Such information shall include sufficient information to establish that all programs designated as qualifying programs offered by the qualifying sponsor will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Recognition as a qualifying sponsor by the Executive Director shall be effective when approved, unless the Executive Director provides that it shall be effective on a different date, and shall terminate at the end of the sponsor enrollment cycle. The Executive Director may publish the names of such sponsors on a periodic basis.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Sponsor enrollment cycle</E>—(A) <E T="03">Transition sponsor enrollment cycle.</E> The transition sponsor enrollment cycle is the period beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2011.</P>

            <P>(v) <E T="03">Certificates of instruction.</E> The program's qualifying sponsor shall furnish to each instructor, discussion leader, or speaker, a certificate listing the following information:</P>

            </P>
            <P>(iii) Presentation of the same material as an instructor, discussion leader, or speaker more than one time in any 36-month period will not qualify for continuing professional education credit.

            <P>(iv) Credit as an instructor, discussion leader, or speaker will not be awarded to panelists, moderators, or others who are not required to prepare substantive subject matter for their portion of the program. However, such individuals may be awarded credit for attendance, provided the other provisions of this section are met.</P>

            <P>(iv) The materials must be available on reasonable terms for acquisition and use by all enrolled actuaries.</P>
            <P>(v) The credit for the creation of materials may not exceed 25 percent of the continuing professional education requirement of any enrollment cycle.</P>
            <P>(vi) The nature of the subject matter will determine if credit will be of a core or non-core nature.</P>
            <P>(vii) Publication of the same material more than one time will not qualify for continuing professional education credit. A publication will not be considered to consist of the same material if a substantial portion has been revised to reflect changes in the law or practices relative to the performance of pension actuarial service.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Service on Joint Board advisory committee(s).</E> Continuing professional education credit may be awarded by the Joint Board for service on (any of) its advisory committee(s), to the extent that the Joint Board considers warranted by the service rendered.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Preparation of Joint Board examinations.</E> Continuing professional education credit may be awarded by the Joint Board for participation in drafting questions for use on Joint Board examinations or in pretesting its examinations, to the extent the Joint Board determines suitable. Such credit may not exceed 50 percent of the continuing professional education requirement for the applicable enrollment cycle.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Examinations sponsored by professional organizations or societies.</E> Individuals may earn continuing professional education credit for achieving a passing grade on proctored examinations sponsored by a professional organization or society recognized by the Joint Board. Such credit is limited to the number of hours scheduled for each examination and may be applied only as non-core credit provided the content of the examination is core or non-core. No credit may be earned for hours attributable to any content that is neither core nor non-core.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Joint Board pension examination.</E> Individuals may establish eligibility for renewal of enrollment for any enrollment cycle by—</P>
            <P>(i) Achieving a passing score on the Joint Board pension examination, as described in § 901.12(d)(1)(i), administered under this part during the applicable enrollment cycle; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Completing a minimum of 12 hours of qualifying continuing professional education by attending formal program(s) during the same applicable enrollment cycle. This option of satisfying the continuing professional education requirements is not available to those who receive initial enrollment during the enrollment cycle.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Measurement of continuing education course work.</E> (1) All continuing education programs will be measured in terms of credit hours. The shortest <PRTPAGE P="639"/>recognized program will be one credit hour.</P>

            <P>(2) A credit hour is 50 minutes of continuous participation in a program. Each session in a program must be at least one full credit hour, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, 50 minutes. For example, a single-session program lasting 100 minutes will count as two credit hours, and a program comprised of three 75 minute sessions (225 minutes) constitutes four credit hours. However, at the end of an enrollment cycle, an individual may total the number of minutes of sessions of at least one credit hour in duration attended during the cycle and divide by fifty. For example, attending three 75 minute segments at two separate programs will accord an individual nine credit hours (450 minutes divided by 50) toward fulfilling the minimum number of continuing professional education hours. It will not be permissible to merge non-core hours with core hours.</P>
            <P>(i) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Qualifying sponsors.</E> A qualifying sponsor must maintain records to verify that each program it sponsors is a qualifying program within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, including the certificates of completion, certificates of instruction, and outlines and course material. In the case of programs of more than one session, records must be maintained to verify each session of the program that is completed by each participant. Records required to be maintained under this paragraph must be retained by the qualifying sponsor for a period of six years following the end of the sponsor enrollment cycle in which the program is held.</P>

            <P>(2) A request for waiver must be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The individual will be required to furnish any additional documentation or explanation deemed necessary by the Executive Director.</P>

            <P>(3) The individual will be notified by the Executive Director of the disposition of the request for waiver. If the waiver is not approved, and the individual does not otherwise satisfy the <PRTPAGE P="640"/>continuing professional education requirements within the allotted time, the individual will be placed on the roster of inactive enrolled individuals.</P>
            <P>(4) Individuals seeking to rely on a waiver of the continuing professional education requirements must receive the waiver from the Executive Director before filing an application for renewal of enrollment.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Failure to comply.</E> (1) Compliance by an individual with the requirements of this part shall be determined by the Executive Director. An individual who applies for renewal of enrollment but who fails to meet the requirements of eligibility for renewal will be notified by the Executive Director at his/her last known address by first class mail. The notice will state the basis for the non-compliance and will provide the individual an opportunity to furnish in writing, within 60 days of the date of the notice, information relating to the matter. Such information will be considered by the Executive Director in making a final determination as to eligibility for renewal of enrollment.</P>
            <P>(2) The Executive Director may require any individual, by first class mail sent to his/her mailing address of record with the Joint Board, to provide copies of any records required to be maintained under this section. The Executive Director may disallow any continuing professional education hours claimed if the individual concerned fails to comply with such requirements.</P>
            <P>(3) An individual whose application for renewal is not approved may seek review of the matter by the Joint Board. A request for review and the reasons in support of the request must be filed with the Joint Board within 30 days of the date of the notice of failure to comply.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Inactive status</E>—(i) <E T="03">Automatic placement on the inactive roster.</E> To remain on the roster of active enrolled actuaries, an enrolled actuary must submit a timely application for renewal showing satisfaction of the requirements for reenrollment, including completion of the required continuing professional education hours, within the appropriate time frame. The Executive Director will move an enrolled actuary who does not submit such an application for reenrollment from the roster of enrolled actuaries to the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries as of April 1 following the March 1 due date for the application. However, if an enrolled actuary completes the required number of continuing professional education hours after the close of the enrollment cycle, submits an application for reenrollment, and is informed by the Executive Director before April 1st that the enrollment has been renewed, then the Executive Director will not move such individual to the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries at that time.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Placement on the inactive roster after notice and right to respond.</E> The Executive Director will move an enrolled actuary who does not submit a timely application of renewal that shows timely completion of the required continuing professional education to the inactive roster only after giving the enrolled actuary 60 days to respond as described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Length on time on inactive roster.</E> An individual may remain on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries for a period up to three enrollment cycles from the date renewal would have been effective.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Consequence of being on the inactive roster.</E> An individual in inactive status will be ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. During such time in inactive status or at any other time an individual is ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary, the individual shall not in any manner, directly or indirectly, indicate he or she is so enrolled, or use the term “enrolled actuary,” the designation “E.A.,” or other form of reference to eligibility to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Returning to active status.</E> An individual placed in inactive status may return to active status by filing an application for renewal of enrollment (with the appropriate fee) and providing evidence of the completion of all required continuing professional education hours and of satisfaction of any applicable requirements for qualifying experience under paragraph (l)(7) of <PRTPAGE P="641"/>this section. If an application for return to active status is approved, the individual will be eligible to perform services as an enrolled actuary effective with the date the notice of approval is mailed to that individual by the Executive Director.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Time for return to active enrollment.</E> (i) An individual placed in inactive status must file an application for return to active enrollment, and satisfy the requirements for return to active enrollment as set forth in this section, within three enrollment cycles of being placed in inactive status. Otherwise, the name of such individual will be removed from the inactive enrollment roster and his/her enrollment will terminate.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section, an individual who is in inactive or retired status as of April 1, 2010, will be deemed to have been placed in inactive status on April 1, 2010.</P>
            <P>(6) An individual in inactive status may satisfy the requirements for return to active enrollment at any time during his/her period of inactive enrollment. If only completion of the continuing professional education requirement is necessary, the application for return to active enrollment may be filed immediately upon such completion. If qualifying experience is also required, the application for return to active enrollment may not be filed until the completion of both the continuing professional education and qualifying experience requirements set forth in this subsection. Continuing professional education credits applied to meet the requirements for reenrollment under this paragraph (l)(6) may not be used to satisfy the requirements of the enrollment cycle in which the individual has been placed back on the active roster.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Continuing professional education requirements for return to active enrollment from inactive status.</E> (i) During the first inactive enrollment cycle; 36 hours of qualifying continuing professional education as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, without regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(2)(iii) of this section, must be completed. Any hours of continuing professional education credit earned during the immediately prior enrollment cycle may be applied in satisfying this requirement.</P>
            <P>(ii) During the second inactive enrollment cycle; four-thirds of the qualifying continuing professional education requirements as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (that is, 48 hours), without regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(2)(iii) of this section, plus eighteen months of certified responsible pension actuarial experience, must be completed since the start of the first inactive enrollment cycle. Any hours of continuing professional education credit earned during the first inactive enrollment cycle may be applied in satisfying this requirement.</P>
            <P>(iii) During the third inactive enrollment cycle: Five-thirds of the qualifying continuing professional education requirements as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, (that is, 60 hours), without regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(2)(iii) of this section plus eighteen months of certified responsible pension actuarial experience, must be completed since the start of the second inactive enrollment cycle. Any hours of continuing professional education credit earned during the second inactive enrollment cycle may be applied in satisfying this requirement. No hours earned during the first inactive enrollment cycle may be applied in satisfying this requirement.</P>
            <P>(8) An individual in inactive status remains subject to the jurisdiction of the Joint Board and/or the Department of the Treasury with respect to disciplinary matters.</P>

            <P>(9) An individual who has certified in good faith that he/she has satisfied the continuing professional education requirements of this section will not be considered to be in non-compliance with such requirements on the basis of a program he/she has attended later being found inadequate or not in compliance with the requirements for continuing professional education. Such individual will be granted renewal, but the Executive Director may require such individual to remedy the resulting shortfall by earning replacement credit during the cycle in which renewal was granted or within a reasonable time period as determined by the Executive Director. For example, if six of the credit hours claimed were disallowed, <PRTPAGE P="642"/>the individual may be required to present 42 credit hours instead of the minimum 36 credit hours to qualify for renewal related to the next cycle.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Renewal while under suspension or disbarment.</E> An individual who is ineligible to perform actuarial services and/or to practice before the Internal Revenue Service by virtue of disciplinary action is required to meet the requirements for renewal of enrollment during the period of such ineligibility.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Verification.</E> The Executive Director or his/her designee may request and review the continuing professional education records of an enrolled actuary, including programs attended, in a manner deemed appropriate to determine compliance with the requirements and standards for the renewal of enrollment as provided in this section. The Executive Director may also request and review the records of any qualifying sponsor in a manner deemed appropriate to determine compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(3) and (j)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the rules of paragraph (l)(7) of this section and the effective date of an enrolled actuary's renewal:

              <P>Individual E, who was initially enrolled before January 1, 2008, completes 12 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. E files a complete application for reenrollment on February 28, 2014. E's reenrollment is effective as of April 1, 2014.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>Individual F, who was initially enrolled before January 1, 2008, also completes 12 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. However, F does not file an application for reenrollment until March 20, 2014. The Joint Board notifies F that it has granted F's application on June 25, 2014. Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, F is placed on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries. F returns to active status as of June 25, 2014. F is ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code from April 1 through June 24, 2014.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
              <P>Individual G, who was initially enrolled before January 1, 2008, completes only 8 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. G completes another 6 hours of core continuing professional education on January 15, 2014, and files an application for return to active status on January 20, 2014. G's application shows the timely completion of 32 hours of continuing professional education plus the additional 4 hours of continuing professional education earned after the end of the enrollment cycle. The Joint Board notifies G that it has granted the application on April 20, 2014. Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, G is placed on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries. G returns to active status as of April 20, 2014. G is ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code from April 1 through April 19, 2014. Of the 6 hours of continuing professional education earned by G on January 15, 2014, only 2 hours may be applied to the enrollment cycle that ends December 31, 2016.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4.</HD>
              <P>(i) Individual H, who was initially enrolled before January 1, 2008, completes 5 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 10 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, H is placed on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries and is ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
              <P>(ii) H completes 7 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 14 hours of noncore continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2014, and May 24, 2016. Because H has completed 12 hours of core continuing professional education and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional education during the last active enrollment period and the initial period when on inactive status, H has satisfied the requirements for reenrollment during the first inactive cycle. Accordingly, H may file an application for return to active enrollment on May 24, 2016. If this application is approved, H will be eligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, effective with the date of such approval.</P>
              <P>(iii) Because H used the 21 hours of continuing professional education credit earned after January 1, 2014, for return from inactive status, H may not apply any of these 21 hours of core and non-core continuing professional education credits towards the requirements for renewed enrollment effective April 1, 2017. Accordingly, H must complete an additional 36 hours of continuing professional education (12 core and 24 non-core) prior to December 31, 2016, to be eligible for renewed enrollment effective April 1, 2017.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5.</HD>
              <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 4</E> except H completes 2 hours of core continuing professional education credit and <PRTPAGE P="643"/>8 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016. Thus, because H did not fulfill the requirements for return to active status during his first inactive cycle, H must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (l)(7)(ii) of this section in order to return to active status.</P>
              <P>(ii) Accordingly, in order to be eligible to file an application for return to active status on or before December 31, 2019, H must complete an additional 38 hours of continuing professional education credit (of which at least 14 hours must consist of core subject matter) between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, and have 18 months of certified responsible pension actuarial experience during the period beginning on January 1, 2014.</P>
              <P>(iii) Note that the 5 hours of core continuing professional education credit and the 10 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit that H completes between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, are not counted toward H's return to active status and are also not taken into account toward the additional hours of continuing professional education credit that H must complete between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, in order to apply for renewal of enrollment effective April 1, 2020.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 6.</HD>
              <P>(i) The facts are the same as in <E T="03">Example 4</E> except H completes 2 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 8 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, and 12 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 24 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Thus, because H did not fulfill the requirements for return to active status during his first or second inactive cycles, H must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (l)(7)(iii) of this section in order to return to active status.</P>
              <P>(ii) Accordingly, in order to be eligible to file an application for return to active status on or before December 31, 2022, H must complete an additional 24 hours of continuing professional education credit (of which, at least 8 hours must consist of core subject matter) between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, and have at least 18 months of certified responsible pension actuarial experience during the period beginning on January 1, 2017.</P>
              <P>(iii) Note that the total of 15 hours of continuing professional education credit that H completes between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, as well as the 10 hours of continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, are not counted toward H's return to active status and are not taken into account toward the additional hours of continuing professional education credit that H must complete between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, in order to be eligible to file an application for renewal of enrollment active status effective April 1, 2023.</P>

Accordingly, effective April 1, 2014, J is placed on the roster of inactive enrolled actuaries and is ineligible to perform pension actuarial services as an enrolled actuary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
              <P>(ii) J completes 5 hours of core continuing professional education credit and 4 hours of non-core continuing professional education credit between January 1, 2014, and October 6, 2014. Because J did not complete the required 12 hours of continuing professional education (of which at least 6 hours must consist of core subject matter) during J's initial enrollment cycle, J is not eligible to file an application for a return to active enrollment on October 6, 2014, notwithstanding the fact that had J completed such hours between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, J would have satisfied the requirements for renewed enrollment effective April 1, 2014.</P>
              <P>(iii) Accordingly, J must complete an additional 24 hours of continuing professional education (of which at least 12 hours must consist of core subject matter) during his/her first inactive enrollment cycle before applying for renewal of enrollment.</P>

Accordingly, because as of February 12, 2015, J satisfied the continuing professional education requirements as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section without regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) thereof, J may file an application for return to active enrollment status on February 12, 2015.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards of performance of actuarial services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In the discharge of duties required by ERISA of enrolled actuaries with respect to any plan to which the Act applies:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> An enrolled actuary shall undertake an actuarial assignment only when qualified to do so.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Professional duty.</E> (1) An enrolled actuary shall perform actuarial services only in a manner that is fully in accordance with all of the duties and requirements for such persons under applicable law and consistent with relevant generally accepted standards for professional responsibility and ethics.</P>

            <P>(2) An enrolled actuary shall not perform actuarial services for any person <PRTPAGE P="646"/>or organization which he/she believes, or has reasonable grounds to believe, may utilize his/her services in a fraudulent manner or in a manner inconsistent with law.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Advice or explanations.</E> An enrolled actuary shall provide to the plan administrator upon appropriate request, supplemental advice or explanation relative to any report signed or certified by such enrolled actuary.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an enrolled actuary shall not perform actuarial services for a client if the representation involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists if—</P>
            <P>(i) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or</P>
            <P>(ii) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the enrolled actuary's responsibilities to another client, a former client, or by a personal interest of the enrolled actuary.</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict of interest under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the enrolled actuary may represent a client if—</P>
            <P>(i) The enrolled actuary reasonably believes that he or she will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;</P>
            <P>(ii) The representation is not prohibited by law; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Each affected client waives the conflict of interest and gives informed consent at the time the existence of the conflict of interest is known by the enrolled actuary.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Assumptions, calculations and recommendations.</E> (1) The enrolled actuary shall exercise due care, skill, prudence and diligence when performing actuarial services under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. In particular, in the course of preparing a report or certificate stating actuarial costs or liabilities, the enrolled actuary shall ensure that—</P>
            <P>(i) Except as mandated by law, the actuarial assumptions are reasonable individually and in combination, and the actuarial cost method and the actuarial method of valuation of assets are appropriate;</P>
            <P>(ii) The calculations are accurately carried out and properly documented; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The report, any recommendations, and any supplemental advice or explanation relative to the report reflect the results of the calculations.</P>
            <P>(2) An enrolled actuary shall include in any report or certificate stating actuarial costs or liabilities, a statement or reference describing or clearly identifying the data, any material inadequacies therein and the implications thereof, and the actuarial methods and assumptions employed.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Due diligence.</E> (1) An enrolled actuary must exercise due diligence—</P>
            <P>(i) In preparing or assisting in the preparation of, approving, and filing tax returns, documents, affidavits, and other papers relating to the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or any other applicable Federal or State entity;</P>
            <P>(ii) In determining the correctness of oral or written representations made by the enrolled actuary to the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or any other applicable Federal or State entity; and</P>
            <P>(iii) In determining the correctness of oral or written representations made by the enrolled actuary to clients.</P>
            <P>(2) An enrolled actuary advising a client to take a position on any document to be filed with the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or any other applicable Federal or State entity (or preparing or signing such a return or document) generally may rely in good faith without verification upon information furnished by the client. The enrolled actuary may not, however, ignore the implications of information furnished to, or actually known by, the enrolled actuary, and must make reasonable inquiries if the information as furnished appears to be incorrect, inconsistent with an important fact or another factual assumption, or incomplete.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Solicitations regarding actuarial services.</E> An enrolled actuary may not in any way use or participate in the use of any form of public communication or private solicitation related to <PRTPAGE P="647"/>the performance of actuarial services containing a false, fraudulent, or coercive statement or claim, or a misleading or deceptive statement or claim. An enrolled actuary may not make, directly or indirectly, an uninvited written or oral solicitation of employment related to actuarial services if the solicitation violates Federal or State law, nor may such person employ, accept employment in partnership form, corporate form, or any other form, or share fees with, any individual or entity who so solicits. Any lawful solicitation related to the performance of actuarial services made by or on behalf of an enrolled actuary must clearly identify the solicitation as such and, if applicable, identify the source of the information used in choosing the recipient.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Prompt disposition of pending matters.</E> An enrolled actuary may not unreasonably delay the prompt disposition of any matter before the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or any other applicable Federal or State entity.</P>
            <P>(i) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Return of client's records.</E> (1) In general, an enrolled actuary must, at the request of a client, promptly return any and all records of the client that are necessary for the client to comply with his or her legal obligations. The enrolled actuary may retain copies of the records returned to a client. The existence of a dispute over fees generally does not relieve the enrolled actuary of his or her responsibility under this section. Nevertheless, if applicable State law allows or permits the retention of a client's records by an enrolled actuary in the case of a dispute over fees for services rendered, the enrolled actuary need only return those records that must be attached to the client's required forms under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The enrolled actuary, however, must provide the client with reasonable access to review and copy any additional records of the client retained by the enrolled actuary under State law that are necessary for the client to comply with his or her obligations under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this section, records of the client include all documents or written or electronic materials provided to the enrolled actuary, or obtained by the enrolled actuary in the course of the enrolled actuary's representation of the client, that preexisted the retention of the enrolled actuary by the client. The term “records of the client” also includes materials that were prepared by the client or a third party (not including an employee or agent of the enrolled actuary) at any time and provided to the enrolled actuary with respect to the subject matter of the representation. The term “records of the client” also includes any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document prepared by the enrolled actuary, or his or her employee or agent, that was presented to the client with respect to a prior representation if such document is necessary for the taxpayer to comply with his or her current obligations under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The term “records of the client” does not include any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document prepared by the enrolled actuary or the enrolled actuary's firm, employees or agents if the enrolled actuary is withholding such document pending the client's performance of its contractual obligation to pay fees with respect to such document.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Notification.</E> An enrolled actuary shall provide written notification of the non-filing of any actuarial document he/she has signed upon discovery of the non-filing. Such notification shall be made to the office of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation where such document should have been filed.</P>
            <P>(l) The rules of this section apply to all actuarial services and related acts performed on or after May 2, 2011.</P>

Such other conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following:</P>

A reprimand as used in this paragraph is a <PRTPAGE P="649"/>statement informing the enrolled actuary that, in the opinion of the Executive Director, his/her conduct is in violation of the regulations and admonishing the enrolled actuary that repetition of the conduct occasioning the reprimand may result in the institution of a proceeding for the suspension or termination of the actuary's enrollment. A proceeding for suspension or termination of enrollment shall be initiated by a complaint naming the respondent actuary, signed by the Executive Director and filed in the Executive Director's office. Except in cases where the nature of the proceeding or the public interest does not permit, a proceeding will not be initiated under this section until the facts which may warrant such a proceeding have been called to the attention of the actuary in writing and he/she has been given an opportunity to respond to the allegations of misconduct.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> All records of the Joint Board, including information set forth in section 552(a)(2) of title 5 of the United States Code, are made available to any person, upon request, for inspection and copying in accordance with the provisions of this section and subject to the limitations stated in section 552(b) of title 5 of the United States Code. Records falling within such limitations may nevertheless be made available in accordance with this section to the extent consistent, in the judgment of the Chairman of the Joint Board (“Chairman”), with the effective performance of the Joint Board's statutory responsibilities and with the avoidance of injury to a public or private interest intended to be protected by such limitations.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Obtaining access to records.</E> Records of the Joint Board subject to <PRTPAGE P="655"/>this section are available by appointment for public inspection or copying during regular business hours on regular business days at the office of the Executive Director. Every request for access to such records, other than published records described in § 902.3, shall be signed and submitted in writing to the Executive Director, Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, c/o Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220, shall state the name and address of the person requesting such access, and shall describe such records in a manner reasonably sufficient to permit their identification without undue difficulty.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees.</E> A fee at the rate of $5.00 per hour or fraction thereof or the time required to locate such records, plus ten cents per standard page for any copying thereof, shall be paid by any person requesting records other than published records described in § 902.3. In addition, the cost of postage and any packaging and special handling shall be paid by the requester. Documents shall be provided without charge or at a reduced charge where the Chairman determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Actions on requests.</E> The Executive Director shall, within ten days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) from receipt of request, determine whether to comply with such request for records and shall immediately notify in writing the person making such request of such determination and the reason therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal any adverse determination, as provided in § 902.5. In unusual circumstances, the time limit for the determination may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which the determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that will result in an extension of more than ten working days.</P>

The appeal shall provide the name and address of the appellant, the identification of the records denied, and the dates of the original request and its denial.</P>
          <P>(b) The Joint Board shall act upon any such appeal within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) of its receipt, unless for unusual circumstances the time for such action is deferred, subject to § 902.4(b), for not more than ten days. If action upon any such appeal is so deferred, the Joint Board shall notify the requester of the reasons for such deferral and the date on which the final reply is expected to be dispatched. If it is determined that the appeal from the initial denial shall be denied (in whole or in part), the requester shall be notified in writing of the denial, of the reasons therefor, of the fact the Joint Board is responsible for the denial, and of the provisions of section 552(a)(4) of title 5 of the United States Code for judicial review of the determination.</P>
          <P>(c) Any extension or extensions of time under §§ 902.4(d) and 902.5(b) shall not cumulatively total more than ten days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays). If an extension is invoked in connection with an initial determination under § 902.4(d), any unused days of such extension may be invoked in connection with the determination on appeal under § 902.5(a), by written notice from the Joint Board.</P>

            <P>The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).

They do not relate to personnel records of Government employees, which are under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission, and, thus, subject to regulations issued by such Commission. The regulations set forth the procedures by which individuals may request notification of whether the Joint Board maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such records maintained in any non-exempt system of records, request amendment of such records, and appeal any initial adverse determination with respect to any such request.</P>

These methods are as follows: Subsection (c)(3) allows individuals to discover if other agencies are investigating such individuals; subsections (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) establish the ability of individuals to gain access to investigatory material compiled on such individuals; subsections (d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4) presuppose access and enable individuals to contest the contents of investigatory material compiled on these individuals; and subsections (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) allow individuals to determine whether or not they are under investigation. Because these subsections are variations upon the individual's ability to ascertain whether his civil or criminal misconduct has been discovered, these subsections have been grouped together for purposes of this notice.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) The Joint Board believes that imposition of the requirements of subsection (c)(3), which requires that accountings of disclosures be made available to individuals, would impair the ability of the Joint Board and other investigative entities to conduct investigations of alleged or suspected violations of the regulations governing the performance of actuarial services with respect to plans to which the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) applies, and of civil or criminal laws. Making the accountings of disclosures available to individuals enables such individuals to identify entities investigating them and thereby to determine the nature of the violations of which they are suspected. With such knowledge, individuals would be able to alter their illegal activities, destroy or alter evidence of such activities and seriously impair the successful completion of investigations. For these reasons, the Joint Board claims exemption from the requirements of subsection (c)(3) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to subsections (d)(1), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(2), (3) and (5), the Joint Board believes that access to investigatory material would prevent the successful completion of investigations. Individuals who gain access to investigatory material involving them discover the nature and extent of the violations of regulations, and of civil and criminal laws, of which they are suspected. By gaining access, such individuals also learn the facts developed during investigations. Knowledge of these matters enables these individuals to destroy or alter evidence which would otherwise have been used against them. In addition, knowledge of the facts and suspected violations gives individuals, who are committing ongoing violations, or who are about to commit violations of regulations, or of civil or criminal laws, the opportunity to temporarily postpone the commission of the violations or to effectively disguise the commission of these violations. Material compiled on investigated individuals reveals investigative techniques and procedures, disclosure of which enables such individuals to structure their illegal activities so as to escape detection. Further, such material may contain, or by its very nature reveal, the identity of confidential sources. When the identities of confidential sources are revealed, they may be subjected to various forms of reprisal. If confidential sources of information are subjected to actual reprisals or fear thereof, they may become reluctant to provide information necessary to identify or prove the guilt of persons who violate regulations, or civil or criminal laws. Further, the protections afforded by the above-referenced subsections are unnecessary because the Joint Board may not deny enrollment or suspend or terminate the enrollment of an individual to perform actuarial services until it has provided such individual with due process safeguards. For these reasons, the Joint Board claims exemptions from the requirements of subsections (d)(1), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(2), (3), and (5) of the Act.</P>

            <P>(iii) With respect to subsections (d) (2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4), the Joint Board believes that the imposition of these requirements, which presuppose access and provide for amending records, would impair the ability to conduct investigations and would be unnecessary for the same reasons stated in the preceding subsection (2)(ii). These reasons herein are incorporated by reference. Therefore, the Joint <PRTPAGE P="663"/>Board claims exemptions from the requirements of subsections (d)(2), (3), and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4).</P>
            <P>(iv) With respect to subsections (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1), the Joint Board believes that informing individuals that they are the subjects of a particular system or systems of records would impair the ability of the Joint Board and its agents to successfully complete investigations of suspected or alleged violators of the regulations governing the performance of actuarial services with respect to plans to which ERISA applies. Individuals who learn that they are suspected of violating said regulations are given the opportunity to destroy or alter evidence needed to prove the alleged violations. Such individuals may also be able to impair investigations by temporarily suspending or restructuring the activities which place them in violation of said regulations. Further, as noted in the preceding subsection (2)(ii) and incorporated by reference herein, the procedural requirements imposed on the Joint Board by ERISA make the protections afforded by subsections (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) unnecessary. For these reasons, the Joint Board claims exemptions from the requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1).</P>
            <P>(v) Subsection (e)(1) of the Privacy Act of 1974 requires that the Joint Board maintain in its records only information that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Office required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President. The Joint Board believes that imposition of said requirement would seriously impair its ability, and the abilities of its agents and other investigative entities to effectively investigate suspected or alleged violations of regulations and of civil or criminal laws. The Joint Board does not initiate inquires into individuals' conduct unless it receives information evidencing violation by such individuals of the regulations governing performance of actuarial services with respect to plans to which ERISA applies. Sources of such information may be unfamiliar with the Joint Board's interpretations of said regulations and, therefore, may not always provide only relevant and necessary information. Therefore, it may often be impossible to determine whether or not information is relevant and necessary. For these reasons, the Joint Board claims exemption from the requirements of subsection (e)(1).</P>
            <P>(vi) Subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Privacy Act of 1974 requires the publication of the categories of sources of records in each system of records. The Joint Board believes that imposition of said requirement would seriously impair its ability to obtain information from such sources for the following reasons. Revealing such categories of sources could disclose investigative techniques and procedures and could cause sources to decline to provide information because of fear of reprisal, or fear of breaches of promises of confidentiality. For these reasons, the Joint Board claims exemption from the requirements of subsection (e)(4)(I).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Method of calculating State basic grant awards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining the amount of funds available to each State, the ratio of the number of veterans seeking employment in the State to the number of veterans seeking employment in all States will be used.</P>
            <P>(b) The number of veterans seeking employment will be determined based on the number of veterans in the civilian labor force and the number of unemployed persons. The civilian labor force data will be obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the unemployment data will be obtained from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS), both of which are compiled by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.</P>
            <P>(c) Each State's basic grant allocation will be determined by dividing the number of unemployed persons in each State by the number of unemployed persons across all States (LAUS for the individual States / LAUS for all States) and by dividing the number of veterans in the civilian labor force in each State by the number of veterans in the civilian labor force across all States (CPS for the individual States / CPS for all States). The result of these two ratios will be averaged and converted to a percentage of veterans seeking employment in the State compared to the percentage of veterans seeking employment in all States. Three-year averages of the CPS and LAUS data will be used in calculating the funding formula to stabilize the effect of annual fluctuations in the data in order to avoid undue fluctuations in the annual basic grant amounts allocated to States.</P>
            <P>(d) State Plans are prepared in response to estimated basic grant allocation amounts prepared by the Department of Labor, based upon a projection of the appropriation. Variations from Department of Labor projections will be treated as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) If the actual appropriation varies from the projection, the Secretary will make every reasonable effort to avoid recalculating the estimated basic grant allocation amounts, in order to maintain the delivery of services to veterans and to minimize the administrative workload required to recalculate grant allocations and to revise State Plans. Therefore upon enactment and allotment of an appropriated amount, it is the Department's intent to proceed by awarding the estimated basic grant allocation amounts to State agencies, unless the difference between the projection and the appropriation creates a compelling reason to do otherwise.</P>
            <P>(2) If the actual appropriation exceeds the projection, the Secretary will determine whether the appropriation and the projection is large enough to warrant recalculating the State basic grant amounts. In such case, state basic grant amounts will be recalculated in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. If it is determined that no compelling reason to recalculate exists, the increased amount available for basic grants will be retained as undistributed funds. These undistributed basic grant funds will be retained separately from the funds retained for TAP workload and other exigencies, as established by § 1001.151(a). The intent will be to award these undistributed basic grant funds to States as basic grant supplements, in response to circumstances arising during the applicable fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(3) If the actual appropriation falls below the projection, the Secretary will determine whether the lower appropriation creates a compelling reason to recalculate the State basic grant amounts. If it is determined that not recalculating the State basic grant amounts would jeopardize the availability of sufficient funding for TAP workload and other exigencies, a compelling reason to recalculate would exist. In that case, the State basic grant amounts will be recalculated under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section in response to the reduced appropriation, to the extent required to assure that sufficient funding is available for TAP workload and other exigencies.</P>

            <P>(a) Up to four percent of the total amount available for allocation will be available for distribution based on Transition Assistance Program (TAP) workload and other exigencies.</P>

            <P>(b) Funding for TAP workshops will be allocated on a per workshop basis. <PRTPAGE P="673"/>Funding to the States will be provided pursuant to the approved State Plan.</P>
            <P>(c) Funds for exigent circumstances, such as unusually high levels of unemployment, surges in the demand for transitioning services, including the need for TAP workshops, will be allocated based on need.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Hold-harmless criteria and minimum funding level.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A hold-harmless rate of 90 percent of the prior year's funding level will be applied after the funding formula phase-in period is completed (beginning fiscal year 2006 and subsequent years).</P>
            <P>(b) A hold-harmless rate of 80 percent of the prior year's funding level will be applied for fiscal year 2005.</P>
            <P>(c) A minimum funding level is established to ensure that in any year, no State will receive less than 0.28 percent (.0028) of the previous year's total funding for all States.</P>
            <P>(d) If the appropriation for a given fiscal year does not provide sufficient funds to comply with the hold-harmless provision, the Department will:</P>
            <P>(1) Update, as appropriate, the States' estimates of TAP workload and reserve sufficient funds for that purpose from the total amount available for allocation to the States. Beyond TAP workload, no funds will be reserved for exigent circumstances because the shortfall in the appropriation will be the primary exigent circumstance to be addressed.</P>
            <P>(2) Apply proportionally the remaining balance available for basic grant allocations to the States for that fiscal year. The proportion will be calculated by dividing the remaining balance available for allocation by the total estimated State basic grant allocations for that fiscal year. The proportion resulting from that calculation will be applied to each State's estimated basic grant allocation to calculate the amount to be awarded.</P>

            <P>(a) The first stage of implementation begins with application of this subpart G to the first program year following May 10, 2013. As of that date, veteran is defined as it is in 38 U.S.C. 4211(4), as a person who:</P>
            <P>(1) Served on active duty for a period of more than 180 days and was discharged or released therefrom with other than a dishonorable discharge;</P>
            <P>(2) Was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability;</P>
            <P>(3) As a member of a reserve component under an order to active duty pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 12301(a), (d), or (g), 12302, or 12304, served on active duty during a period of war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge is authorized and was discharged or released from such duty with other than a dishonorable discharge; or</P>
            <P>(4) Was discharged or released from active duty by reason of a sole survivorship discharge (as that term is defined in 10 U.S.C.1174(i)).</P>
            <P>(b) The second stage of implementation begins with the first day of the program year that begins two years after the first day of the program year that State grantees begin collecting and maintaining data as required by 20 CFR 1010.330(c). As of that date, veteran will be defined as it is in 20 CFR 1010.110:</P>
            <P>(1) A person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released there from under conditions other than dishonorable, as specified in 38 U.S.C. 101(2).</P>
            <P>(2) Active service includes full-time Federal service in the National Guard or a Reserve component, other than full-time duty for training purposes.</P>
            <P>(c) During the second stage of implementation, any veteran who meets the definition specified in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered to meet the definition specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) For purposes of this part, we use the EER for veterans and eligible persons. This is the EER as applied to veterans (as defined in § 1001.162) and eligible persons (as defined in § 1001.161) who are participants in State employment service delivery systems.</P>
            <P>(b) The EER for veterans and eligible persons measures the number of the participants described in paragraph (a) of this section who are employed after exiting an employment service delivery system compared to the total number of those participants who exited. We will issue policy guidance to establish the method of calculating the EER.</P>
            <P>(c) The national EER for veterans and eligible persons is the EER achieved by the national State employment service delivery system for those veterans and eligible persons who are participants in all of the State employment service delivery systems for the program year under review. The national EER resulting from this calculation is expressed as a percentage that is rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.</P>

            <P>(d) A State's program year EER is the EER for veterans and eligible persons (as calculated in paragraph (b) of this section) achieved by a single State's employment service delivery system for those veterans and eligible persons who are included in the EER measure for that State's employment <PRTPAGE P="675"/>service delivery system for the program year under review.

State agencies that do not achieve a program year EER that equals or exceeds the uniform national threshold EER (90 percent of the national EER) for the year under review will be subject to a review by VETS, with input from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), to determine whether the program year EER is deficient.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Review.</E> For each State whose program year EER is subject to review to determine deficiency, the review will consider the degree of difference between the State's program year EER and the uniform national threshold EER for that program year, as well as the annual unemployment data for the State as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</P>
            <P>(1) The review also may consider other relevant measures of prevailing economic conditions and regional economic conditions, as well as other measures of the performance of workforce programs and/or any information the State may submit.</P>
            <P>(2) The review will include consultation with VETS and ETA field staff about findings from their on-site reviews and desk audits of State agency implementation of policies and procedures for services to veterans and also may include consultation with staff affiliated with other agencies of the Department, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirement of a CAP.</E> After review, a State whose program year EER is determined not to be deficient will be notified that a CAP will not be required; a State whose program year EER is determined to be deficient will be required to submit a CAP to improve the State's performance in assisting veterans to meet their employment needs as a condition of receiving its next-due JVSG.</P>
            <P>(1) Any State whose program year EER has been determined to be deficient will be notified by March 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the program year under review ended.</P>
            <P>(2) For any State that is required to submit a CAP, VETS will provide technical assistance (TA), with input from ETA, on the development of the CAP. The CAP must be submitted to the Grant Officer's Technical Representative by June 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the program year under review ended.</P>
            <P>(3) We will review the CAP submitted by the State and determine, with input from ETA, whether to approve it or to provide additional TA to the State.</P>
            <P>(i) If we approve the CAP, the State must expeditiously implement it.</P>
            <P>(ii) If we do not approve the CAP, we will take such steps as are necessary to implement corrective actions to improve the State's EER for veterans and eligible persons.</P>

            <P>(4) If a State fails to take the actions we impose under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and Training may take any actions available to remedy non-compliance under 20 CFR <PRTPAGE P="676"/>1001.130(a) (referring to the compliance measures discussed in 20 CFR part 658, subpart H).</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1001.167</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>In addition to the procedures specified in this part, will the Department be conducting any other monitoring of compliance regarding services to veterans?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes. We will continue to monitor compliance with the regulations on veterans' priority of service at 20 CFR 1010.240(b) jointly with the ETA. If a State's program year EER is determined to be deficient for a given program year, that deficiency would constitute information to be considered in monitoring priority of service, since failure to fully implement priority of service could be one of the contributors to a deficient program year EER.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this part?</SUBJECT>
              <P>This part implements the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (“USERRA” or “the Act”). 38 U.S.C. 4301-4334. USERRA is a law that establishes certain rights and benefits for employees, and duties for employers. USERRA affects employment, reemployment, and retention in employment, when employees serve or have served in the uniformed services. There are five subparts to these regulations. Subpart A gives an introduction to the USERRA regulations. Subpart B describes USERRA's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions. Subpart C explains the steps that must be taken by a uniformed service member who wants to return to his or her previous civilian employment. Subpart D describes the rights, benefits, and obligations of persons absent from employment due to service in the uniformed services, including rights and obligations related to health plan coverage. Subpart E describes the rights, benefits, and obligations of the returning veteran or service member. Subpart F explains the role of the Department of Labor in enforcing and giving assistance under USERRA. These regulations implement USERRA as it applies to States, local governments, and private employers. Separate regulations published by the Federal Office of Personnel Management implement USERRA for Federal executive agency employers and employees.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is USERRA a new law?</SUBJECT>
              <P>USERRA is the latest in a series of laws protecting veterans' employment and reemployment rights going back to the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. USERRA's immediate predecessor was commonly referred to as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (VRRA), which was enacted as section 404 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. In enacting USERRA, Congress emphasized USERRA's continuity with the VRRA and its intention to clarify and strengthen that law. Congress also emphasized that Federal laws protecting veterans' employment and reemployment rights for the past fifty years had been successful and that the large body of case law that had developed under those statutes remained in full force and effect, to the extent it is consistent with USERRA. USERRA authorized the Department of Labor to publish regulations implementing the Act for State, local government, and private employers. USERRA also authorized the Office of Personnel Management to issue regulations implementing the Act for Federal executive agencies (other than some Federal intelligence agencies). USERRA established a separate program for employees of some Federal intelligence agencies.</P>

              <P>(a) USERRA charges the Secretary of Labor (through the Veterans' Employment and Training Service) with providing assistance to any person with respect to the employment and reemployment rights and benefits to which such person is entitled under the Act.

              <P>(b) USERRA also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations implementing the Act with respect to States, local governments, and private employers. These regulations are issued under this authority.</P>

              <P>USERRA's definition of “service in the uniformed services” covers all categories of military training and service, including duty performed on a voluntary or involuntary basis, in time of peace or war. Although most often understood as applying to National Guard and reserve military personnel, USERRA also applies to persons serving in the active components of the Armed Forces. Certain types of service specified in 42 U.S.C. 300hh-11 by members of the National Disaster Medical System are covered by USERRA.</P>

              <P>(a) USERRA establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the employment and reemployment rights and benefits of those it protects. In other words, an employer may provide greater rights and benefits than USERRA requires, but no employer can refuse to provide any right or benefit guaranteed by USERRA.</P>
              <P>(b) USERRA supersedes any State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by USERRA, including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any USERRA right or the receipt of any USERRA benefit. For example, an employment contract that determines seniority based only on actual days of work in the place of employment would be superseded by USERRA, which requires that seniority credit be given for periods of absence from work due to service in the uniformed services.</P>
              <P>(c) USERRA does not supersede, nullify or diminish any Federal or State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that establishes an employment right or benefit that is more beneficial than, or is in addition to, a right or benefit provided under the Act. For example, although USERRA does not require an employer to pay an employee for time away from work performing service, an employer policy, plan, or practice that provides such a benefit is permissible under USERRA.</P>
              <P>(d) If an employer provides a benefit that exceeds USERRA's requirements in one area, it cannot reduce or limit other rights or benefits provided by USERRA. For example, even though USERRA does not require it, an employer may provide a fixed number of days of paid military leave per year to employees who are members of the National Guard or Reserve. The fact that it provides such a benefit, however, does not permit an employer to refuse to provide an unpaid leave of absence to an employee to perform service in the uniformed services in excess of the number of days of paid military leave.</P>

              <P>(a) In general, if the employee has been absent from a position of civilian employment by reason of service in the uniformed services, he or she will be eligible for reemployment under USERRA by meeting the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The employer had advance notice of the employee's service;</P>
              <P>(2) The employee has five years or less of cumulative service in the uniformed services in his or her employment relationship with a particular employer;</P>

              <P>(b) These general eligibility requirements have important qualifications and exceptions, which are described in detail in §§ 1002.73 through 1002.138. If the employee meets these eligibility criteria, then he or she is eligible for <PRTPAGE P="685"/>reemployment unless the employer establishes one of the defenses described in § 1002.139.

              <P>(b) USERRA applies to foreign employers doing business in the United States.

              <P>(c) An American company operating either directly or through an entity under its control in a foreign country must also comply with USERRA for all its foreign operations, unless compliance would violate the law of the foreign country in which the workplace is located.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is a successor in interest an employer covered by USERRA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>USERRA's definition of “employer” includes a successor in interest. In general, an employer is a successor in interest where there is a substantial continuity in operations, facilities, and workforce from the former employer. The determination whether an employer is a successor in interest must be made on a case-by-case basis using a multi-factor test that considers the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Whether there has been a substantial continuity of business operations from the former to the current employer;</P>
              <P>(b) Whether the current employer uses the same or similar facilities, machinery, equipment, and methods of production;</P>
              <P>(c) Whether there has been a substantial continuity of employees;</P>
              <P>(d) Whether there is a similarity of jobs and working conditions;</P>
              <P>(e) Whether there is a similarity of supervisors or managers; and,</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can one employee be employed in one job by more than one employer?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes. Under USERRA, an employer includes not only the person or entity that pays an employee's salary or wages, but also includes a person or entity that has control over his or her employment opportunities, including a person or entity to whom an employer has delegated the performance of employment-related responsibilities. For example, if the employee is a security guard hired by a security company and he or she is assigned to a work site, the employee may report both to the security company and to the site owner. In such an instance, both employers share responsibility for compliance with USERRA. If the security company declines to assign the employee to a job because of a uniformed service obligation (for example, National Guard duties), then the security company could be in violation of the reemployment requirements and the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA. Similarly, if the employer at the work site causes the employee's removal from the job position because of his or her uniformed service obligations, then the work site employer could be in violation of the reemployment requirements and the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can a hiring hall be an employer?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes. In certain occupations (for example, longshoreman, stagehand, construction worker), the employee may frequently work for many different employers. A hiring hall operated by a union or an employer association typically assigns the employee to the jobs. In these industries, it may not be unusual for the employee to work his or her entire career in a series of short-term job assignments. The definition of “employer” includes a person, institution, organization, or other entity to which the employer has delegated the performance of employment-related responsibilities. A hiring hall therefore is considered the employee's employer if the hiring and job assignment functions have been delegated by an employer to the hiring hall. As the employer, a hiring hall has reemployment responsibilities to its employees. USERRA's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions also apply to the hiring hall.</P>

              <P>Yes. States and their political subdivisions, such as counties, parishes, cities, towns, villages, and school districts, are considered employers under USERRA. The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and territories of the United States, are also considered employers under the Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Does USERRA protect against discrimination in initial hiring decisions?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes. The Act's definition of employer includes a person, institution, organization, or other entity that has denied initial employment to an individual in violation of USERRA's anti-discrimination provisions. An employer need not actually employ an individual to be his or her “employer” under the Act, if it has denied initial employment on the basis of the individual's membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services. Similarly, the employer would be liable if it denied initial employment on the basis of the individual's action taken to enforce a protection afforded to any person under USERRA, his or her testimony or statement in connection with any USERRA proceeding, assistance or other participation in a USERRA investigation, or the exercise of any other right provided by the Act. For example, if the individual has been denied initial employment because of his or her obligations as a member of the National Guard or Reserves, the company or entity denying employment is an employer for purposes of USERRA. Similarly, if an entity withdraws an offer of employment because the individual is called upon to fulfill an obligation in the uniformed services, the entity withdrawing the employment offer is an employer for purposes of USERRA.</P>

              <P>USERRA rights are not diminished because an employee holds a temporary, part-time, probationary, or seasonal employment position. However, an employer is not required to reemploy an employee if the employment he or she left to serve in the uniformed services was for a brief, nonrecurrent period and there is no reasonable expectation that the employment would have continued indefinitely or for a significant period. The employer bears the burden of proving this affirmative defense.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What rights does an employee have under USERRA if he or she is on layoff, on strike, or on a leave of absence?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) If an employee is laid off with recall rights, on strike, or on a leave of absence, he or she is an employee for purposes of USERRA. If the employee is on layoff and begins service in the uniformed services, or is laid off while performing service, he or she may be entitled to reemployment on return if the employer would have recalled the employee to employment during the period of service. Similar principles <PRTPAGE P="687"/>apply if the employee is on strike or on a leave of absence from work when he or she begins a period of service in the uniformed services.</P>
              <P>(b) If the employee is sent a recall notice during a period of service in the uniformed services and cannot resume the position of employment because of the service, he or she still remains an employee for purposes of the Act. Therefore, if the employee is otherwise eligible, he or she is entitled to reemployment following the conclusion of the period of service even if he or she did not respond to the recall notice.</P>
              <P>(c) If the employee is laid off before or during service in the uniformed services, and the employer would not have recalled him or her during that period of service, the employee is not entitled to reemployment following the period of service simply because he or she is a covered employee. Reemployment rights under USERRA cannot put the employee in a better position than if he or she had remained in the civilian employment position.</P>

              <P>(b) In deciding whether an individual is an independent contractor, the following factors need to be considered:</P>
              <P>(1) The extent of the employer's right to control the manner in which the individual's work is to be performed;</P>
              <P>(2) The opportunity for profit or loss that depends upon the individual's managerial skill;</P>
              <P>(3) Any investment in equipment or materials required for the individual's tasks, or his or her employment of helpers;</P>
              <P>(4) Whether the service the individual performs requires a special skill;</P>
              <P>(5) The degree of permanence of the individual's working relationship; and,</P>
              <P>(6) Whether the service the individual performs is an integral part of the employer's business.</P>
              <P>(c) No single one of these factors is controlling, but all are relevant to determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor.</P>

              <P>The National Guard has a dual status. It is a Reserve component of the Army, or, in the case of the Air National Guard, of the Air Force. Simultaneously, it is a State military force subject to call-up by the State Governor for duty not subject to Federal control, such as emergency duty in cases of floods or riots. National Guard members may perform service under either Federal or State authority, but only Federal National Guard service is covered by USERRA.</P>
              <P>(a) National Guard service under Federal authority is protected by USERRA. Service under Federal authority includes active duty performed under Title 10 of the United States Code. Service under Federal authority also includes duty under Title 32 of the United States Code, such as active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty.</P>
              <P>(b) National Guard service under authority of State law is not protected by USERRA. However, many States have laws protecting the civilian job rights of National Guard members who serve under State orders.

              <P>(a) Membership in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) or the Junior ROTC is not “service in the uniformed services.” However, some Reserve and National Guard enlisted members use a college ROTC program as a means of qualifying for commissioned officer status. National Guard and Reserve members in an ROTC program may at times, while participating in that program, be receiving active duty and inactive duty training service credit with their unit. In these cases, participating in ROTC training sessions is considered “service in the uniformed services,” and qualifies a person for protection under USERRA's reemployment and anti-discrimination provisions.</P>

              <P>(b) Typically, an individual in a College ROTC program enters into an agreement with a particular military service that obligates such individual to either complete the ROTC program and accept a commission or, in case he or she does not successfully complete the ROTC program, to serve as an enlisted member. Although an individual does not qualify for reemployment protection, except as specified in (a) above, he or she is protected under <PRTPAGE P="689"/>USERRA's anti-discrimination provisions because, as a result of the agreement, he or she has applied to become a member of the uniformed services and has incurred an obligation to perform future service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Does USERRA cover a member of the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Civil Air Patrol, or the Coast Guard Auxiliary?</SUBJECT>
              <P>No. Although the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a “uniformed service” for some purposes, it is not included in USERRA's definition of this term. Service in the Civil Air Patrol and the Coast Guard Auxiliary similarly is not considered “service in the uniformed services” for purposes of USERRA. Consequently, service performed in the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Civil Air Patrol, and the Coast Guard Auxiliary is not protected by USERRA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Does service in the uniformed services have to be an employee's sole reason for leaving an employment position in order to have USERRA reemployment rights?</SUBJECT>
              <P>No. If absence from a position of employment is necessitated by service in the uniformed services, and the employee otherwise meets the Act's eligibility requirements, he or she has reemployment rights under USERRA, even if the employee uses the absence for other purposes as well. An employee is not required to leave the employment position for the sole purpose of performing service in the uniformed services. For example, if the employee is required to report to an out of State location for military training and he or she spends off-duty time during that assignment moonlighting as a security guard or visiting relatives who live in that State, the employee will not lose reemployment rights simply because he or she used some of the time away from the job to do something other than attend the military training. Also, if an employee receives advance notification of a mobilization order, and leaves his or her employment position in order to prepare for duty, but the mobilization is cancelled, the employee will not lose any reemployment rights.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Must the employee begin service in the uniformed services immediately after leaving his or her employment position in order to have USERRA reemployment rights?</SUBJECT>
              <P>No. At a minimum, an employee must have enough time after leaving the employment position to travel safely to the uniformed service site and arrive fit to perform the service. Depending on the specific circumstances, including the duration of service, the amount of notice received, and the location of the service, additional time to rest, or to arrange affairs and report to duty, may be necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services. The following examples help to explain the issue of the period of time between leaving civilian employment and beginning of service in the uniformed services:</P>
              <P>(a) If the employee performs a full overnight shift for the civilian employer and travels directly from the work site to perform a full day of uniformed service, the employee would not be considered fit to perform the uniformed service. An absence from that work shift is necessitated so that the employee can report for uniformed service fit for duty.</P>
              <P>(b) If the employee is ordered to perform an extended period of service in the uniformed services, he or she may require a reasonable period of time off from the civilian job to put his or her personal affairs in order, before beginning the service. Taking such time off is also necessitated by the uniformed service.</P>
              <P>(c) If the employee leaves a position of employment in order to enlist or otherwise perform service in the uniformed services and, through no fault of his or her own, the beginning date of the service is delayed, this delay does not terminate any reemployment rights.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Must the employee give advance notice to the employer of his or her service in the uniformed services?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Yes. The employee, or an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which his or her service is to be performed, must notify the employer that the employee intends to leave the employment position to perform service in the uniformed services, with certain exceptions described below. In cases in which an employee is employed by more than one employer, the employee, or an appropriate office of the uniformed service in which his or her service is to be performed, must notify each employer that the employee intends to leave the employment position to perform service in the uniformed services, with certain exceptions described below.</P>
              <P>(b) The Department of Defense USERRA regulations at 32 CFR 104.3 provide that an “appropriate officer” can give notice on the employee's behalf. An “appropriate officer” is a commissioned, warrant, or non-commissioned officer authorized to give such notice by the military service concerned.</P>
              <P>(c) The employee's notice to the employer may be either verbal or written. The notice may be informal and does not need to follow any particular format.</P>
              <P>(d) Although USERRA does not specify how far in advance notice must be given to the employer, an employee should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. In regulations promulgated by the Department of Defense under USERRA, 32 CFR 104.6(a)(2)(i)(B), the Defense Department “strongly recommends that advance notice to civilian employers be provided at least 30 days prior to departure for uniformed service when it is feasible to do so.”</P>

              <P>(a) Only a designated authority can make a determination of “military necessity,” and such a determination is not subject to judicial review. Guidelines for defining “military necessity” appear in regulations issued by the Department of Defense at 32 CFR 104.3. In general, these regulations cover situations where a mission, operation, exercise or requirement is classified, or could be compromised or otherwise adversely affected by public knowledge. In certain cases, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, can make a determination that giving of notice by intermittent disaster-response appointees of the National Disaster Medical System is precluded by “military necessity.” See 42 U.S.C. 300hh-11(e)(3)(B).</P>
              <P>(b) It may be impossible or unreasonable to give advance notice under certain circumstances. Such circumstances may include the unavailability of the employee's employer or the employer's representative, or a requirement that the employee report for uniformed service in an extremely short period of time.</P>

Even if the employee tells the employer before entering or completing uniformed service that he or she does not intend to <PRTPAGE P="691"/>seek reemployment after completing the uniformed service, the employee does not forfeit the right to reemployment after completing service.

A period of absence from employment before or after performing service in the uniformed services does not count against the five-year limit. For example, after the employee completes a period of service in the uniformed services, he or she is provided a certain amount of time, depending upon the length of service, to report back to work or submit an application for reemployment. The period between completing the uniformed service and reporting back to work or seeking reemployment does not count against the five-year limit.</P>

When the employee takes a position with a new employer, the five-year period begins again regardless of how much service he or she performed while working in any previous employment relationship.

              <P>(1) Service that is required beyond five years to complete an initial period of obligated service.

The employer cannot refuse to reemploy the employee because it believes that the timing, frequency or duration of the service is unreasonable. However, the employer is permitted to bring its concerns over the timing, frequency, or duration of the employee's service to the attention of the appropriate military authority. Regulations issued by the Department of Defense at 32 CFR 104.4 direct military authorities to provide assistance to an employer in addressing these types of employment issues. The military authorities are required to consider requests from employers of National Guard and Reserve members to adjust scheduled absences from civilian employment to perform service.</P>

Upon completing service in the uniformed services, the employee must notify the pre-service employer of his or her intent to return to the employment position by either reporting to work or submitting a timely application for reemployment.

The employee may seek or obtain employment with an employer other than the pre-service employer during the period of time within which a reemployment application must be made, without giving up reemployment rights with the pre-service employer. However, such alternative employment during the application period should not be of a type that would constitute cause for the employer to discipline or terminate the employee following reemployment.

              <P>Yes. The employer is not permitted to delay or deny reemployment by demanding documentation that does not exist or is not readily available. The employee is not liable for administrative delays in the issuance of military documentation. If the employee is reemployed after an absence from employment for more than 90 days, the employer may require that he or she submit the documentation establishing entitlement to reemployment before treating the employee as not having had a break in service for pension purposes. If the documentation is received after reemployment and it shows that the employee is not entitled to reemployment, the employer may terminate employment and any rights or benefits that the employee may have been granted.</P>

              <P>USERRA does not require any particular form of discharge or separation from service.

              <P>(a) Even if the employee is otherwise eligible for reemployment benefits, the employer is not required to reemploy him or her if the employer establishes that its circumstances have so changed as to make reemployment impossible or unreasonable. For example, an employer may be excused from reemploying the employee where there has been an intervening reduction in force that would have included that employee. The employer may not, however, refuse to reemploy the employee on the basis that another employee was hired to fill the reemployment position during the employee's absence, even if reemployment might require the termination of that replacement employee;</P>
              <P>(b) Even if the employee is otherwise eligible for reemployment benefits, the employer is not required to reemploy him or her if it establishes that assisting the employee in becoming qualified for reemployment would impose an undue hardship, as defined in § 1002.5(n) and discussed in § 1002.198, on the employer; or,</P>
              <P>(c) Even if the employee is otherwise eligible for reemployment benefits, the employer is not required to reemploy him or her if it establishes that the employment position vacated by the employee in order to perform service in the uniformed services was for a brief, nonrecurrent period and there was no reasonable expectation that the employment would continue indefinitely or for a significant period.</P>
              <P>(d) The employer defenses included in this section are affirmative ones, and the employer carries the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that any one or more of these defenses is applicable.</P>

              <P>During a period of service in the uniformed services, the employee is deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence from the civilian employer. In this status, the employee is entitled to the non-seniority rights and benefits generally provided by the employer to other employees with similar seniority, status, and pay that are on furlough or leave of absence. Entitlement to these non-seniority rights and benefits is not dependent on how the employer characterizes the employee's status during a period of service. For example, if the employer characterizes the employee as “terminated” during the period of uniformed service, this characterization cannot be used to avoid USERRA's requirement that the employee be deemed on furlough or leave of absence, and therefore entitled to the non-seniority rights and benefits generally provided to employees on furlough or leave of absence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Which non-seniority rights and benefits is the employee entitled to during a period of service?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The non-seniority rights and benefits to which an employee is entitled during a period of service are those that the employer provides to similarly situated employees by an employment contract, agreement, policy, practice, or plan in effect at the employee's workplace. These rights and benefits include those in effect at the beginning of the employee's employment and those established after employment began. They also include those rights and benefits that become effective during the employee's period of service and that are provided to similarly situated employees on furlough or leave of absence.</P>

              <P>(b) If the non-seniority benefits to which employees on furlough or leave <PRTPAGE P="697"/>of absence are entitled vary according to the type of leave, the employee must be given the most favorable treatment accorded to any comparable form of leave when he or she performs service in the uniformed services. In order to determine whether any two types of leave are comparable, the duration of the leave may be the most significant factor to compare. For instance, a two-day funeral leave will not be “comparable” to an extended leave for service in the uniformed service. In addition to comparing the duration of the absences, other factors such as the purpose of the leave and the ability of the employee to choose when to take the leave should also be considered.</P>
              <P>(c) As a general matter, accrual of vacation leave is considered to be a non-seniority benefit that must be provided by an employer to an employee on a military leave of absence only if the employer provides that benefit to similarly situated employees on comparable leaves of absence.</P>

              <P>If employment is interrupted by a period of service in the uniformed services and the employee knowingly provides written notice of intent not to return to the position of employment after service in the uniformed services, he or she is not entitled to those non-seniority rights and benefits.

              <P>(a) If employment is interrupted by a period of service, the employee must be permitted upon request to use any accrued vacation, annual, or similar leave with pay during the period of service, in order to continue his or her civilian pay. However, the employee is not entitled to use sick leave that accrued with the civilian employer during a period of service in the uniformed services, unless the employer allows employees to use sick leave for any reason, or allows other similarly situated employees on comparable furlough or leave of absence to use accrued paid sick leave. Sick leave is usually not comparable to annual or vacation leave; it is generally intended to provide income when the employee or a family member is ill and the employee is unable to work.</P>

              <P>If the employee has coverage under a health plan in connection with his or her employment, the plan must permit the employee to elect to continue the coverage for a certain period of time as described below:</P>
              <P>(a) When the employee is performing service in the uniformed services, he or she is entitled to continuing coverage for himself or herself (and dependents if the plan offers dependent coverage) under a health plan provided in connection with the employment. The plan must allow the employee to elect to continue coverage for a period of time that is the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) The 24-month period beginning on the date on which the employee's absence for the purpose of performing service begins; or,</P>
              <P>(2) The period beginning on the date on which the employee's absence for the purpose of performing service begins, and ending on the date on which he or she fails to return from service or apply for a position of employment as provided under sections 1002.115-123 of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) USERRA does not require the employer to establish a health plan if there is no health plan coverage in connection with the employment, or, where there is a plan, to provide any particular type of coverage.</P>
              <P>(c) USERRA does not require the employer to permit the employee to initiate new health plan coverage at the beginning of a period of service if he or she did not previously have such coverage.</P>

              <P>USERRA does not specify requirements for electing continuing coverage. Health plan administrators may develop reasonable requirements addressing how continuing coverage may be elected, consistent with the terms of the plan and the Act's exceptions to the requirement that the employee give advance notice of service in the uniformed services. For example, the employee cannot be precluded from electing continuing health plan coverage under circumstances where it is impossible or unreasonable for him or her to make a timely election of coverage.</P>

              <P>(a) If the employee performs service in the uniformed service for fewer than 31 days, he or she cannot be required to pay more than the regular employee share, if any, for health plan coverage.</P>
              <P>(b) If the employee performs service in the uniformed service for 31 or more days, he or she may be required to pay no more than 102% of the full premium under the plan, which represents the employer's share plus the employee's share, plus 2% for administrative costs.</P>
              <P>(c) USERRA does not specify requirements for methods of paying for continuing coverage. Health plan administrators may develop reasonable procedures for payment, consistent with the terms of the plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What actions may a plan administrator take if the employee does not elect or pay for continuing coverage in a timely manner?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The actions a plan administrator may take regarding the provision or cancellation of an employee's continuing coverage depend on whether the employee is excused from the requirement to give advance notice, whether the plan has established reasonable rules for election of continuation coverage, and whether the plan has established reasonable rules for the payment for continuation coverage.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">No notice of service and no election of continuation coverage:</E> If an employer <PRTPAGE P="699"/>provides employment-based health coverage to an employee who leaves employment for uniformed service without giving advance notice of service, the plan administrator may cancel the employee's health plan coverage upon the employee's departure from employment for uniformed service. However, in cases in which an employee's failure to give advance notice of service was excused under the statute because it was impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity, the plan administrator must reinstate the employee's health coverage retroactively upon his or her election to continue coverage and payment of all unpaid amounts due, and the employee must incur no administrative reinstatement costs. In order to qualify for an exception to the requirement of timely election of continuing health care, an employee must first be excused from giving notice of service under the statute.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of service but no election of continuing coverage:</E> Plan administrators may develop reasonable requirements addressing how continuing coverage may be elected. Where health plans are also covered under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, 26 U.S.C. 4980B (COBRA), it may be reasonable for a health plan administrator to adopt COBRA-compliant rules regarding election of continuing coverage, as long as those rules do not conflict with any provision of USERRA or this rule. If an employer provides employment-based health coverage to an employee who leaves employment for uniformed service for a period of service in excess of 30 days after having given advance notice of service but without making an election regarding continuing coverage, the plan administrator may cancel the employee's health plan coverage upon the employee's departure from employment for uniformed service, but must reinstate coverage without the imposition of administrative reinstatement costs under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) Plan administrators who have developed reasonable rules regarding the period within which an employee may elect continuing coverage must permit retroactive reinstatement of uninterrupted coverage to the date of departure if the employee elects continuing coverage and pays all unpaid amounts due within the periods established by the plan;</P>
              <P>(2) In cases in which plan administrators have not developed rules regarding the period within which an employee may elect continuing coverage, the plan must permit retroactive reinstatement of uninterrupted coverage to the date of departure upon the employee's election and payment of all unpaid amounts at any time during the period established in section 1002.164(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Election of continuation coverage without timely payment:</E> Health plan administrators may adopt reasonable rules allowing cancellation of coverage if timely payment is not made. Where health plans are covered under COBRA, it may be reasonable for a health plan administrator to adopt COBRA-compliant rules regarding payment for continuing coverage, as long as those rules do not conflict with any provision of USERRA or this rule.</P>

An exclusion or waiting period may not be imposed in connection with the reinstatement of coverage upon reemployment, if an exclusion or waiting period would not have been imposed had coverage not been terminated by reason of such service.</P>

              <P>(b) USERRA permits a health plan to impose an exclusion or waiting period as to illnesses or injuries determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, performance of service in the uniformed services. The determination that the employee's illness or injury was incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of service may only be made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his or her representative.

              <SUBJECT>How does the continuation of health plan benefits apply to a multiemployer plan that provides health plan coverage through a health benefits account system?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Some employees receive health plan benefits provided pursuant to a multiemployer plan that utilizes a health benefits account system in which an employee accumulates prospective health benefit eligibility, also commonly referred to as “dollar bank,” “credit bank,” and “hour bank” plans. In such cases, where an employee with a positive health benefits account balance elects to continue the coverage, the employee may further elect either option below:</P>
              <P>(1) The employee may expend his or her health account balance during an absence from employment due to service in the uniformed services in lieu of paying for the continuation of coverage as set out in § 1002.166. If an employee's health account balance becomes depleted during the applicable period provided for in § 1002.164(a), the employee must be permitted, at his or her option, to continue coverage pursuant to § 1002.166. Upon reemployment, the plan must provide for immediate reinstatement of the employee as required by § 1002.168, but may require the employee to pay the cost of the coverage until the employee earns the credits necessary to sustain continued coverage in the plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The employee may pay for continuation coverage as set out in § 1002.166, in order to maintain intact his or her account balance as of the beginning date of the absence from employment due to service in the uniformed services. This option permits the employee to resume usage of the account balance upon reemployment.</P>
              <P>(b) Employers or plan administrators providing such plans should counsel employees of their options set out in this subsection.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How is “prompt reemployment” defined?</SUBJECT>
              <P>“Prompt reemployment” means as soon as practicable under the circumstances of each case. Absent unusual circumstances, reemployment must occur within two weeks of the employee's application for reemployment. For example, prompt reinstatement after a weekend National Guard duty generally means the next regularly scheduled working day. On the other hand, prompt reinstatement following several years of active duty may require more time, because the employer may have to reassign or give notice to another employee who occupied the returning employee's position.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What position is the employee entitled to upon reemployment?</SUBJECT>
              <P>As a general rule, the employee is entitled to reemployment in the job position that he or she would have attained with reasonable certainty if not for the absence due to uniformed service. This position is known as the escalator position. The principle behind the escalator position is that, if not for the period of uniformed service, the employee could have been promoted (or, alternatively, demoted, transferred, or laid off) due to intervening events. The escalator principle requires that the employee be reemployed in a position that reflects with reasonable certainty the pay, benefits, seniority, and other job perquisites, that he or she would have attained if not for the period of service. Depending upon the specific circumstances, the employer may have the option, or be required, to reemploy the employee in a position other than the escalator position.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How is the specific reemployment position determined?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In all cases, the starting point for determining the proper reemployment position is the escalator position, which is the job position that the employee would have attained if his or her continuous employment had not been interrupted due to uniformed service. Once this position is determined, the employer may have to consider several factors before determining the appropriate reemployment position in any particular case. Such factors may include the employee's length of service, qualifications, and disability, if any. The reemployment position may be either the escalator position; the pre-service position; a position comparable to the escalator or pre-service position; or, the nearest approximation to one of these positions.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1002.193</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Does the reemployment position include elements such as seniority, status, and rate of pay?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Yes. The reemployment position includes the seniority, status, and rate of pay that an employee would ordinarily have attained in that position given his or her job history, including prospects for future earnings and advancement. The employer must determine the seniority rights, status, and rate of pay as though the employee had been continuously employed during the period of service. The seniority rights, status, and pay of an employment position include those established (or changed) by a collective bargaining agreement, employer policy, or employment practice. The sources of seniority rights, status, and pay include agreements, policies, and practices in effect at the beginning of the employee's service, and any changes that may have occurred during the period of service. In particular, the employee's status in the reemployment position could include opportunities for advancement, general working conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank, responsibility, and geographical location.</P>

              <P>(b) If an opportunity for promotion, or eligibility for promotion, that the employee missed during service is based on a skills test or examination, then the employer should give him or her a reasonable amount of time to adjust to the employment position and then give a skills test or examination. No fixed amount of time for permitting adjustment to reemployment will be deemed reasonable in all cases. However, in determining a reasonable amount of time to permit an employee to adjust to reemployment before scheduling a makeup test or examination, an employer may take into account a variety of factors, including but not limited to the length of time the returning employee was absent from work, the level of difficulty of the test itself, the typical time necessary to prepare or study for the test, the duties and responsibilities of the reemployment position and the promotional position, and the nature and responsibilities of the service member while serving in the uniformed service. If the employee is successful on the makeup exam and, based on the results of that exam, there is a reasonable certainty that he or she would have been promoted, or made eligible for promotion, during the time that the employee served in the uniformed service, then <PRTPAGE P="702"/>the promotion or eligibility for promotion must be made effective as of the date it would have occurred had employment not been interrupted by uniformed service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can the application of the escalator principle result in adverse consequences when the employee is reemployed?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes. The Act does not prohibit lawful adverse job consequences that result from the employee's restoration on the seniority ladder. Depending on the circumstances, the escalator principle may cause an employee to be reemployed in a higher or lower position, laid off, or even terminated. For example, if an employee's seniority or job classification would have resulted in the employee being laid off during the period of service, and the layoff continued after the date of reemployment, reemployment would reinstate the employee to layoff status. Similarly, the status of the reemployment position requires the employer to assess what would have happened to such factors as the employee's opportunities for advancement, working conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank, responsibility, and geographical location, if he or she had remained continuously employed. The reemployment position may involve transfer to another shift or location, more or less strenuous working conditions, or changed opportunities for advancement, depending upon the application of the escalator principle.</P>

              <P>(a) The length of the employee's most recent period of uniformed service;</P>

              <P>The employee must be qualified for the reemployment position. The employer must make reasonable efforts to help the employee become qualified to perform the duties of this position. The employer is not required to reemploy the employee on his or her return from service if he or she cannot, after reasonable efforts by the employer, qualify for the appropriate reemployment position.</P>
              <P>(a)(1) “Qualified” means that the employee has the ability to perform the essential tasks of the position. The employee's inability to perform one or more non-essential tasks of a position does not make him or her unqualified.</P>
              <P>(2) Whether a task is essential depends on several factors, and these factors include but are not limited to:</P>

              <P>(ii) Written job descriptions developed before the hiring process begins;</P>

              <SUBJECT>What seniority rights does an employee have when reemployed following a period of uniformed service?</SUBJECT>

              <P>The employee is entitled to the seniority and seniority-based rights and benefits that he or she had on the date the uniformed service began, plus any seniority and seniority-based rights and benefits that the employee would have attained if he or she had remained continuously employed. In determining entitlement to seniority and seniority-based rights and benefits, the period of absence from employment due to or necessitated by uniformed service is not considered a break in employment. The rights and benefits protected by USERRA upon reemployment include those provided by the employer and those required by statute. For example, <PRTPAGE P="704"/>under USERRA, a reemployed service member would be eligible for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. 2601-2654 (FMLA), if the number of months and the number of hours of work for which the service member was employed by the civilian employer, together with the number of months and the number of hours of work for which the service member would have been employed by the civilian employer during the period of uniformed service, meet FMLA's eligibility requirements. In the event that a service member is denied FMLA leave for failing to satisfy the FMLA's hours of work requirement due to absence from employment necessitated by uniformed service, the service member may have a cause of action under USERRA but not under the FMLA.</P>

              <P>No. USERRA does not require the employer to adopt a formal seniority system. USERRA defines seniority as longevity in employment together with any employment benefits that accrue with, or are determined by, longevity in employment. In the absence of a formal seniority system, such as one established through collective bargaining, USERRA looks to the custom and practice in the place of employment to determine the employee's entitlement to any employment benefits that accrue with, or are determined by, longevity in employment.</P>

              <P>A seniority-based right or benefit is one that accrues with, or is determined by, longevity in employment. Generally, whether a right or benefit is seniority-based depends on three factors:</P>
              <P>(a) Whether the right or benefit is a reward for length of service rather than a form of short-term compensation for work performed;</P>
              <P>(b) Whether it is reasonably certain that the employee would have received the right or benefit if he or she had remained continuously employed during the period of service; and,</P>
              <P>(c) Whether it is the employer's actual custom or practice to provide or withhold the right or benefit as a reward for length of service.

              <P>A reasonable certainty is a high probability that the employee would have received the seniority or seniority-based right or benefit if he or she had been continuously employed. The employee does not have to establish that he or she would have received the benefit as an absolute certainty. The employee can demonstrate a reasonable certainty that he or she would have received the seniority right or benefit by showing that other employees with seniority similar to that which the employee would have had if he or she had remained continuously employed received the right or benefit.

              <P>The employee's rate of pay is determined by applying the same escalator principles that are used to determine the reemployment position, as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) If the employee is reemployed in the escalator position, the employer must compensate him or her at the rate of pay associated with the escalator position. The rate of pay must be determined by taking into account any pay increases, differentials, step increases, merit increases, or periodic increases that the employee would have attained with reasonable certainty had he or she remained continuously employed during the period of service. In addition, when considering whether merit or performance increases would have been attained with reasonable certainty, an employer may examine the returning employee's own work history, his or her history of merit increases, and the work and pay history of employees in the same or similar position. For example, if the employee missed a merit pay increase while performing service, but qualified for previous merit pay increases, then the rate of pay should include the merit pay increase that was missed. If the merit pay increase that the employee missed during service is based on a skills test or examination, then the employer should give the employee a reasonable amount of time to adjust to the reemployment position and then give him or her the skills test or examination. No fixed amount of time for permitting adjustment to reemployment will be deemed reasonable in all cases. However, in determining a reasonable amount of time to permit an employee to adjust to reemployment before scheduling a makeup test or examination, an employer may take into account a variety of factors, including but not limited to the length of time the returning employee was absent from work, the level of difficulty of the test itself, the typical time necessary to prepare or study for the test, the duties and responsibilities of the reemployment position and the promotional position, and the nature and responsibilities of the service member while serving in the uniformed service. The escalator principle also applies in the event a pay reduction occurred in the reemployment position during the period of service. Any pay adjustment must be made effective as of the date it would have occurred had the employee's employment not been interrupted by uniformed service.</P>

              <P>(b) If the employee is reemployed in the pre-service position or another position, the employer must compensate <PRTPAGE P="706"/>him or her at the rate of pay associated with the position in which he or she is reemployed. As with the escalator position, the rate of pay must be determined by taking into account any pay increases, differentials, step increases, merit increases, or periodic increases that the employee would have attained with reasonable certainty had he or she remained continuously employed during the period of service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Who is responsible for funding any plan obligation to provide the employee with pension benefits?</SUBJECT>
              <P>With the exception of multiemployer plans, which have separate rules discussed below, the employer is liable to the pension benefit plan to fund any obligation of the plan to provide benefits that are attributable to the employee's period of service. In the case of a defined contribution plan, once the employee is reemployed, the employer must allocate the amount of its make-up contribution for the employee, if any; his or her make-up employee contributions, if any; and his or her elective deferrals, if any; in the same manner and to the same extent that it allocates the amounts for other employees during the period of service. In the case of a defined benefit plan, the employee's accrued benefit will be increased for the period of service once he or she is reemployed and, if applicable, has repaid any amounts previously paid to him or her from the plan and made any employee contributions that may be required to be made under the plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When is the employer required to make the plan contribution that is attributable to the employee's period of uniformed service?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The employer is not required to make its contribution until the employee is reemployed. For employer contributions to a plan in which the employee is not required or permitted to contribute, the employer must make the contribution attributable to the employee's period of service no later than ninety days after the date of reemployment, or when plan contributions are normally due for the year in which the service in the uniformed services was performed, whichever is later. If it is impossible or unreasonable for the employer to make the contribution within this time period, the employer must make the contribution as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(b) If the employee is enrolled in a contributory plan he or she is allowed (but not required) to make up his or her missed contributions or elective deferrals. These makeup contributions or elective deferrals must be made during a time period starting with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the employee's immediate past period of uniformed service, with the repayment period not to exceed five years. Makeup contributions or elective deferrals may only be made during this period and while the employee is employed with the post-service employer.</P>
              <P>(c) If the employee's plan is contributory and he or she does not make up his or her contributions or elective deferrals, he or she will not receive the employer match or the accrued benefit attributable to his or her contribution because the employer is required to make contributions that are contingent on or attributable to the employee's contributions or elective deferrals only to the extent that the employee makes up his or her payments to the plan. Any employer contributions that are contingent on or attributable to the employee's make-up contributions or elective deferrals must be made according to the plan's requirements for employer matching contributions.</P>
              <P>(d) The employee is not required to make up the full amount of employee contributions or elective deferrals that he or she missed making during the period of service. If the employee does not make up all of the missed contributions or elective deferrals, his or her pension may be less than if he or she had done so.</P>
              <P>(e) Any vested accrued benefit in the pension plan that the employee was entitled to prior to the period of uniformed service remains intact whether or not he or she chooses to be reemployed under the Act after leaving the uniformed service.</P>
              <P>(f) An adjustment will be made to the amount of employee contributions or elective deferrals the employee will be able to make to the pension plan for any employee contributions or elective deferrals he or she actually made to the plan during the period of service.</P>

              <P>No. The employee is not required or permitted to make up a missed contribution in an amount that exceeds the amount he or she would have been permitted or required to contribute had he or she remained continuously employed during the period of service.</P>

              <P>Yes, provided the plan is a defined benefit plan. If the employee received a distribution of all or part of the accrued benefit from a defined benefit plan in connection with his or her service in the uniformed services before he or she became reemployed, he or she must be allowed to repay the withdrawn amounts when he or she is reemployed. The amount the employee must repay includes any interest that would have accrued had the monies not been withdrawn. The employee must be allowed to repay these amounts during a time period starting with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the employee's immediate past period of uniformed service, with the repayment period not to exceed five years (or such longer time as may be agreed to between the employer and the employee), provided the employee is employed with the post-service employer during this period.</P>

              <P>The amount of the employee's pension benefit depends on the type of pension plan.</P>
              <P>(a) In a non-contributory defined benefit plan, where the amount of the pension benefit is determined according to a specific formula, the employee's benefit will be the same as though he or she had remained continuously employed during the period of service.</P>
              <P>(b) In a contributory defined benefit plan, the employee will need to make up contributions in order to have the same benefit as if he or she had remained continuously employed during the period of service.</P>
              <P>(c) In a defined contribution plan, the benefit may not be the same as if the employee had remained continuously employed, even though the employee and the employer make up any contributions or elective deferrals attributable to the period of service, because the employee is not entitled to forfeitures and earnings or required to experience losses that accrued during the period or periods of service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the obligations of a multiemployer pension benefit plan under USERRA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>A multiemployer pension benefit plan is one to which more than one employer is required to contribute, and which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between one or more employee organizations and more than one employer. The Act uses ERISA's definition of a multiemployer plan. In addition to the provisions of USERRA that apply to all pension benefit plans, there are provisions that apply specifically to multiemployer plans, as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) The last employer that employed the employee before the period of service is responsible for making the employer contribution to the multiemployer plan, if the plan sponsor does not provide otherwise. If the last employer is no longer functional, the plan must nevertheless provide coverage to the employee.</P>
              <P>(b) An employer that contributes to a multiemployer plan and that reemploys the employee pursuant to USERRA must provide written notice of reemployment to the plan administrator within 30 days after the date of reemployment. The returning service member should notify the reemploying employer that he or she has been reemployed pursuant to USERRA. The 30-day period within which the reemploying employer must provide written notice to the multiemployer plan pursuant to this subsection does not begin until the employer has knowledge that the employee was reemployed pursuant to USERRA.</P>

              <P>(c) The employee is entitled to the same employer contribution whether <PRTPAGE P="709"/>he or she is reemployed by the pre-service employer or by a different employer contributing to the same multiemployer plan, provided that the pre-service employer and the post-service employer share a common means or practice of hiring the employee, such as common participation in a union hiring hall.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How is compensation during the period of service calculated in order to determine the employee's pension benefits, if benefits are based on compensation?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In many pension benefit plans, the employee's compensation determines the amount of his or her contribution or the retirement benefit to which he or she is entitled.</P>
              <P>(a) Where the employee's rate of compensation must be calculated to determine pension entitlement, the calculation must be made using the rate of pay that the employee would have received but for the period of uniformed service.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Where the rate of pay the employee would have received is not reasonably certain, such as where compensation is based on commissions earned, the average rate of compensation during the 12-month period prior to the period of uniformed service must be used.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the rate of pay the employee would have received is not reasonably certain and he or she was employed for less than 12 months prior to the period of uniformed service, the average rate of compensation must be derived from this shorter period of employment that preceded service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is there a statute of limitations in an action under USERRA?</SUBJECT>

              <P>USERRA does not have a statute of limitations, and it expressly precludes the application of any State statute of limitations. At least one court, however, has held that the four-year general Federal statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 1658, applies to actions under USERRA. <E T="03">Rogers</E> v. <E T="03">City of San Antonio,</E> 2003 WL 1566502 (W.D. Texas), <E T="03">reversed on other grounds,</E> 392 F.3d 758 (5th Cir. 2004). But see <E T="03">Akhdary</E> v. <E T="03">City of Chattanooga,</E> 2002 WL 32060140 (E.D. Tenn.). In addition, if an individual unreasonably delays asserting his or her rights, and that unreasonable delay causes prejudice to the employer, the courts have recognized the availability of the equitable doctrine of <E T="03">laches</E> to bar a claim under USERRA. Accordingly, individuals asserting rights under USERRA should determine whether the issue of the applicability of the Federal statute of limitations has been resolved and, in any event, act promptly to preserve their rights under USERRA.</P>

              <P>(a) The court may require the employer to comply with the provisions of the Act;</P>

              <P>(d) Any wages, benefits, or liquidated damages awarded under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are in addition to, and must not diminish, any of the other rights and benefits provided by USERRA (such as, for example, the right to be employed or reemployed by the employer).</P>

              <P>Yes. In an action brought in the name of the United States, for which the relief includes compensation for lost wages, benefits, or liquidated damages, the compensation must be held in a special deposit account and must be paid, on order of the Attorney General, directly to the person. If the compensation is not paid to the individual because of the Federal Government's inability to do so within a period of three years, the compensation must be converted into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is priority of service?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As defined in section 2(a) of the JVA (38 U.S.C. 4215(a)) “priority of service” means, with respect to any qualified job training program, that a covered person shall be given priority over a non-covered person for the receipt of employment, training, and placement services provided under that program, notwithstanding any other provision of the law.</P>
            <P>(b) Priority in the context of providing priority of service to veterans and other covered persons in qualified job training programs covered by this regulation means the right to take precedence over non-covered persons in obtaining services. Depending on the type of service or resource being provided, taking precedence may mean:</P>
            <P>(1) The covered person receives access to the service or resource earlier in time than the non-covered person; or</P>
            <P>(2) If the service or resource is limited, the covered person receives access to the service or resource instead of or before the non-covered person.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1010.210</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>In which Department job training programs do covered persons receive priority of service?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Priority of service applies to every qualified job training program funded, in whole or in part, by the Department, including:</P>
            <P>(1) Any such program or service that uses technology to assist individuals to access workforce development programs (such as job and training opportunities, labor market information, career assessment tools, and related support services); and</P>
            <P>(2) Any such program or service under the public employment service system, One-Stop Career Centers, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, a demonstration or other temporary program; any workforce development program targeted to specific groups; and those programs implemented by States or local service providers based on Federal block grants administered by the Department.</P>

            <P>(b) The implementation of priority of service does not change the intended <PRTPAGE P="715"/>function of a program or service. Covered persons must meet all statutory eligibility and program requirements for participation in order to receive priority for a program or service.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1010.220</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How are recipients required to implement priority of service?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An agreement to implement priority of service, as described in these regulations and in any departmental guidance, is a condition for receipt of all Department job training program funds.</P>
            <P>(b) All recipients are required to ensure that priority of service is applied by all sub-recipients of Department funds. All program activities, including those obtained through requests for proposals, solicitations for grant awards, sub-grants, contracts, sub-contracts, and (where feasible) memoranda of understanding or other service provision agreements, issued or executed by qualified job training program operators, must be administered in compliance with priority of service.</P>

            <SUBJECT>In addition to the responsibilities of all recipients, do States and political subdivisions of States have any particular responsibilities in implementing priority of service?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Pursuant to their responsibility under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, States are required to address priority of service in their comprehensive strategic plan for the State's workforce investment system. Specifically, States must develop policies for the delivery of priority of service by the State Workforce Agency or Agencies, Local Workforce Investment Boards, and One-Stop Career Centers for all qualified job training programs delivered through the State's workforce system. The policy or policies must require that processes are in place to ensure that covered persons are identified at the point of entry and given an opportunity to take full advantage of priority of service. These processes shall be undertaken to ensure that covered persons are aware of:</P>
            <P>(1) Their entitlement to priority of service;</P>
            <P>(2) The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and</P>
            <P>(3) Any applicable eligibility requirements for those programs and/or services.</P>
            <P>(b) The State's policy or policies must require Local Workforce Investment Boards to develop and include in their strategic local plan, policies implementing priority of service for the local One-Stop Career Centers and for service delivery by local workforce preparation and training providers. These policies must establish processes to ensure that covered persons are identified at the point of entry so that covered persons are able to take full advantage of priority of service. These processes shall ensure that covered persons are aware of:</P>
            <P>(1) Their entitlement to priority of service;</P>
            <P>(2) The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and</P>

            <P>(a) The Department will monitor recipients of funds for qualified job training programs to ensure that covered persons are made aware of and afforded priority of service.</P>
            <P>(b) Monitoring priority of service will be performed jointly between the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) and the DOL agency responsible for the program's administration and oversight.</P>
            <P>(c) A recipient's failure to provide priority of service to covered persons will be handled in accordance with the program's established compliance review processes. In addition to the remedies available under the program's compliance review processes, a recipient may be required to submit a corrective action plan to correct such failure.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1010.300</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What processes are to be implemented to identify covered persons?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Recipients of funds for qualified job training programs must implement processes to identify covered persons who physically access service delivery points or who access virtual service delivery programs or Web sites in order to provide covered persons with timely and useful information on priority of service at the point of entry. Point of entry may include reception through a One-Stop Career Center established pursuant to the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as part of an application process for a specific program, or through any other method by which covered persons express an interest in receiving services, either in-person or virtually.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The processes for identifying covered persons at the point of entry must be designed to:</P>
            <P>(i) Permit the individual to make known his or her covered person status; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Permit those qualified job training programs specified in § 1010.330(a)(2) to initiate data collection for covered entrants.</P>
            <P>(2) The processes for identifying covered persons are not required to verify the status of an individual as a veteran or eligible spouse at the point of entry unless they immediately undergo eligibility determination and enrollment in a program.</P>
            <P>(c) The processes for identifying covered persons must ensure that:</P>
            <P>(1) Covered persons are identified at the point of entry to allow covered persons to take full advantage of priority of service; and</P>
            <P>(2) Covered persons are to be made aware of:</P>
            <P>(i) Their entitlement to priority of service;</P>
            <P>(ii) The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>How will priority of service be applied?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Recipients of funds for qualified job training programs must implement processes in accordance with § 1010.300 to identify covered persons at the point of entry, whether in person or virtual, so the covered person can be notified of their eligibility for priority of service. Since qualified job training programs may offer various types of services including staff-assisted services as well as self-services or informational activities, recipients also must ensure that priority of service is implemented throughout the full array of services provided to covered persons by the qualified job training program.</P>
            <P>(b) Three categories of qualified job training programs affect the application of priority of service: universal access, discretionary targeting and statutory targeting. To obtain priority, a covered person must meet the statutory eligibility requirement(s) applicable to the specific program from which services are sought. For those programs that also have discretionary or statutory priorities or preferences pursuant to a Federal statute or regulation, recipients must coordinate providing priority of service with applying those other priorities, as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Universal access programs</E> operate or deliver services to the public as a whole; they do not target specific groups. These programs are required to provide priority of service to covered persons.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Discretionary targeting programs</E> focus on a particular group, or make efforts to provide a certain level of service to such a group, but do not specifically mandate that the favored group be served before other eligible individuals. Whether these provisions are found in a Federal statute or regulation, priority of service will apply. Covered persons must receive the highest priority for the program or service, and non-covered persons within the discretionary targeting will receive priority over non-covered persons outside the discretionary targeting.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Statutory targeting programs</E> are programs derived from a Federal statutory mandate that requires a priority <PRTPAGE P="717"/>or preference for a particular group of individuals or requires spending a certain portion of program funds on a particular group of persons receiving services. These are mandatory priorities. Recipients must determine each individual's covered person status and apply priority of service as described below:</P>
            <P>(i) Covered persons who meet the mandatory priorities or spending requirement or limitation must receive the highest priority for the program or service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Non-covered persons within the program's mandatory priority or spending requirement or limitation, must receive priority for the program or service over covered persons outside the program-specific mandatory priority or spending requirement or limitation; and,</P>
            <P>(iii) Covered persons outside the program-specific mandatory priority or spending requirement or limitation must receive priority for the program or service over non-covered persons outside the program-specific mandatory priority or spending requirement or limitation.</P>

            <P>Yes. Every recipient of funds for qualified job training programs must collect such information, maintain such records, and submit reports containing such information and in such formats as the Secretary may require related to the provision of priority of service.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> Recipients must collect information in accordance with instructions issued by the Department.</P>
            <P>(1) Recipients must collect two broad categories of information:</P>
            <P>(i) For the qualified job training programs specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, information must be collected on covered persons from the point of entry, as defined in § 1010.300(a), and as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; and,</P>
            <P>(ii) For all qualified job training programs, including the programs specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, information must be collected on covered and non-covered persons who receive services, as prescribed by the respective qualified job training programs, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, qualified job training programs that served, at the national level, 1,000 or more veterans per year for the three most recent years of program operations (currently the Wagner-Peyser, WIA Adult, WIA Dislocated Worker, WIA National Emergency Grant, and Senior Community Service Employment Programs) must collect information and report on covered entrants.

            <SUBJECT>Is there an exemption for certain large employers from the dedicated human resources professional criterion for the large employer platinum HIRE Vets Medallion Award?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes. Large employers who employ 5,000 or fewer employees need not have a dedicated human resources professional to support the hiring and retention of veteran employees. A large employer with 5,000 or fewer employees can satisfy the criterion at § 1011.100(b)(7) by employing at least one human resources professional whose regular work duties include supporting the hiring, training, and retention of veteran employees.</P>
