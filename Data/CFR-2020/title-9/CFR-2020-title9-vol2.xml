      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements and procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Every person operating or desiring to operate as a market agency or dealer as defined in section 301 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 201) must apply for registration. To apply, such persons must file a properly executed application for registration on a form furnished by the Agency. Each applicant must file an application for registration with the regional office for the region where the applicant has his or her primary place of business, and file and maintain a bond as required in §§ 201.27 through 201.34 (9 CFR 201.27 through 201.34).</P>
            <P>(b) If, upon review of an application, the Administrator has reason to believe the applicant is unfit to engage in the activity for which application has been made, a proceeding shall be instituted promptly affording the applicant the opportunity for a full hearing, in accordance with the Department's Rule of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings (7 CFR Subpart H), to show cause why the application for registration should not be denied. If after the hearing the application is denied, as soon as the issue(s) that formed the basis of the denial have been remedied, the applicant may file a new application for registration.</P>
            <P>(c) Any person regularly employed on salary, or other comparable method of compensation, by a packer to buy livestock for such packer is subject to the regulation requirements of this section. Such person must be registered as a dealer to purchase livestock for slaughter on behalf of the packer.</P>
            <P>(d) Every person clearing or desiring to clear the buying operations of other registrants must apply for registration as a market agency providing clearing services by filing a properly executed application on a form furnished by the Agency, and file and maintain a bond as required in §§ 201.27 through 201.34.</P>

            <P>(e) If an application for registration is granted, a market agency or dealer receives an acceptance letter from the Agency that issues the registration number and the effective date of the registration. Each registration issued in accordance with this section will not expire, provided that the registrant timely files its annual report with the <PRTPAGE P="8"/>Agency as required in section 201.97. Failure of a registrant to file an annual report by the date required in section 201.97 will result in the issuance of a default notice. Thirty days after receipt of the default notice, the registration will expire if the Agency does not receive an annual report from the registrant. A registrant who fails to renew its registration in a timely manner, and continues to operate, will be engaged in business subject to the Act without a valid registration in violation of section 303 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 203).</P>
            <P>(f) Registrations that expire during a period of suspension imposed as a result of an order or injunction may be renewed, but the renewal will not be effective until the specified suspension period terminates.</P>

The schedules, supplements and amendments must be conspicuously posted for public inspection at the stockyard, and filed with the regional supervisor, at least 10 days before their effective dates, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Each schedule, supplement and amendment shall set forth its effective date, a description of the stockyard services rendered, the stockyard at which it applies, the name and address of the stockyard owner or market agency, the kind of livestock covered by it, and any rules or regulations which affect any rate or charge contained therein.

A schedule of the current feed charges based on average feed cost and showing the effective date shall be conspicuously posted at the stockyard at all times. Changes in feed charges may become effective 2 days after the change is posted at the stockyard.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Professional veterinary services.</E> The 10-day filing and notice provision contained in section 306(a) of the Act is waived for a schedule of charges for professional veterinary services. A schedule of charges for professional veterinary services rendered by a veterinarian at a posted stockyard shall be conspicuously posted at the stockyard at all times. The schedule of charges and any supplement or amendment thereto may become effective 2 days after the schedule, supplement, or amendment is posted at the stockyard.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Joint schedules.</E> If the same schedule is to be observed by more than one market agency operating at any one stockyard, one schedule will suffice for such market agencies. The names and business addresses of those market <PRTPAGE P="9"/>agencies adhering to such schedule must appear on the schedule.</P>

            <P>(a) Every market agency, packer, and dealer, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, and except packer buyers registered as dealers to purchase livestock for slaughter only, shall execute and maintain a reasonable bond on forms approved by the Administrator containing the appropriate condition clauses, as set forth in § 201.31 of the regulations, applicable to the activity or activities in which the person or persons propose to engage, to secure the performance of obligations <PRTPAGE P="10"/>incurred by such market agency, packer, or dealer. No market agency, packer, or dealer required to maintain a bond shall conduct his operations unless there is on file and in effect a bond complying with the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Every market agency buying on a commission basis and every dealer buying for his own account or for the accounts of others shall file and maintain a bond. If a registrant operates as both a market agency buying on a commission basis and as a dealer, only one bond to cover both buying operations need be filed. Any person operating as a market agency selling on a commission basis and as a market agency buying on a commission basis or as a dealer shall file and maintain separate bonds to cover his selling and buying operations.</P>
            <P>(c) Each market agency and dealer whose buying operations are cleared by another market agency shall be named as clearee in the bond filed and maintained by the market agency registered to provide clearing services. Each market agency selling livestock on a commission basis shall file and maintain its own bond.</P>
            <P>(d) Every packer purchasing livestock, directly or through an affiliate or employee or a wholly-owned subsidiary, except those packers whose annual purchases do not exceed $500,000, shall file and maintain a reasonable bond. In the event a packer maintains a wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate to conduct its livestock buying, the wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate shall be registered as a packer buyer for its parent packer firm, and the required bond shall be maintained by the parent packer firm.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Market agency selling livestock on commission.</E> To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the dollar value of livestock sold during the preceding business year, or the substantial part of that business year, in which the market agency did business, by the actual number of days on which livestock was sold. The divisor (the number of days on which livestock was sold) shall not exceed 130. The amount of bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $50,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $50,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $50,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage for a market agency selling on commission be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Market agency buying on commission or dealer.</E> The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by the dealer or market agency during a period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased during the preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in which the dealer or market agency or both did business, by one-half the number of days on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of the bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $75,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $75,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $75,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Market agency acting as clearing agency.</E> The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by all persons for whom the market agency served as a clearor during a period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased by all persons for whom the market agency served as a clearor during the preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in which the market agency acting as <PRTPAGE P="11"/>clearing agency did business, by one-half the number of days on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation exceeds $75,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $75,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $75,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage be less than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Packer.</E> The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by the packer during a period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased during the preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in which the packer did business, by one-half the number of days on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of the bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage for a packer be less than $10,000.</P>
            <P>(e) If a person applying for registration as a market agency or dealer has been engaged in the business of handling livestock before the date of the application, the value of the livestock handled, if representative of future operations, must be used in computing the required amount of bond coverage. If the applicant for registration is a successor in business to a registrant formerly subject to these regulations, the amount of bond coverage of the applicant must be at least that amount required of the prior registrant, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator. If a packer becomes subject to these regulations, the value of livestock purchased, if representative of future operations, must be used in computing the required amount of bond coverage. If a packer is a successor in business to a packer formerly subject to these regulations, the amount of bond coverage of the successor must be at least that amount required of the prior packer, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(f) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that a bond is inadequate to secure the performance of the obligations of the market agency, dealer or packer covered thereby, the Administrator shall notify such person to adjust the bond to meet the requirements the Administrator determines to be reasonable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements regarding scale tickets evidencing weighing of livestock, live poultry, and feed.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When livestock, poultry or feed is weighed for the purpose of purchase, sale, acquisition, or settlement, a scale ticket must be issued which must be serially numbered and used in numerical sequence. Sufficient copies must be executed and provided to all parties to the transaction. Unused and partially executed scale tickets must not be left exposed or accessible to other parties and, except in feed mills, must be kept under lock when the weigher is not at the scale. In instances where the weight values are automatically recorded directly on the account of purchase, account of sale, or other basic transaction record, this record may serve in place of a scale ticket.</P>

In instances where the weight values are automatically recorded directly on the account of purchase, account of sale, or other basic transaction record, this record may serve in place of a scale ticket. Scale tickets or other basic transaction records issued under this section must show:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and location of the agency performing the weighing service;</P>
            <P>(2) The date of the weighing;</P>

            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever livestock or live poultry is bought, sold, acquired, paid, or settled on a weight basis, or whenever the weight of feed is a factor in determining payment or settlement to a livestock grower or poultry grower by a stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, or live poultry dealer when livestock or poultry is produced under a growing arrangement, payment or settlement shall be on the basis of the actual weight of the livestock, live poultry, and/or feed shown on the scale ticket. If the actual weight used is not obtained on the date and at the place of transfer of possession, this information shall be disclosed with the date and location of the weighing on the accountings, bills, or statements issued. Any adjustment to the actual weight shall be fully and accurately explained on the accountings, bills, or statements issued, and records shall be maintained to support such adjustment.</P>

            <P>(b) Whenever the weight of feed is a factor in determining payment or settlement to such livestock grower or poultry grower when the livestock or poultry is produced under a livestock or poultry growing arrangement, any feed that is picked up from or returned by a livestock grower or poultry grower must be weighed or its weight must be reasonably determined. When feed is picked up or returned and not weighed, the stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, or live poultry dealer must document that the method used reasonably determines weight and is mutually acceptable to it and the livestock grower or poultry grower. The stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, or live poultry dealer must <PRTPAGE P="18"/>document and account for the picked up or returned feed weight.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Instructions for weighing livestock.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Stockyard operators, market agencies, dealers, and packers who operate scales on which livestock is weighed in purchase or sales transactions are responsible for the accurate weighing of such livestock. They shall supply copies of the instructions in this section to all persons who perform weighing operations for them and direct such person to familiarize themselves with the instructions and to comply with them at all times. This section shall also apply to any additional weighers who are employed at any time. Weighers must acknowledge their receipt of these instructions and agree to comply with them, by signing in duplicate, P&amp;SA Form 215 provided by the Packers and Stockyards Programs. One copy of the form is to be filed with a regional office of the Packers and Stockyards Programs and the other retained by the agency employing the weighers.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Balancing the empty scale.</E> (1) The empty scale shall be balanced each day before weighing begins, and maintained in correct balance which weighing operations continue. The zero balance shall be verified at intervals of not more than 15 drafts or 15 minutes, whichever is completed first. In addition, the zero balance of the scale shall be verified whenever a weigher resumes weighing duties after an absence from the scale and also whenever a load exceeding half the scale capacity or 10,000 pounds (whichever is less) has been weighed and is followed by a load of less than 1,000 pounds, verification to occur before the weighing of the load of less than 1,000 pounds.</P>
            <P>(2) The time at which the empty scale is balanced or its zero balance verified shall be recorded on scale tickets or other permanent records. Balance tickets must be filed with other scale tickets issued on that date.</P>
            <P>(3) Before balancing the empty scale, the weigher shall assure himself that the scale gates are closed and that no persons or animals are on the scale platform or in contact with the stock rack, gates, or platform. If the scale is balanced with persons on the scale platform, the zero balance shall be verified whenever there is a change in such persons. When the scale is properly balanced and ready for weighing, the weigher shall so indicate by an appropriate signal.</P>
            <P>(4) Weighbeam scales shall be balanced by first seating each poise securely in its zero notch and then moving the balance ball to such position that a correct zero balance is obtained. A scale equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced when the pointer comes to rest at zero. A scale not equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced if the weighbeam, when released at the top or bottom of the trig loop, swings freely in the trig loop in such manner that it will come to rest at the center of the trig loop.</P>
            <P>(5) Dial scales shall be balanced by releasing all drop weights and operating the balance ball or other balancing device to obtain a correct zero balance. The indicator must visually indicate zero on the dial and the ticket printer must record a correct zero balance.</P>
            <P>(6) Electronic digital scales should be properly warmed up before use. In most cases, it is advisable to leave the electric power on continuously. The zero load balance shall be verified by recording the zero balance on a scale ticket. The main indicating element and the remote visual weight display shall indicate zero when the balance is verified. The proper procedure for balancing this type of scale will vary according to the manufacturer. Refer to the operator's manual for specific instructions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Weighing the load.</E> (1) Before weighing a draft of livestock, the weigher shall assure himself that the entire draft is on the scale platform with the gates closed and that no persons or animals off the scale are in contact with the platform, gates, or stock rack.</P>
            <P>(i) On a weighbeam scale with a balance indicator, the weight of a draft shall be determined by seating the poises at such positions that the pointer will come to rest within the central target area or within <FR>1/4</FR> (0.25) inch of the zero mark.</P>

            <P>(ii) On a weighbeam scale without a balance indicator, the weight shall be determined by seating the poises at such positions that the weighbeam, <PRTPAGE P="22"/>when released from the top or bottom of the trig loop, will swing freely and come to rest at the approximate center of the trig loop.</P>
            <P>(iii) On a dial scale, the weight is indicated automatically when the indicator moves around the dial face and comes to rest.</P>
            <P>(iv) On an electronic digital scale, the weight of a draft is indicated automatically when the weight value indicated stabilized.</P>
            <P>(2) The correct weight of a livestock draft is the value in pounds indicated when a correct load balance is obtained. The weigher should always concentrate his attention upon the beam tip, balance indicator or dial indicator while weighing and not concern himself with reading the visible weight indications until correct load balance is obtained. On electronic digital scales, the weigher should concentrate on the pulsing or flickering of weight values to assure that the unit indicates a stable weight before activating the print button.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Recording the weight.</E> (1) The weight of each draft shall be recorded immediately after the load balance is obtained and before any poises are moved or the load is removed from the scale platform. The weigher shall make certain that the printed weight record agrees with the weight value visually indicated when correct load balance is obtained. He shall also assure himself that the printed weight value is distinct and legible.</P>
            <P>(2) The weight printing device on a scale shall be operated only to produce a printed or impressed record of the weight value while the livestock load is on the scale and correctly balanced. If the weight value is not printed clearly and correctly, the ticket shall be marked void and a new one printed before the livestock is removed from the scale.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Scale tickets.</E> (1) Scale tickets used to record the weight values of livestock in purchase or sales transactions shall be used, at any given scale, in the order of their consecutive serial numbers unless otherwise marked to show the order of their use. All tickets shall show the date of the weighing and the name or initials of the weigher performing the weighing service.</P>
            <P>(2) No scale tickets shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of because they are soiled, damaged, incorrectly executed, or voided. They shall be preserved and filed to comprise a complete serial number sequence.</P>
            <P>(3) No scale ticket shall be used to record the weight of a livestock draft for “catch-weight,” inventory, transportation charge or other nonsale purposes unless the ticket is clearly marked to show why the weight was determined.</P>
            <P>(4) When weight values are recorded by means of automatic recording equipment directly on the accounts of sale or other basic records, such record may serve in lieu of a scale ticket.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Weigher's responsibilities.</E> (1) The primary responsibility of a weigher is to determine and accurately record the weight of livestock drafts without prejudice or favor to any person or agency and without regard for livestock ownership, price, condition, fill, shrink, or other considerations. A weigher shall not permit the representations or attitudes of any persons or agencies to influence his judgment or action in performing his duties.</P>
            <P>(2) Unused scale tickets, or those which are partially executed but without a printed weight value, shall not be left exposed or accessible to unauthorized personnel. All such tickets shall be kept under lock when the weigher is not at his duty station.</P>
            <P>(3) Accurate weighing and correct weight recording require that a weigher shall not permit his operations to be hurried to the extent that inaccurate weights or incorrect weight records may result. Each draft of livestock must be weighed accurately to the nearest minimum weight value that can be indicated or recorded. Manual operations connected with balancing, weighing, and recording shall be performed with the care necessary to prevent damage to the accurately machined and adjusted parts of weighbeams, poises, and printing devices.</P>

            <P>(4) Livestock owners, buyers, or others having legitimate interest in a livestock draft must be permitted to observe the balancing, weighing, and recording procedures, and a weigher shall not deny them that right or withhold <PRTPAGE P="23"/>from them any information pertaining to the weight of that draft. He shall check the zero balance of the scale or reweigh a draft of livestock when requested by such parties.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Sensitivity control.</E> (1) A scale must be sensitive in response to platform loading if it is to yield accurate weights. It, therefore, is the duty of a weigher to assure himself that interferences, weighbeam friction, or other factors do not impair sensitivity. He should satisfy himself, at least twice each day, that the scale is sufficiently sensitive, and if the following requirements are not met, he should report the facts to his superior or employer immediately.</P>
            <P>(2) A weighbeam scale with a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the pointer at the center of the target, movement of the fractional poise one graduation will change the indicator rest point <FR>1/4</FR> inch (0.25) or the width of the central target area, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>(3) A weighbeam scale without a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the weighbeam at the center of the trig loop, movement of the fractional poise two graduations will cause the weighbeam to come to rest at the bottom of the trig loop.</P>
            <P>(4) Adjustable damping devices are incorporated in balance indicators and in dial scales to absorb the effects of load impact and assist in bringing the indicator to rest. The weigher should be familiar with the location and adjustment of these damping devices and should keep them adjusted so that the pointer will oscillate freely through at least one complete cycle of movement before coming to rest at its original position.</P>
            <P>(5) Friction at weighbeam bearings may reduce the sensitivity of the scale, cause sluggish weighbeam action and affect weighing accuracy. A weigher should inspect the weighbeam assembly daily to make certain that there is clearance between the weighbeam and the pivot bearings.</P>
            <P>(6) Interferences or binding of the scale platform, stock rack, gates or other “live” parts of the scale are common causes of weighing inaccuracy. A weigher should satisfy himself, at the beginning of each weighing period, that all such “live” parts have sufficient clearance to prevent interferences.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">General precautions.</E> (1) The poises of weighbeam scales are carefully adjusted and sealed to a definite weight at the factory and any change in that weight seriously affects weighing accuracy. A weigher, therefore, should be certain that poise parts do not become broken, loose or lost and that no material is added to a poise. Balancing or weighing shall not be performed while a scale ticket is in the slot of a weighbeam poise.</P>
            <P>(2) Stops are provided on scale weighbeams to prevent movement of poises back of the zero graduation when balancing or weighing. When the stops become worn or broken and allow a poise to be set behind the zero position, this condition should be reported and corrected without delay.</P>
            <P>(3) Foreign objects or loose material in the form of nuts, bolts, washers or other material on any part of the weighbeam assembly, including the counter-balance hanger or counter-balance weights, are potential sources of weighing error. Loose balancing material must be enclosed in the shot cup of the counter-balance hanger, and counter-balance weights must not be of the slotted type which can readily be removed.</P>
            <P>(4) Whenever for any reason a weigher has reason to believe that a scale is not functioning properly or not yielding correct weight values, he shall discontinue weighing, report the facts to the parties responsible for scale maintenance, and request inspection, test, or repair of the scale.</P>
            <P>(5) When a scale has been adjusted, modified, or repaired in any manner which may affect the accuracy of weighing or weight recording, the weigher shall not use the scale until it has been tested and inspected and found to be accurate.</P>

            <P>(6) Count-off men, gate men, or others assigned to open or close scale gates or to drive livestock on or off the scale, shall perform those functions as directed by the weigher's signals or spoken instructions. They shall prevent persons or animals off the scale from being in contact with any part of <PRTPAGE P="24"/>the scale platform, stock rack, or gates while the scale is being balanced or used for weighing. They shall not open gates or remove livestock from the scale until directed by the weigher.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Instructions for weighing live poultry or feed.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Live poultry dealers who operate scales on which live poultry or feed is weighed for purposes of purchase, sale, acquisition, or settlement are responsible for the accurate weighing of such poultry or feed. They shall supply copies of the instructions in this section to all persons who perform weighing operations for them and direct such persons to familiarize themselves with the instructions and to comply with them at all times. This section shall also apply to any additional weighers who are employed at any time. Weighers must acknowledge their receipt of these instructions and agree to comply with them by signing in duplicate, a form provided by the Packers and Stockyards Division, Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. One copy of this form is to be filed with a regional office of the Packers and Stockyards Division, Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration and the other copy retained by the Agency employing the weighers. The following instructions shall be applicable to the weighing of live poultry on all scales, except that paragraph (c)(1) of this section is only applicable to the weighing of live poultry on vehicle scales.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Balancing the empty scale.</E> (1) The scale must be maintained in zero balance at all times. The empty scale must be balanced each day before weighing begins and thereafter the scale must be balanced; and the zero balance, the time and date the empty <PRTPAGE P="29"/>scale was balanced must be mechanically printed on the scale ticket or other basic transaction record before any poultry or feed is weighed. In addition, the zero balance of the scale must be verified whenever a weigher resumes weighing duties after an absence from the scale.</P>
            <P>(2) Before balancing the empty scale, the weigher shall notify parties outside the scale house of his/her intention and shall be assured that no persons or vehicles are in contact with the platform. When the empty scale is balanced and ready for weighing, the weigher shall so indicate by appropriate signal.</P>
            <P>(3) Weighbeam scales shall be balanced by first seating each poise securely in its zero notch and then moving the balance ball to such position that a correct zero balance is obtained. A scale equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced when the indicator comes to rest in the center of the target area. A scale not equipped with a balance indicator is correctly balanced if the weighbeam, when released at the top or bottom of the trig loop, swings freely in the trig loop in such manner that it will come to rest at the center of the trig loop.</P>
            <P>(4) Dial scales shall be balanced by releasing all drop weights and operating the balance ball or other balancing device to obtain a correct zero balance. The indicator must visibly indicate zero on the dial reading face and the ticket printer must record a correct zero balance. “Balance tickets” shall be filed with other scale tickets issued on that date.</P>
            <P>(5) Electronic digital scales should be properly warmed up before use. In most cases it is advisable to leave the electric power on continuously. The zero balance shall be verified by recording the zero balance on a scale ticket. The main indicating element and the remote visual weight display shall indicate zero when the balance is verified. The proper procedure for balancing this type of scale will vary according to the manufacturer. Refer to the operator's manual for specific instructions.</P>
            <P>(6) A balance ball or other balancing device shall be operated only when balancing the empty scale and shall not be operated at any time or for any other purpose.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Sensitivity control.</E> (1) A scale must be sensitive in response to platform loading if it is to yield accurate weights. It, therefore, is the duty of a weigher to assure himself that interferences, weighbeam friction, or other factors do not impair sensitivity. He shall satisfy himself, at least twice each day, that the scale is sufficiently sensitive, and, if the following requirements are not met, he must report the facts to his superior or employer immediately.</P>
            <P>(2) A weighbeam scale with a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the indicator at the center of the target, movement of the fractional poise one graduation will change the indicator rest point (<FR>1/4</FR>) inch (0.25) or the width of the central target area, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>(3) A weighbeam scale without a balance indicator is sufficiently sensitive if, when the scale is balanced with the weighbeam at the center of the trig loop, movement of the fractional poise two graduations will cause the weighbeam to come to rest at the bottom of the trig loop.</P>
            <P>(4) Adjustable damping devices are incorporated in balance indicators and in dial scales to absorb the effects of load impact and to bring the indicator to rest. The weigher must be familiar with the location and adjustment of these damping devices and keep them so adjusted that when the indicator is displaced from a position of rest, it will oscillate freely through at least one complete cycle of movement before coming to rest at its original position.</P>
            <P>(5) Friction at weighbeam bearings may reduce the sensitiveness of the scale, cause sluggish weighbeam action and affect weighing accuracy. A weigher must inspect the weighbeam assembly daily to make certain that there is clearance between the weighbeam and the pivot bearings.</P>

            <P>(6) Interferences or binding of the scale platform, or other “live” parts of the scale, are common causes of weighing inaccuracy. A weigher shall satisfy himself, at the beginning of each weighing period, that all such “live” parts have sufficient clearance to prevent interference.<PRTPAGE P="30"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Weighing the load.</E> (1) Vehicle scales used to weigh live poultry shall be of sufficient length and capacity to weigh an entire vehicle as a unit; provided, that a trailer may be uncoupled from a tractor and weighed as a single unit. Before weighing a vehicle, either coupled or uncoupled, the weigher shall be assured that the entire vehicle is on the scale platform and that no persons are on the scale platform.</P>
            <P>(i) On a weighbeam scale with a balance indicator the weight of a vehicle shall be determined by moving the poises to such positions that the indicator will come to rest within the central target area.</P>
            <P>(ii) On a weighbeam scale without a balance indicator the weight shall be determined by moving the poises to such positions that the weighbeam, when released from the top or bottom of the trig loop, will swing freely in the trig loop and come to rest at the approximate center of the trig loop.</P>
            <P>(iii) On a dial scale the weight of a vehicle is indicated automatically when the indicator revolves around the dial face and comes to rest.</P>
            <P>(iv) On an electronic digital scale the weight of a vehicle is indicated automatically when the weight value indicated is stable.</P>
            <P>(v) A feed hopper attached to an electronic digital scale must be empty of feed and the electronic digital scale must be balanced at zero prior to first weighment for each grower or per truckload, whichever is applicable. The date and time that the empty hopper scale is balanced with proof of the zero balance must be mechanically printed on the scale ticket or other permanent record that must be attached to the grower's copy of the scale ticket.</P>
            <P>(vi) An onboard weighing system must be level and locked in position and zero balanced prior to weighing. The date and time the onboard scale is balanced with proof of the zero balance must be mechanically printed on the scale ticket or other permanent record that must be attached to the grower's copy of the scale ticket. When more than one grower's feed is weighed, the preceding grower's gross weight can be used for the next grower's tare weight, and can be repeated until the unit is full.</P>
            <P>(2) The correct weight is the value in pounds indicated by a weighbeam, dial or digital scale when a stable load balance is obtained. In any case, the weigher should concentrate on the beam tip, balance indicator, dial or digital indicator while weighing and not be concerned with reading the visible weight indications until a stable load balance is obtained. On electronic digital scales, the weigher should concentrate on the pulsing or flickering of weight values to assure that the unit indicates a stable weight before activating the print button.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Recording the weight.</E> (1) The gross or tare weight shall be recorded immediately after the load balance is obtained and before any poises are moved or load removed from the scale platform. The weigher shall make certain that the printed weight record agrees with the weight value visibly indicated on the weighbeam, dial or digital indicator when correct load balance is obtained. The weigher shall also assure that the printed weight value is sufficiently distinct and legible.</P>
            <P>(2) The weight printing device on a scale shall be operated only to produce a printed or impressed record of the weight while the load is on the scale and correctly balanced. If the weight is not printed clearly and correctly, the ticket shall be marked void and a new one printed before the load is removed from the scale.</P>
            <P>(3) When returned feed from a contract poultry grower is picked up and weighed on an onboard weighing system, the weight of the feed must be recorded and a ticket printed. That weight must be used as the tare weight when feed from another contract poultry grower is picked up on the same load. The procedure must be followed each time another grower's feed is added to the load.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Weigher's responsibilities.</E> (1) The primary responsibility of a weigher is to determine and record the true weight of live poultry without prejudice or favor to any person or agency and without regard for poultry ownership, price, condition, shrink, or other considerations. A weigher shall not permit the representations or attitudes of any persons or agencies to influence <PRTPAGE P="31"/>their judgment or action in performing his/her duties.</P>
            <P>(2) Accurate weighing and weight recording require that a weigher shall not permit operations to be hurried to the extent that inaccurate weights or incorrect weight records may result. The gross, tare and net weights must be determined accurately to the nearest minimum graduation. Manual operations connected with balancing, weighing, and recording shall be performed with the care necessary to prevent damage to the accurately machined and adjusted parts of weighbeams, poises, and printing devices. Rough handling of these parts shall be avoided.</P>
            <P>(3) Poultry growers, live poultry dealers, sellers, or others having legitimate interest in a load of poultry are entitled to observe the balancing, weighing, and recording procedures. A weigher shall not deny such persons that right or withhold from them any information pertaining to the weight. The weigher shall check the zero balance of the scale or reweigh a load of poultry when requested by such parties or duly authorized representatives of the administrator.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">General precautions.</E> (1) The poises of weighbeam scales are carefully adjusted and sealed to a definite weight at the factory and any change in that weight seriously affects weighing accuracy. A weigher, therefore, shall observe if poise parts are broken, loose or lost or if material is added to a poise and shall report any such condition to his/her superior or employer. Balancing or weighing shall not be performed while a scale ticket is in the slot of a weighbeam poise.</P>
            <P>(2) Stops are provided on scale weighbeams to prevent movement of poises back of the zero graduation when balancing or weighing. When the stops become worn or broken and allow a poise to be set behind the zero position, this condition must be reported by the weigher to their superior or employer and corrected without delay.</P>
            <P>(3) Motion detection circuits are a part of electronic scales. They are designed to prevent the printing of weight values if the load has not stabilized within prescribed limits. The weighmaster's duty is to print the actual weight of the load within these limits. This requires printing the actual weight of the load, not one of the other weights that may be within the motion detection limits.</P>
            <P>(4) Foreign objects or loose material in the form of nuts, bolts, washers, or other material on any part of the weighbeam assembly, including the counter-balance hanger or counter-balance weights, are potential sources of weighing error. Loose balancing material must be enclosed in the shot cup of the counter-balance hanger and counter-balance weights must not be of the slotted type which can readily be removed.</P>
            <P>(5) Whenever, for any reason, a weigher has reason to believe that a scale is not functioning properly or not yielding correct weight values, the weigher shall discontinue weighing, report the facts to the parties responsible for scale maintenance and request inspection, test or repair of the scale.</P>
            <P>(6) When a scale has been adjusted, modified, or repaired in any manner which can affect the accuracy of weighing or weight recording, the weigher shall not use the scale until it has been tested and inspected and found to be accurate.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 202.103</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Rule 3: Beginning a reparation proceeding.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing.</E> A reparation proceeding is begun by filing a complaint. Any interested person (including any agency of a state or territory having jurisdiction <PRTPAGE P="37"/>over persons subject to the Act in such state or territory) desiring to complain of anything done or omitted to be done by any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer in violation of sections 304, 305, 306, or 307, or of an order of the Secretary made under title III, of the Act, may file a complaint to begin a reparation proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form.</E> The complaint must be in writing, state the facts of the matter complained of, identify each person complained against (respondent), and identify each person who complains against such respondent and claims reparation from such respondent. It may be on a printed form supplied by the Agency, or may be a formal document, or may be a letter, mailgram, or telegram. It may be typewritten or handwritten. If it is not on a printed form supplied by the Agency, the Agency Head may, prior to docketing of the proceeding, recommend to the complainant that an amended complaint be filed on such a printed form.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents and attachments.</E> So far as practicable, the complaint should include the following items as applicable:</P>
            <P>(1) Date and place where the alleged violation occurred;</P>
            <P>(2) Quantity and quality of the livestock involved;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether a sale is involved and, if so, the date, sale price, and amount actually paid and received;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether a consignment is involved and, if so the date, reported proceeds, gross, net;</P>
            <P>(5) Amount of reparation claimed, and method of computation;</P>
            <P>(6) Name and address of each partner or member, if a partnership or joint venture is involved;</P>
            <P>(7) Name and address of each person involved, including any agent representing the complainant or the respondent in the transaction involved;</P>
            <P>(8) Other material facts, including terms of contract; and</P>
            <P>(9) True copies of all available papers relating to the transaction complained about, including shipping documents, letters, telegrams, invoices, manifests, accounts of sales, and special contracts or agreements, and checks and drafts. If it appears that any such item has been omitted from the complaint, the Agency Head may, prior to docketing of the proceeding, recommend to the complainant that such item be supplied by written amendment to the complaint.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Where to file.</E> The complaint should be transmitted or delivered to any regional office of the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD), or to the PSD headquarters in Washington, DC, or delivered to any full time PSD employee.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Time for filing.</E> The complaint must be received by the Department within 90 days after accrual of the cause of action alleged in it. If a complaint is transmitted or delivered to an office of the Department, it shall be deemed to be received by the Department when it reaches such office. If a complaint is delivered to a full-time PSD employee, it shall be deemed to be received by the Department when it is received by such employee.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Amendment.</E> The complaint may be amended at any time prior to the close of an oral hearing or the filing of the last evidence in a written hearing, except that:</P>
            <P>(1) An amendment cannot add a respondent if it is filed more than 90 days after accrual of the cause of action against such respondent;</P>
            <P>(2) An amendment cannot state a new and different cause of action if it is filed more than 90 days after accrual of such new and different cause of action; and</P>
            <P>(3) After the first amendment, or after the filing of an answer by the respondent, an amendment may not be filed without the written consent of the respondent, or leave of the presiding officer, or, prior to docketing of the proceeding, leave of the Agency Head. Any such amendment must be filed in writing and signed by the complainant or the attorney or representative of the complainant. If any such amendment is filed before the initial service of the complaint on the respondent, it shall be served on the respondent only if the complaint is served as provided in Rule 4(b), § 202.104(b). If any such amendment is filed after such service, it shall be served on the respondent in any case.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Withdrawal.</E> At any time, a complainant may withdraw a complaint <PRTPAGE P="38"/>filed by or on behalf of the same complainant, thus terminating the reparation proceeding on such complaint unless a counterclaim or another complaint is pending therein. If a complainant fails to cooperate with the Secretary in the disposition of the matter complained of, such complainant may be presumed to desire to withdraw the complaint filed by or on behalf of such complainant, after service on the parties of written notice of the facts of such failure and reasonable opportunity for such complainant to state whether such presumption is correct.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Informal disposition.</E> If there appears to be any reasonable ground for doing so, the Agency Head shall investigate the matter complained of. If the Agency Head reasonably believes that there are not sufficient facts to form the basis for further proceeding, the matter may be dropped, without prejudice to subsequent court action on the same cause of action; if it is dropped, the person filing the complaint shall be informed. If the statements in the complaint, and information obtained in the investigation, seem to warrant such action, the Agency Head may make an effort to obtain the consent of the parties to an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter by communication with the parties or their attorneys or representatives.

Any cross-claim asserted against a co-respondent, based on a violation for which the act authorizes reparation to be ordered to be paid, and filed within 90 days after accrual of the cause of action alleged therein, shall be served on such person as a complaint; within 20 days after such service, such person shall file an answer thereto in compliance with the above requirements for an answer to a complaint.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to file.</E> If a respondent fails to file an answer as required above, such persons shall be deemed to have admitted all the allegations of the complaint or cross-claim against such person, and to have consented to the issuance of a final order in the proceeding, based on all evidence in the record. For this purpose, the evidence in the record may include information contained in a report of investigation made a part of the record pursuant to rule 4(c), § 202.104(c), and evidence received in a hearing, oral or written, held subsequent to the expiration of the time for filing such answer, but shall not be limited to such information and evidence.

            <SUBJECT>Rule 9: Depositions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> Any party may file an application for an order for the taking of testimony by deposition, at any time after docketing of a proceeding and before the close of an oral hearing or the filing of such party's evidence in a written hearing therein. The application shall set forth: (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and address of the person (referred to in this section as the “officer”) before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the reasons why such deposition should be taken, which must show that it may be able to be used as set forth in paragraph (i) of this section; (4) whether the proposed examination is to be on interrogatories or oral; and (5) if oral, a suggested time and place where the proposed deposition is to be made and a suggested manner in which the proposed deposition is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or by personal attendance of the individuals who are expected to participate in the deposition). The application for an order for the taking of testimony by deposition shall be made in writing, unless it is made orally on the record at an oral hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response; service.</E> If any such application is made orally on the record at an oral hearing, each party other than the applicant, present at such hearing, may respond to it orally. If any such application is in writing it shall be served on each party other than the applicant, and each such other party shall have not less than 20 days, from the date of service on such party of the application, to file a written response to it.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Written questions (interrogatories).</E> (1) If the examination will be oral, parties who will not be present or represented at it may file written questions with the officer prior to the time of the examination.</P>
            <P>(2) The presiding officer may direct, or the parties may agree, that the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions. If the presiding officer finds, upon the protest of a party to the proceeding, that such party has a principal place of business or residence more than 100 miles from the place of the examination and that it would constitute an undue hardship on such party to be present or represented at an oral examination at such place, the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions. In any such case, the presiding officer shall state on the record at the oral hearing that, or shall serve the parties with notice that, the deposition, if taken, shall be taken by means of written questions.</P>
            <P>(3) If the examination is conducted by means of written questions, copies of the applicant's questions must be received by the other party to the proceeding and the officer at least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise agreed, and any cross questions of a party other than the applicant must be received by the applicant and the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Order.</E> (1) The presiding officer, if satisfied that good cause for taking the <PRTPAGE P="42"/>deposition is present, may order the taking of the deposition.</P>
            <P>(2) The order shall be served on the parties and shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) The name and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be made;</P>
            <P>(ii) The name of the deponent;</P>
            <P>(iii) Whether the deposition will be oral or on written questions;</P>
            <P>(iv) If the deposition is oral, the manner in which the deposition is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition); and</P>
            <P>(v) The time, which shall not be less than 20 days after the issuance of the order, and place.</P>
            <P>(3) The officer, time, place, and manner of the deposition as stated in the presiding officer's order need not be the same as the officer, time, place, and manner suggested in the application.</P>
            <P>(4) The deposition shall be conducted in the manner (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition) agreed to by the parties.</P>
            <P>(5) If the parties cannot agree on the manner in which the deposition is to be conducted:</P>
            <P>(i) The deposition shall be conducted by telephone unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the deposition by audio-visual telecommunication:</P>
            <P>(A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or</P>
            <P>(C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the deposition is not conducted by telephone, the deposition shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the deposition by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the deposition:</P>
            <P>(A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or</P>
            <P>(C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone or audio-visual telecommunication.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Qualifications of officer.</E> No deposition shall be made except before an officer authorized by the law of the United States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or before an officer authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths, or before the presiding officer. No deposition shall be made before an officer who is a relative (within the third degree by blood or marriage), employee, attorney, or representative of any party (or an employee of an attorney or representative of any party), or who is financially interested in the result of the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedure on examination.</E> The deponent shall be examined under oath or affirmation, and the testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the officer, or by some person under the direction and in the presence of the officer. If the examination is on interrogatories, they shall be propounded by the officer. If the examination is oral, the deponent shall be examined first by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken, or the representative of such party, and shall be subject to cross-examination by any other party or the representative thereof who is present at the examination; the officer shall propound any interrogatories filed with the officer by parties not present or represented at the examination.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Certification and filing by officer.</E> The officer shall certify on the transcript or recording that the deponent was duly sworn by the officer and that the transcript or recording is a true record of the deponent's testimony, with such exceptions as the certificate shall specify. The officer shall then securely seal the transcript or recording, together with three copies of the transcript or recording, with an extra copy for each party in excess of two, in an envelope, and mail the same by registered or certified mail to the presiding officer.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Service; correction.</E> After the transcript or recording is received by the presiding officer, it shall promptly be served on all parties. Any party, within 20 days after such service, may file a <PRTPAGE P="43"/>written motion proposing corrections to the transcript or recording. Any such motion shall be served on each party other than the one filing it, who shall have 10 days to file a written response to it. Any such response shall be served on each party other than the one filing it. Such documents, if filed, shall be a part of the record of the proceeding if any portion of the transcript or recording is made a part of the record. All portions of the transcript or recording which are not referred to in any such motion shall be presumed to be accurate except for obvious typographical errors.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Use.</E> If a written hearing is held, a transcript or recording, of a deposition ordered and taken in accord with this section, may be made a part of the record as evidence by any party, by written motion filed with such party's evidence. If an oral hearing is held, except as otherwise provided in these rules, such a transcript or recording may be made a part of the record as evidence, on written motion filed by any party, or oral motion of any party made at the oral hearing, if no party objects after reasonable notice and opportunity to do so, or if the presiding officer finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and:</P>
            <P>(1) That the witness is dead;</P>
            <P>(2) That the witness is unable to attend or testify for any good reason including age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</P>
            <P>(3) That the party offering the transcript or recording has tried without success to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</P>
            <P>(4) That such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony orally before the presiding officer, to allow the transcript or recording to be used.</P>
            <FP>If any portion of a transcript or recording of a deposition is made a part of the record as evidence on motion of any party, any other party may make a part of the record as evidence the remainder, or any other portion, of the transcript or recording.</FP>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Expenses.</E> Fees and reimbursements payable to an officer taking a deposition, or other person recording the testimony in the deposition, shall be paid by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Subpoenas.</E> No subpoena can issue, to compel attendance, testimony, or production of documentary evidence, at an examination under this rule 9.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Agreement of parties.</E> In any case, any transcript or recording of any deposition, or any part of such a transcript or recording, may be made a part of the record as evidence by agreement of the parties other than a party failing to file an answer as required in these rules.</P>

            <P>(3) Less than $10,000 is in controversy and the presiding officer determines, upon written request by any party thereto, that an oral hearing is necessary to establish the facts and circumstances giving rise to the controversy. The hearing shall be written if not oral.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Withdrawal of request.</E> If $10,000 or more is in controversy and a party has timely filed a request for oral hearing, such party may withdraw such request at any time prior to completion of an oral hearing. If such a withdrawal leaves no pending request for oral hearing in the proceeding, and if the presiding officer has not decided that the hearing should be oral, each other party shall be served with notice of this and shall be given 20 days to request an oral hearing. If any party files a request for oral hearing in such time, the hearing shall be oral in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Presiding Officer's recommendation.</E> The presiding officer may recommend voluntary withdrawal of a request for oral hearing, timely filed. Declining to make such withdrawal shall not affect the rights or interests of any party.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Representation.</E> Any party may appear in an oral hearing, or file evidence <PRTPAGE P="45"/>in a written hearing, in person or by counsel or other representative. For unethical or contumacious conduct in or in connection with a proceeding, the presiding officer may preclude a person from further acting as attorney or representative for any party to the proceeding; any such order of the presiding officer shall be served on the parties; an appeal to the Judicial Officer may be taken from any such order immediately.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 202.112</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Rule 12: Oral hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time, place, and manner.</E> (1) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage where an oral hearing is to be held, the presiding officer shall set a time, place, and manner for oral hearing. The time shall be set based upon careful consideration to the convenience of the parties. The place shall be set in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section and careful consideration to the convenience of the parties. The manner in which the hearing is to be conducted shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The place shall be set in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act, if applicable. In essence, under paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act, if the complainant and the respondent, or all of the parties, if there are more than two, have their principal places of business or residence within a single unit of local government, a single geographical area within a State, or a single State, the oral hearing is to be held as near as possible to such places of business or residence, depending on the availability of an appropriate location for conducting the hearing. If the parties have such places of business or residence distant from each other, then paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 407 of the Act are not applicable.</P>
            <P>(3) The oral hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the oral hearing by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing:</P>
            <P>(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the hearing; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication. If the presiding officer determines that a hearing conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.</P>
            <P>(4) The presiding officer may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if the presiding officer finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:</P>
            <P>(i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;</P>
            <P>(ii) Would not prejudice any party; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice.</E> (1) A notice stating the time, place, and manner of oral hearing shall be served on each party prior to the time of the oral hearing. The notice shall state whether the oral hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to participate in the hearing. If any change is made in the time, place, or manner of the oral hearing, a notice of the change shall be served on each party prior to the time of the oral hearing as changed, unless the change is made during the course of an oral hearing and shown in the transcript or on the recording. Any party may waive such notice, in writing, or orally on the record at an oral hearing and shown in the transcript or on the recording.</P>

            <P>(2) If the presiding officer orders an oral hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the <PRTPAGE P="46"/>hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.</P>
            <P>(3) Within 10 days after the presiding officer issues a notice stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that the presiding officer reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in accordance with the presiding officer's notice.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If any party to the proceeding, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the oral hearing in person or by counsel or other representative, such party shall be deemed to have waived the right to add any further evidence to the record in the proceeding, or to object to the admission of any evidence; if the parties who are present are all adverse to such party, they shall have an election to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of oral testimony before the presiding officer, affidavits, or depositions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Order of proceeding.</E> Complainant shall proceed first, if present at the commencement of the oral hearing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Written statements of direct testimony.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the presiding officer finds that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.</P>
            <P>(2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less than 20 days after the presiding officer's notice stating the time of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The testimony of witnesses at an oral hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination. Any witness other than a party may be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses, in the discretion of the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall exclude evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, insofar as practicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination or to any other ruling of the presiding officer, such party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, and the presiding officer shall rule on it. The transcript or recording shall include argument or debates on objections, except as ordered by the presiding officer, and shall include the ruling of the presiding officer. Objections not made before the presiding officer may not subsequently be relied on in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded by the presiding officer, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement, which shall be included in the transcript or recording, describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in full in the transcript or recording. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the record. In either such event, if the judicial officer <PRTPAGE P="47"/>decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, such evidence shall be considered a part of the record. If the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing, the presiding officer shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in full and, if the judicial officer decides that the presiding officer's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Depositions and affidavits.</E> Except as is otherwise provided in these rules, admission of the deposition of any witness shall be subject to the provisions of rule 9, § 202.109, and affidavits, and statements under penalty of perjury as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1746, Pub. L. 94-550, may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and no party objects.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Department records.</E> A true copy of any written entry in any record of the Department, made by an officer or employee of the Department in the course of the official duty of such officer or employee, and relevant to the issues involved in the hearing, shall be admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the record of the Department, without the production of such officer or employee.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> (i) For each exhibit offered by a party, copies in addition to the original shall be filed with the presiding officer for the use of all other parties to the proceeding, except where the presiding officer finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable. The presiding officer shall tell the parties the number of copies required to be filed, make the proper distribution of the copies, and have this noted on the record.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the testimony of a witness refers to any document, the presiding officer shall determine whether it shall be produced at the hearing and made a part of the record as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated in the record by reference.</P>
            <P>(iii) If relevant and material matter is embraced in a document containing irrelevant or immaterial matter, such irrelevant or immaterial matter shall be designated by the party offering the document in evidence, and shall be segregated and excluded, insofar as practicable.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Subpoenas</E>—(1) <E T="03">Issuance.</E> The attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, from any place in the United States, on behalf of any party to the proceeding, may be required by subpoena at any designated place for oral hearing. Subpoenas may be issued by the presiding officer, on a written application filed by a party, showing the grounds and necessity thereof, and, with respect to subpoenas for the production of documentary evidence, showing their competency, relevancy, and materiality and the necessity for their production. Subpoenas may be issued on the motion of the presiding officer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Service; proof of service.</E> A subpoena may be served by any natural person over the age of 18 years. The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for serving it, however, at the request of such party the Secretary will attempt to serve it.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Oral argument.</E> The presiding officer shall permit oral argument by the parties or their counsel who are present at an oral hearing, but may limit such argument to any extent that the presiding officer finds necessary for the expeditious or proper disposition of the case.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Transcript or recording.</E> (1) Hearings to be conducted by telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing shall be transcribed, unless the presiding officer finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the presiding officer orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim. The presiding officer shall certify that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any recording made pursuant to this paragraph with exhibits that were accepted into evidence is the record of the hearing.</P>

            <P>(2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the presiding officer determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be <PRTPAGE P="48"/>expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the presiding officer shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.</P>
            <P>(3) Parties to the proceeding who desire copies of the transcript or recording of the oral hearing may make arrangements with the reporter, who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to such parties, upon receipt from such parties of payment for the transcript or recording, at the rate provided by the contract between the reporter and the Department for such reporting service.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Filing, and presiding officer's certificate, of the transcript or recording.</E> As soon as practicable after the close of the oral hearing, the reporter shall transmit to the presiding officer the original transcript or recording of the testimony, and as many copies of the transcript or recording as may be required by paragraph (i) of this section for the PSD regional offices and as may be required for the PSD headquarters office in Washington. At the same time the reporter shall also transmit a copy of the transcript or recording to each party who shall have arranged and paid for it, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Upon receipt of the transcript or recording, the presiding officer shall attach to the original transcript or recording a certificate stating that, to the best of the presiding officer's knowledge and belief, the transcript or recording is a true, correct, and complete transcript or recording of the testimony given at the hearing and that the exhibits mentioned in it are all the exhibits received in evidence at the hearing, with such exceptions as the certificate shall specify. Such certificate shall be served on each party and a copy thereof shall be attached to each copy of the transcript or recording received by the presiding officer. In accordance with such certificate the presiding officer shall note, on the original transcript or recording, each correction detailed in such certificate by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the texts as originally transcribed or recorded) at the appropriate places any words necessary to make the text conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall send the copies of the transcript or recording to the hearing clerk who shall send them to PSD headquarters.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Keeping of copies of the transcript or recording.</E> During the period in which the proceeding has an active status in the Department, a copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the PSD regional office most convenient to the respondent; however, if there are two or more respondents and they are located in different regions, such copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the PSD regional office nearest to the place where the hearing was held. In addition, a copy of the transcript or recording shall be kept at the PSD regional office most convenient to the complainant. Any such copy shall be available for examination during official hours of business at the regional office, but shall remain the property of the Department and shall not be removed from such office.</P>

Testimony on deposition, to the extent credible, shall be given greater weight as evidence, than such affidavits or statements. In a case in which a party, entitled to oral hearing as provided in rule 11, § 202.111, withdraws such party's request for oral hearing on condition that only depositions be used if a written hearing is held, only depositions, and documents properly identified therein, shall be made a part of the record as evidence by the parties if a written hearing is held.</P>

Within 20 days after such service, the complainant may file such evidence, which shall be confined strictly to rebuttal of what the respondent has filed. What the complainant files in response to that notice shall be served promptly on the respondent.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure to file.</E> Failure to file any evidence authorized under this section, within the time prescribed, shall constitute a waiver of the right to file such evidence.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of petition</E>—(1) <E T="03">To reopen a hearing.</E> Any party may file a petition to reopen a hearing to take further evidence, at any time prior to the issuance of the final order, or prior to a tentative order becoming final. Such a petition must state the nature and purpose of the evidence to be offered, show that it is not merely cumulative, and state a good reason why it was not offered at the hearing if oral, or filed in the hearing if written.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">To rehear or reargue a proceeding or reconsider an order.</E> Any party may file a petition to rehear or reargue a proceeding or reconsider an order of the judicial officer, at any time within 20 days after service on such party of such order. Such a petition must specify the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided, and the basis for the petitioner's claim that such matters were erroneously decided.</P>

Such a petition must state a good reason why an answer was not filed as required.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Brief or memorandum of law.</E> If such a petitioner wishes to file a brief or memorandum of law in support of such a petition, it must be filed with such petition.</P>

The party filing any such petition shall be referred to as the complainant or respondent, depending on the original designation of such party in the proceeding; such party shall have the burden of establishing that such petition should be granted. If a petition to reopen is timely filed, the order shall not be issued pending decision whether to grant or deny the petition. If a petition to rehear or reargue or reconsider, or to set aside a default order, is timely filed, operation of the order shall be stayed automatically pending decision whether to grant or deny it; if such a petition is not timely filed, operation of the order shall not be stayed unless <PRTPAGE P="51"/>the Judicial Officer shall determine otherwise.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Service; answer.</E> No such petition shall be granted unless it, with the brief or memorandum of law in support of it, if any, is first served on each party to the proceeding other than the one filing it. Each such other party, within 20 days after such service on such party, may file an answer to such petition. If any such party wishes to file a brief or memorandum of law in support of such an answer, it must be filed with such answer. Any such answer, with the brief or memorandum of law in support of it, if any, shall be served on each party to the proceeding other than the one filing it. Any such petition may be denied without such service.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Submission for decision; service of order.</E> The presiding officer shall prepare a recommendation with respect to the petition, and submit it to the judicial officer for decision.

          <SUBJECT>Statement of general policy with respect to the giving by meat packers of meat and other gifts to Government employees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In recent months, the Department has received information, confirmed by investigation, that a number of packers subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act have made gifts of meat to Government employees responsible for conducting service activities of the Department. Such gifts have the implications of fraud, even if not made specifically for the purpose of influencing these employees in the performance of their duties.</P>
          <P>(b) It is a violation of the Meat Inspection Act for any person, firm, or corporation to give to any employee of the Department performing duties under such act anything of value with intent to influence such employee in the discharge of his duties, or for such employee to receive from any person, firm, or corporation engaged in interstate or foreign commerce any gift given with any intent or purpose whatsoever (21 U.S.C. 90). Under the Federal meat grading regulations, the giving or attempting to give by a packer of anything of value to any employee of the Department authorized to perform any function under such regulations is a basis for the withdrawal of Federal meat grading service (7 CFR 53.13). The receiving by an employee of the Department of any gift from any person for whom grading, inspection, or other service work is performed is specifically prohibited by Departmental regulations.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon the basis of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, it is the view of the Department that it is an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of section 202(a) of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 192(a)) for any person subject to the provisions of Title II of said Act to give or offer to give meat, money, or anything of value to any Government employee who performs inspection, grading, reporting, or regulatory duties directly relating to the purchase or sale of livestock or the preparation or distribution of meats, meat food products, livestock products in unmanufactured form, poultry or poultry products.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Records to be kept.</E> Section 401 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 221) provides, in part, that every packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, and dealer shall keep such accounts, records, and memoranda as fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in his business, including the true ownership of such business by stockholding or otherwise. In order to properly administer the P&amp;S Act, it is necessary that records be retained for such periods of time as may be required to permit the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD) a reasonable opportunity to examine such records. Section 401 of the Act does not, however, provide for the destruction or disposal of records. Therefore, the Department has formulated this policy statement to provide guidance as to the periods of time after which records may be disposed of or destroyed.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Records may be disposed of after two years except as otherwise provided.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, and dealer may destroy or dispose of accounts, records, and memoranda which contain, explain, or modify transactions in its business subject to the Act after such accounts, records, and memoranda have been retained for <PRTPAGE P="55"/>a period of two full years; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the following records made or kept by a packer may be disposed of after one year: cutting tests; departmental transfers; buyers' estimates; drive sheets; scale tickets received from others; inventory and products in storage; receiving records; trial balances; departmental overhead or expense recapitulations; bank statements, reconciliations and deposit slips; production or sale tonnage reports (including recapitulations and summaries of routes, branches, plants, etc.); buying or selling pricing instructions and price lists; correspondence; telegrams; teletype communications and memoranda relating to matters other than contracts, agreements, purchase or sales invoices, or claims or credit memoranda; and <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That microfilm copies of records may be substituted for and retained in lieu of the actual records.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Retention for longer periods may be required.</E> The periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be extended if the packer, live poultry dealer, stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer is notified in writing by the Administrator that specified records should be retained for a longer period pending the completion of any investigation or proceedings under the Act.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Unauthorized disposal of records.</E> If it is found that any person subject to the Act has disposed of accounts, records, and memoranda which are necessary to fully and correctly disclose all transactions in its business prior to the periods specified in this statement, consideration will be given to the issuance of a complaint charging a violation of section 401 of the Act and seeking an appropriate order. The administrative proceeding initiated will be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Statement with respect to market agencies paying the expenses of livestock buyers.</SUBJECT>
          <P>It has become a practice in certain areas of the country for market agencies, engaged in the business of selling consigned livestock on a commission basis, to pay certain of the business or personal expenses incurred by buyers attending livestock sales conducted by such market agencies, such as, expenses for meals, lodging, travel, entertainment and long distance telephone calls. Investigation by the Department, discloses that this practice tends to become a method of competition between similarly engaged market agencies and results in undue and unreasonable cost burdens on such market agencies and the livestock producers who sell their livestock through such market agencies.</P>

          <P>It is the view of the Department that it constitutes violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended (7 U.S.C. 181 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), for any market agency engaged in the business of selling consigned livestock on a commission basis, to pay, directly or indirectly, any personal or business expenses of livestock buyers attending sales conducted by such market agency. In the future, if any market agency engages in such practice, consideration will be given by the PSD to the issuance of a complaint charging the market agency with violation of the Act. In the formal administrative proceeding initiated by any such complaint, the Judicial Officer of the Department will determine, after full hearing, whether the market agency has violated the Act and should be ordered to cease and desist from continuing such violation, and whether the registration of such market agency should be suspended for a reasonable period of time.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Statement with respect to meat packer sales and purchase contracts.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The PSD receives numerous complaints concerning the failure or refusal of buyers to pay the full purchase price for, or to accept delivery of, their purchases of meat and meat food products and sellers failing to meet contractual specifications. Most such complaints arise out of disputes concerning condition, grade, weight, or shipping instructions.</P>
          <P>(b) It is believed that both seller and buyer should take the following points into consideration when selling and buying meat and meat food products:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Terms of shipment and time of arrival.</E> Terms and conditions of shipment and delivery should be specified in the contract and both parties should understand fully all terms and conditions of the contract. Any deviation from normal practices, such as a guaranty by the shipper as to the date of arrival at destination, or a deviation from the normal meaning of terms, should also be fully understood and made a part of the contract.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Quality and condition.</E> (i) A seller has the responsibility of making certain that the meat and meat food products shipped are in accordance with the terms of the contract specifications.</P>
          <P>(ii) When a buyer believes that the shipment does not meet the terms of the contract, he should immediately contact the seller or the seller's agent and advise him of the nature of the complaint. This affords the seller an opportunity to renegotiate the contract, to personally inspect the meat or meat food products, or to have an impartial party inspect or examine the meat or meat food products. Inspection and examination service of this type is available nationally through the USDA meat grading service and locally through various impartial persons or agencies.</P>
          <P>(iii) All terms of a transaction should be made clear in the contract, whether written or verbal. If there is any chance of misunderstanding, a written confirmation should be exchanged between the parties. In any case where a contract dispute cannot be settled between the parties and either party intends to file a complaint, such complaint should be brought to the attention of the nearest PSD regional office as soon as possible. However, a concerted effort on the part of both buyer and seller to negotiate clear and complete contracts will greatly reduce misunderstandings which can result in the filing of complaints with PSD.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Statement with respect to insolvency; definition of current assets and current liabilities.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended and supplemented (7 U.S.C. 181 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the principal test of insolvency is to determine whether a person's current liabilities exceed his current assets. This current ratio test of insolvency under the Act has been reviewed and affirmed by a United States Court of Appeals. <E T="03">Bowman v. United States Department of Agriculture,</E> 363 F. 2d 81 (5th Cir. 1966).</P>
          <P>(b) For the purposes of the administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Current assets</E> means cash and other assets or resources commonly <PRTPAGE P="57"/>identified as those which are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business, which is considered to be one year.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Current liabilities</E> means obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the use of existing resources principally classifiable as current assets or the creation of other current liabilities during the one year operating cycle of the business.</P>
          <P>(c) The term current assets generally includes: (1) Cash in bank or on hand; (2) sums due a market agency from a custodial account for shippers' proceeds; (3) accounts receivable, if collectible; (4) notes receivable and portions of long-term notes receivable within one year from date of balance sheet, if collectable; (5) inventories of livestock acquired for purposes of resale or for purposes of market support; (6) feed inventories and other inventories which are intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle of the business; (7) accounts due from employees, if collectable; (8) accounts due from officers of a corporation, if collectable; (9) accounts due from affiliates and subsidiaries of corporations if the financial position of such subsidiaries and affiliates justifies such classification; (10) marketable securities representing cash available for current operations and not otherwise pledged as security; (11) accrued interest receivable; and (12) prepaid expenses.</P>
          <P>(d) The term current assets generally excludes: (1) Cash and claims to cash which are restricted as to withdrawal, such as custodial funds for shippers' proceeds and current proceeds receivable from the sale of livestock sold on a commission basis; (2) investments in securities (whether marketable or not) or advances which have been made for the purposes of control, affiliation, or other continuing business advantage; (3) receivables which are not expected to be collected within 12 months; (4) cash surrender value of life insurance policies; (5) land and other natural resources; and (6) depreciable assets.</P>
          <P>(e) The term current liabilities generally includes: (1) Bank overdrafts (per books); (2) amounts due a custodial account for shippers' proceeds; (3) accounts payable within one year from date of balance sheet; (4) notes payable or portions thereof due and payable within one year from date of balance sheet; (5) accruals such as taxes, wages, social security, unemployment compensation, etc., due and payable as of the date of the balance sheet; and (6) all other liabilities whose regular and ordinary liquidation is expected to occur within one year.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Statement with respect to providing services and facilities at stockyards on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Section 304 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 205) provides that: “All stockyard services furnished pursuant to reasonable request made to a stockyard owner or market agency at such stockyard shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory and stockyard services which are furnished shall not be refused on any basis that is unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory….”</P>
          <P>(b) Section 305 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 206) states that: “All rates or charges made for any stockyard services furnished at a stockyard by a stockyard owner or market agency shall be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory….”</P>
          <P>(c) Section 307 (7 U.S.C. 208) provides that: “It shall be the duty of every stockyard owner and market agency to establish, observe, and enforce just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory regulations and practices in respect to the furnishing of stockyard services….”</P>

          <P>(d) Section 312(a) (7 U.S.C. 213(a)) provides that: “It shall be unlawful for any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice or device in connection with determining whether persons should be authorized to operate at the <PRTPAGE P="58"/>stockyards, or with the receiving, marketing, buying, or selling on a commission basis or otherwise, feeding, watering, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing or handling, in commerce, of livestock.”</P>
          <P>(e) Section 301(b) (7 U.S.C. 201(b)) defines “stockyard services” as any “services or facilities furnished at a stockyard in connection with the receiving, buying, or selling on a commission basis or otherwise, marketing, feeding, watering, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing, or handling, in commerce, of livestock.”</P>
          <P>(f) It is the view of the Department that it is a violation of sections 304, 307, and 312(a) of the Act for a stockyard owner or market agency to discriminate, in the furnishing of stockyard services or facilities or in establishing rules or regulations at the stockyard, because of race, religion, color, or national origin of those persons using the stockyard services or facilities. Such services and facilities include, but are not limited to, the restaurant, restrooms, drinking fountains, lounge accommodations, those furnished for the selling, weighing, or other handling of the livestock, and facilities for observing such services.</P>
          <P>(g) If the PSD has reason to believe that any stockyard owner or market agency has so discriminated in the furnishing of stockyard services or facilities, consideration will be given to the issuance of a complaint charging the stockyard or market agency with violations of the Act.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Who is a customer?</E> (a) A <E T="03">customer</E> is a person who buys for resale directly from the packer, or through the packer's agent or broker; and in addition, a customer is any buyer of the packer's product for resale who purchases from or through a wholesaler or other intermediate reseller.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">(Note:</HD>
              <P>In determining whether a packer has fulfilled its obligations toward its customers, the PSD will recognize that there may be some exceptions to this general definition of “customer.” For example, the purchaser of distress merchandise would not be considered a “customer” simply on the basis of such purchase. Similarly, a retailer who purchases solely from other retailers or one who makes only sporadic purchases, or one who does not regularly sell the packer's product or who is a type of retail outlet not usually selling such products will not be considered a “customer” of the packer unless the packer has been put on notice that such retailer is selling its product.)</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Competing customers</E> are all businesses that compete in the resale of the packer's products of like grade and quality at the same functional level of distribution, regardless of whether they purchase direct from the packer or through some intermediary.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
            <P>A packer sells directly to some independent retailers, sells to the headquarters of chains and of retailer-owned cooperatives, and also sells to wholesalers. The direct-buying independent retailers, the headquarters of chains and of retailer-owned cooperatives, and the wholesalers' independent retailer customers are customers of the packer. Individual retail outlets which are part of the chains or members of the retailer-owned cooperatives are not customers of the packer.</P>

          <EXTRACT>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Definition of services. Services</E> are any kind of advertising or promotion of a packer's product, including but not limited to, cooperative advertising, handbills, window and floor displays, demonstrators and demonstrations, customer coupons, and point of purchase activity.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Need for a plan.</E> If a packer makes payments or furnishes services, it should do so under a plan that meets several requirements. If there are many competing customers to be considered, or if the plan is at all complex, the packer would be well advised to put its plan in writing. The requirements are:</P>

            <P>(a) Proportionally equal terms—The payments or services under the plan should be made available to all competing customers on proportionally equal terms. This means that payments or services should be made proportionately on some basis that is fair to all customers who compete in the resale of the packer's products. No single way to achieve the proper proportion is prescribed, and any method that treats competing customers on proportionally equal terms may be used. Generally, this can best be done by basing the payments made or the services furnished on the dollar volume or on the <PRTPAGE P="59"/>quantity of goods purchased during a specified period. Other methods which are fair to all competing customers are also acceptable.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
            <P>A packer may properly offer to pay a specified part (say 50 percent) of the cost of local advertising up to an amount equal to a set percentage (such as 5 percent) of the dollar volume of such purchases during a specified time.</P>
          </EXAMPLE>
          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
            <P>A packer may properly place in reserve for each customer a specified amount of money for each unit purchased and use it to reimburse those customers for the cost of advertising and promoting the packer's product during a specified time.</P>
          </EXAMPLE>
          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3:</HD>
            <P>A packer's plan should not provide an allowance on a basis that has rates graduated with the amount of goods purchased, as for instance, 1 percent of the first $1,000 purchases per month, 2 percent on second $1,000 per month, and 3 percent on all over that.</P>
          </EXAMPLE>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>(b) Packer's duty to inform—The packer should take reasonable action, in good faith, to inform all its competing customers of the availability of its promotional program. Such notification should include all the relevant details of the offer in time to enable customers to make an informed judgment whether to participate. Where such one-step notification is impracticable, the packer may, in lieu thereof, maintain a continuing program of first notifying all competing customers of the types of promotions offered by the packer and a specific source for the customer to contact in order to receive full and timely notice of all relevant details of the packer's promotions. Such notice should also inform all competing customers that the packer offers advertising allowances and/or other promotional assistance that are usable in a practical business sense by all retailers regardless of size. When a customer indicates its desire to be put on the notification list, the packer should keep that customer advised of all promotions available in its area as long as the customer so desires. The packer may make the required notification by any means it chooses; but in order to show later that it gave notice to a certain customer, it is in a better position to do so if it was given in writing or a record was prepared at the time of notification showing date, person notified, and contents of notification.</P>
            <P>If more direct methods of notification are impracticable, a packer may employ one or more of the following methods, the sufficiency of which will depend upon the complexity of its own distribution system. Different packers may find that different notification methods are most effective for them:</P>
            <P>(1) The packer may enter into contracts with its wholesaler, distributors or other third parties which conform to the requirements of item 5, infra.</P>
            <P>(2) The packer may place appropriate announcements on product containers or inside thereof with conspicuous notice of such enclosure on the outside.</P>
            <P>(3) The packer may publish notice of the availability and essential features of a promotional plan in a publication of general distribution in the trade.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
            <P>A packer has a wholesaler-oriented plan directed to wholesalers distributing its products to retailing customers. It should notify all the competing wholesalers distributing its products of the availability of this plan, but the packer is not required to notify retailing customers.</P>
          </EXAMPLE>
          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
            <P>A packer who sells on a direct basis to some retailers in an area, and to other retailers in the area through wholesalers, has a plan for the promotion of its products at the retail level. If the packer directly notifies not only all competing direct purchasing retailers but also all competing retailers purchasing through the wholesalers as to the availability, terms and conditions of the plan, the packer is not required to notify its wholesalers.</P>
          </EXAMPLE>
          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3:</HD>
            <P>A packer regularly engages in promotional programs and the competing customers include large direct purchasing retailers and smaller customers who purchase through wholesalers. The packer may encourage, but not coerce, the retailer purchasing through a wholesaler to designate a wholesaler as its agent for receiving notice of, collecting, and using promotional allowances for the customer. If a wholesaler or other intermediary by written agreement with a retailer is actually authorized to collect promotional payments from suppliers, the packer may assume that notice of and payment under a promotional plan to such wholesaler or intermediary constitutes notice and payment to the retailer.</P>
            <P>(A packer should not rely on a written agreement authorizing an intermediary to receive notice of and/or payment under a promotional plan for a retailer if the packer knows, or should know, that the retailer was coerced into signing the agreement. In addition, a packer should assume that an intermediary is not authorized to receive notice of and/or payment under a promotional plan for a retailer unless there is a written authorization signed by such retailer.)</P>
          </EXAMPLE>
          
          <EXTRACT>

            <P>(c) Availability to all competing customers—The plan should be such that all types of competing customers may participate. It should not be tailored to favor or discriminate against a particular customer or class of customers but should, in its terms, be usable in a practical business sense by all competing customers. This may require offering all such customers more than one way to participate in the plan or offering alternative terms and conditions to customers for whom the basic plan is not usable <PRTPAGE P="60"/>and suitable. The packer should not, either expressly or by the way the plan operates, eliminate some competing customers, although it may offer alternative plans designed for different customer classes. If it offers alternative plans, all of the plans offered should provide the same proportionate equality and the packer should inform competing customers of the various alternative plans.</P>
            <P>When a packer, in good faith, offers a basic plan, including alternatives, which is reasonably fair and nondiscriminatory and refrains from taking any steps which would prevent any customer, or class of customers, from participating in its program, it shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to make its plan functionally available to all customers, and the failure of any customer or customers to participate in the program shall not be deemed to place the packer in violation of the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act.</P>

          <EXAMPLE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>
            <P>A packer offers a plan of short term store displays of varying sizes, including some which are suitable for each of its competing customers and at the same time are small enough so that each customer may make use of the promotion in a practical business sense. The plan also calls for uniform, reasonable certification of performance by the retailer. Because they are reluctant to process a reasonable amount of paperwork, some small retailers do not participate. This fact is not deemed to place a packer in violation of Item 3(c) and it is under no obligation to provide additional alternatives.</P>

            <P>A packer offers a plan for cooperative advertising on radio, television, or in newspapers of general circulation. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> Because the purchases of some of its customers are too small, this offer is not “functionally available” to them. The packer should offer them alternative(s) on proportionally equal terms that are usable by them and suitable for their business.</P>

                <SU>1</SU> In order to avoid the tailoring of promotional programs that discriminate against particular customers or class of customers, the packer in offering to pay allowances for newspaper advertising should offer to pay the same percentage of the cost of newspaper advertising for all competing customers in a newspaper of the customer's choice, or at least in those newspapers that meet the requirements for second class mail privileges.</P>

          </EXAMPLE>
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>(d) Need to understand terms—In informing customers of the details of a plan, the packer should provide them sufficient information to give a clear understanding of the exact terms of the offer, including all alternatives, and the conditions upon which payment will be made or services furnished.</P>
            <P>(e) Checking customer's use of payments—The packer should take reasonable precautions to see that services it is paying for are furnished and also that it is not overpaying for them. Moreover, the customer should expend the allowance solely for the purpose for which it was given. If the packer knows or should know that what it pays or furnishes is not being properly used by some customers, the improper payments or services should be discontinued. <SU>2</SU>

            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> The granting of allowances or payments that have little or no relationship to cost or approximate cost of the service provided by the retailer may be considered a violation of section 202 of the Act.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>A packer who, in good faith, takes reasonable and prudent measures to verify the performance of its competing customers will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under the Act. Also, a packer who, in good faith, concludes a promotional agreement with wholesalers or other intermediaries and who otherwise conforms to the standards of Item 5 shall be deemed to have satisfied this obligation. If a packer has taken such steps, the fact that a particular customer has retained an allowance in excess of the cost, or approximate cost if the actual cost is not known, of services performed by the customer shall not alone be deemed to place a packer in violation of the Act.</P>
            <P>(When customers may have different but closely related costs in furnishing services that are difficult to determine such as the cost for distributing coupons from a bulletin board or using a window banner, the packer may furnish to each customer the same payment if it has a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing the service or is not grossly in excess thereof.)</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Competing customers.</E> The packer is required to provide in its plan only for those customers who compete with each other in the resale of the packer's products of like grade and quality. Therefore a packer should make available to all competing wholesalers any plan providing promotional payments or services to wholesalers, and similarly should make available to all competing retailers any plan providing promotional payments or services to retailers. With these requirements met, a packer can limit the area of its promotion. However, this section is not intended to deal with the question of a packer's liability for use of an area promotion where the effect may be to injure the packer's competition.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Wholesaler or third party performance of packer's obligations.</E> A packer may, in good faith, enter into written agreements with intermediaries, such as wholesalers, distributors or other third parties, including promoters of tripartite promotional plans, which provide that such intermediaries will <PRTPAGE P="61"/>perform all or part of the packer's obligations under this part. However, the interposition of intermediaries between the packer and its customers does not relieve the packer of its ultimate responsibility of compliance with the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act. The packer, in order to demonstrate its good faith effort to discharge its obligations under this part, should include in any such agreement provisions that the intermediary will:</P>
            <P>(1) Give notice to the packer's customers in conformity with the standards set forth in items 3(b) and (d), supra;</P>
            <P>(2) Check customer performance in conformity with the standards set forth in item 3(e), supra;</P>
            <P>(3) Implement the plan in a manner which will insure its functional availability to the packer's customers in conformity with the standards set forth in item 3(c), supra (This must be done whether the plan is one devised by the packer itself or by the intermediary for use by the packer's customers.); and</P>
            <P>(4) Provide certification in writing and at reasonable intervals that the packer's customers have been and are being treated in conformity with the agreement.</P>
            <P>A packer who negotiates such agreements with its wholesalers, distributors or third party promoters will be considered by the Administration to have justified its “good faith” obligations under this section only if it accompanies such agreements with the following supplementary measures: At regular intervals the packer takes affirmative steps to verify that its customers are receiving the proportionally equal treatment to which they are entitled by making spot checks designed to reach a representative cross section of its customers. Whenever such spot checks indicate that the agreements are not being implemented in such a way that its customers are receiving such proportionally equal treatment, the packer takes immediate steps to expand or to supplement such agreements in a manner reasonably designed to eliminate the repetition or continuation of any such discriminations in the future.</P>
            <P>Intermediaries, subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act, administering promotional assistance programs on behalf of a packer may be in violation of the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act, if they have agreed to perform the packer's obligations under the Act with respect to a program which they have represented to be usable and suitable for all the packer's competing customers if it should later develop that the program was not offered to all or, if offered, was not usable or suitable, or was otherwise administered in a discriminatory manner.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Customer's liability.</E> A customer, subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act, who knows, or should know, that it is receiving payments or services which are not available on proportionally equal terms to its competitors engaged in the resale of the same packer's products may be in violation of the provisions of the Act. Also, customers (subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act) that make unauthorized deductions from purchase invoices for alleged advertising or other promotional allowances may be proceeded against under the provisions of the Act.</P>

            <P>7. <E T="03">Meeting competition.</E> A packer charged with discrimination under the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act may defend its actions by showing that the payments were made or the services were furnished in good faith to meet equally high payments made by a competing packer to the particular customer, or to meet equivalent services furnished by a competing packer to the particular customer. This defense, however, is subject to important limitations. For instance, it is insufficient to defend solely on the basis that competition in a particular market is very keen, requiring that special allowances be given to some customers if a packer is “to be competitive.”</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Cost justification.</E> It is no defense to a charge of unlawful discrimination in the payment of an allowance or the furnishing of a service for a packer to show that such payment or service could be justified through savings in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery.</P>

          <P>(a) Within the times specified under sections 206(b) and 207(d) of the Act, any livestock seller, live poultry seller or grower, to preserve his interest in the statutory trust, must give written notice to the appropriate packer or live poultry dealer and file such notice with the Secretary. One of the ways to satisfy the notification requirement under these provisions is to make certain that notice is given to the packer or live poultry dealer within the prescribed time by letter, mailgram, or telegram stating:<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Notification to preserve trust benefits:</P>
          <P>(2) Identification of packer or live poultry dealer;</P>

          <P>(6) Amount of money due; and to make certain that a copy of such letter, mailgram, or telegram is filed with a PSD regional office or with the PSD headquarters office within the prescribed time.</P>
          <P>(b) While the above information is desirable, any written notice which informs the packer or live poultry dealer and the Secretary that the packer or live poultry dealer has failed to pay is sufficient to meet the above-mentioned statutory requirement if it is given within the prescribed time.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Mailing of checks in payment for livestock purchased for slaughter, for cash and not on credit.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The Department recognizes that one who sells livestock to a packer, market agency, or dealer, who is purchasing for slaughter, may not intend to be present at the point of transfer of possession of the livestock, to receive payment, at the time a check in payment for such livestock may be delivered by the purchaser, and may not wish to authorize a representative to receive such a check; or for other reasons such a seller may prefer that such a purchaser make payment by mailing a check within the time limit as prescribed in section 409(a) of the Act. In cases when the seller does not intend to be present, he may use the following form of notification to the purchaser:
          </P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>I do not intend to be present at the point of transfer of possession of livestock sold by me to (name of packer, market agency, or dealer) for the purpose of receiving a check in payment for such livestock.</P>
            <P>I hereby direct (name of packer, market agency, or dealer) to make payment for livestock purchased from me, by mailing a check for the full amount of the purchase price before the close of the next business day following the purchase of livestock and transfer of possession thereof or, in the case of a purchase on a “carcass” or “grade and yield” basis, not later than the close of the first business day following determination of the purchase price.</P>
            <P>This does not constitute an extension of credit to (name of packer, market agency or dealer). This is subject to cancellation by me at any time, and if not cancelled by (date), it shall terminate on that date.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <FP>If the seller, for reasons other than not being present to receive payment, prefers to have the packer, market agency, or dealer make payment by mailing a check within the time limit as provided in section 409(a), he may use the above form but should not include the statement in the first sentence that he does not intend to be present.</FP>
          <P>(b) The Department believes that such an agreement would not constitute an extension of credit within the meaning of section 206 of the Act because it would not give the purchaser any more time to issue a check than is provided in section 409(a).</P>

          <P>(a) Requests have been received from stockyard operators, market agencies, and livestock producers urging a reduction of rate regulation at posted stockyards. Their requests are based on the belief that competition among markets will set a level of rates and charges fair to both the market operator and to the livestock producer. PSD will accept for filing tariffs containing any level of charges after 10 days' notice to the public and to the Secretary as required by the Act.</P>

          <P>(b) PSD will not investigate the level of rates and charges established by <PRTPAGE P="63"/>stockyard owners and market agencies for reasonableness except upon receipt of a valid complaint or under compelling circumstances warranting such an investigation. Stockyard owners and market agencies will have substantial flexibility in setting their own rates and charges.</P>
          <P>(c) Complaints filed about the reasonableness of rates and charges will be investigated to determine the validity of such complaints and appropriate action taken if warranted.</P>
          <P>(d) PSD will continue to insure that the schedules of rates and charges filed with the Department are applied uniformly and in a nondiscriminatory manner.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Statement with respect to packers engaging in the business of custom feeding livestock.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In its administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Department has sought to promote and maintain open and fair competition in the livestock and packing industries, and to prevent unfair or anticompetitive practices when they are found to exist. It is the opinion of the Department that the ownership or operation of custom feedlots by packers presents problems which may under some circumstances result in violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act.</P>
          <P>(b) Packers contemplating entering into such arrangements with custom feedlots are encouraged to consult with the Administration prior to the commencement of such activities. Custom feedlots are not only places of production, but are also important marketing centers, and in connection with the operation of a custom feedlot, it is customary for the feedlot operator to assume responsibility for marketing fed livestock for the accounts of feedlot customers. When a custom feedlot is owned or operated by a packer, and when such packer purchases fed livestock from the feedlot, this method of operation potentially gives rise to a conflict of interest. In such situations, the packer's interest in the fed livestock as a buyer is in conflict with its obligations to feedlot customers to market their livestock to the customer's best advantage. Under these circumstances, the packer should take appropriate measures to eliminate any conflict of interest. At a minimum, such measures should insure:</P>
          <P>(1) That feedlot customers are fully advised of the common ties between the feedlot and the packer, and of their rights and options with respect to the marketing of their livestock;</P>
          <P>(2) That all feedlot customers are treated equally by the packer/custom feedlot in connection with the marketing of fed livestock; and</P>
          <P>(3) That marketing decisions rest solely with the feedlot customer unless otherwise expressly agreed.</P>
          <P>(c) Packer ownership or operation of custom feedlots may also give rise to competitive problems in some situations. Packers contemplating or engaging in the business of operating a custom feedlot should carefully review their operations to assure that no restriction of competition exists or is likely to occur.</P>
          <P>(d) The Department does not consider the existence of packer/custom feedlot relationships, by itself, to constitute a violation of the Act. In the event it appears that a packer/custom feedlot arrangement gives rise to a violation of the Act, an investigation will be made on a case-by-case basis, and, where warranted, appropriate action will be taken.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Statement with respect to packers engaging in the business of livestock dealers or buying agencies.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) In its administration of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Department has sought to prevent conflicts of interest and to maintain open and fair competition in the livestock and meat packing industries. The ownership or operation of livestock dealers or buying agencies by packers, under some <PRTPAGE P="64"/>circumstances, may result in violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act.</P>
          <P>(b) Traditionally, livestock dealers and buying agencies purchase livestock for resale or to fill orders for farmers, ranchers, producers, other livestock firms and packers. When a livestock dealer or buying agency is owned or operated by a packer, and when such packer is also buying livestock for its own operational requirements, there is a potential conflict of interest. Furthermore, the purchase and sale of livestock by meat packers may result in control of markets and prices which could adversely affect both livestock producers, competing packers, and consumers.</P>
          <P>(c) Arrangements between packers and dealers or buying agencies which do not normally create a conflict of interest or result in a restraint of competition include:</P>
          <P>(1) Operations utilizing different species or classes of livestock; </P>
          <P>(2) Operations where the business activities are widely separated geographically; and</P>
          <P>(3) Operations where tie-in purchases or sales are not involved. Packers contemplating engaging in the business of a livestock dealer or a buying agency are encouraged to consult with the PSD prior to the commencement of such activities.</P>
          <P>(d) In the event a packer/dealer or a packer/buying agency arrangement appears to give rise to a violation of the Act, an investigation will be made on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, appropriate action will be taken.</P>

            <P>(a) An EFS under subsection (c)(4) need not be the same as a financing statement or security agreement under the Uniform Commercial Code (or equivalent document under future successor State law), but can be an entirely separate document meeting the definition in (c)(4). Note that (c)(4) contains a comprehensive definition of the term which does not include any requirement that the EFS be the instrument by which a security interest is created or perfected. Note also the House Committee Report on Pub. L. 99-198, No. 99-271, Part 1, September 13, 1985, at page 110: “[T]he bill would not preempt basic state-law rules on the creation, perfection, or priority of security interests.”</P>
            <P>(b) An EFS may be filed electronically provided a State allows electronic filing of financing statements without the signature of the debtor under applicable State law under provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or may be a paper document. An electronically filed EFS need not be a paper document and need not be signed.

            <SUBJECT>Distribution of portions of master list—registration—information to non-registrants on request.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The provisions in the Section regarding registration of “buyers of farm products, commission merchants, and selling agents,” “regular” distribution of “portions” of the master list, furnishing of “oral confirmation * * * on request,” and the effect of all this, that is, subsections (c)(2) (D), (E) and (F), (e) (2) and (3), and (g)(2) (C) and (D), must be read together.</P>
            <P>(b) The Section does not require such persons to register. Not registering with a particular system operator has the effect, under subsections (e)(2) and (g)(2)(C), of making such persons, whether they are inside or outside the State covered by that system, subject to security interests shown on that system's master list whether or not such persons know about them, so that such persons for their own protection will need to query the system operator about any seller “engaged in farming operations,” of a farm product produced in the State covered by that system, with whom they deal.</P>
            <P>(c) The effect of registration by such persons with a particular system is to get them on the list for regular distribution of portions of that system's master list, the portions to be determined by the registration. They are subject only to security interests shown on the portions which they receive, and are not subject to such interests as are shown on the master list but not shown on portions which they receive. Also, if a particular security interest is shown on the master list, but has been placed on it since the last regular distribution of portions of that list to registrants, registrants would not be subject to that security interest. These conclusions are based on the provisions in subsections (e)(3)(A) and (g)(2)(D)(i) that such persons are subject to a security interest only if they receive “written notice * * * that specifies both the seller and the farm product.”</P>
            <P>(d) A question arises as to the length of time for which a registration is effective, and whether a registrant, wishing to change registration as to county or product, can amend an existing registration or must file a new one. This is discretionary with the State since the Section is silent about it.</P>

            <P>(e) A question arises whether persons can register to receive only portions of the list for products in which they do not deal, and thus not be subject to security interests in products in which they deal because they are registrants but do not receive written notice of them. For example, can cattle dealers register to receive portions of the master list only for oranges, and thus take cattle free and clear of security interests shown on the master list, but as to which they do not receive written notice because they have not registered to receive the portion for cattle? Registrants will be deemed to be registered only <E T="03">as to those portions</E> of the master list for which they register, and will be deemed to have failed to register as to <PRTPAGE P="71"/>those portions for which they do not register.</P>
            <P>(f) The Section requires “regular” distribution, to registrants, of portions of the master list as amended from time to time by the filing of EFS's and amendments to EFS's. The requirement that the distribution be “regular” necessarily refers to an interval specified in advance. The interval may vary according to product and region. The frequency of such distribution must be a consideration in review for certification since distribution must be timely to serve its purpose. While subsection (c)(2)(E) (providing that distribution be made “regularly as prescribed by the State”) gives each State discretion to choose the interval between distributions, whatever interval a State chooses will inevitably make possible some transactions in which security interests are filed in the system but registrants are not subject to them.</P>
            <P>(g) Legislative history of the Section shows that buyers, commission merchants, and selling agents are not intended to be liable for errors or other inaccuracies generated by the system. See Nov. 22, 1985 Cong. Rec., Senate, pg. S16300, and Dec. 18, 1985 Cong. Rec., House, pg. H12523.</P>

            <P>(h) In furnishing to non-registrants “oral confirmation within 24 hours of any [EFS] on request followed by written confirmation,” by a system operator pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(F), any failure in use of a telephone caused by a “busy signal” could not be the basis of liability of the system operator. The basis for this is that subsection (c)(2)(F) does not mention telephones. Also, while it mentions <E T="03">furnishing</E> information orally, it does not contain any provision as to how queries are to be <E T="03">received,</E> that is, orally, in writing, or otherwise.</P>
            <P>(i) Of course it is to be expected that telephones would be used in most cases, but use of them is not required by the legislation and is discretionary with the State.</P>
            <P>(j) In the matter of receiving queries and giving oral replies to them, subsection (c)(2)(F) will be complied with if a system operator maintains an office and staff where a query can be received on business days and during business hours such as are regular in the State, and where an oral reply will be available on the regular business day following the day on which the query is received, at or before the time of day when it was received.</P>
            <P>(k) Written confirmation is required, by subsection (c)(2)(F), to be given to any non-registered buyer, commission merchant, or selling agent.</P>
            <P>(l) Such a written confirmation pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(F) does not alter the liability of the non-registrant querying the system and receiving information about a security interest recorded in it. The basis of this, as above, is that non-registrants are subject to security interests recorded in a system whether or not they know about them, and must query the system for their own protection.</P>
            <P>(m) The Section does not specify when or how the written confirmation must be furnished, but provides only that it must follow the oral information. Thus the time and method of furnishing written confirmation is discretionary with the State.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Amendment or continuation of EFS.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The “material change,” required by subsection (c)(4)(D) to be reflected in an amendment to an EFS and master list entry, is whatever change would render the master list entry no longer informative as to what is subject to the security interest in question. That will vary from case to case. The basis for this is the purpose for which the information is supplied, that is, to make information available, to a buyer, commission merchant, or selling agent who proposes to enter into a transaction in a product, whether it is subject to a security interest. The requirement to amend arises when the information already made available no longer serves the purpose and other information is needed in order to do so.</P>

            <P>(b) Where an owner of a product makes a change, such as planting a different crop or purchasing different animals from what was represented, without informing the secured party, so <PRTPAGE P="72"/>that the master list entry is rendered not informative, but the EFS and master list are not amended through no fault of the secured party, the Section is silent as to the consequences. However, see the legislative history cited in § 205.208(f).</P>
            <P>(c) The amendment must be filed in the same manner as the original filing. Note the requirement of subsection (c)(4)(D). The amendment may be filed electronically provided a State allows electronic filing of financing statements without the signature of the debtor under applicable State law under provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code. An electronically filed amendment need not be signed. However, if an original or reproduced paper document is filed, the amendment must be signed, authorized, or otherwise authenticated by the debtor, and be filed by the secured party.</P>
            <P>(d) An effective financing statement remains effective for a period of 5 years from the date of filing and may be continued in increments of 5-year periods beyond the initial 5-year filing period by refiling an effective financing statement or by filing a continuation statement within 6 months before expiration of the effective financing statement. A continuation statement may be filed electronically or as a paper document, and need not be signed, authorized, or otherwise authenticated by the debtor.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Effect of EFS outside State in which filed.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A question arises whether, if an EFS is filed in one State, a notice of it can be filed in another State and shown on the master list for the second State. There is nothing in the Section to prevent this, but it would serve no purpose.</P>

            <P>(b) The Section provides only for filing an EFS, covering a given product, in the system for the State in which it is produced or located. Upon such filing in such system, subsections (e)(2) and (g)(2)(C) make buyers, commission merchants and selling agents <E T="03">not registered</E> with that system subject to the security interest in that product whether or not they know about it, <E T="03">even if they are outside that State.</E> Subsections (e)(3) and (g)(2)(D) make persons <E T="03">registered</E> with that system subject if they receive written notice of it <E T="03">even if they are outside that State.</E> All of these provisions apply only where an EFS is filed in the system for the State in which the product is produced or located. They do not apply to a filing in another system.</P>
            <P>(c) What constitutes “receipt” of notice is determined by the law of the State in which the intended recipient of notice resides. This is based on subsection (f) which follows provisions for notice to buyers, and (g)(3) which follows provisions for notice to commission merchants and selling agents. Each of those provisions uses the word “buyer” but it means “intended recipient of notice.”</P>

            <P>(a) Court decisions under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), about the scope of the “farm products” exception in Section 9-307(1) thereof, and interpreting the terms therein, particularly “person engaged in farming operations” which is not defined in the Section, are applicable to an extent in interpreting the Section. The basis of this is the legislative intent of the Section to pre-empt State laws reflecting that “farm products” exception, as shown in the House Committee Report on Pub. L. 99-198, No. 99-271, Part 1, September 13, 1985, at pages 108 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) That UCC Section 9-307(1) reads as follows:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>

              <P>(1) A buyer in ordinary course of business (subsection (9) of Section 1-201) <E T="03">other than a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations</E> takes free of a security interest created by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.

            <SECTNO>§ 205.212</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>“Buyer in ordinary course of business” and “security interest.”</SUBJECT>

            <P>The terms “buyer in ordinary course of business” and “security interest” <PRTPAGE P="73"/>are defined in subsections (c) (1) and (7). There are differences between those definitions and the UCC definitions of the same terms. In interpreting those differences, the following would be pertinent:</P>
            <P>(a) The legislative intent discussed above in § 205.211, to pre-empt State laws reflecting the “farm products” exception; and</P>
            <P>(b) The legislative intent shown in subsections (a) and (b) that certain persons take free and clear of certain interests of a “secured lender” “when the seller fails to repay the lender,” unless such persons have information about such interests made available to them as provided in the Section.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 205.213</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Obligations subject—“person indebted”—“debtor.”</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A debt need not exist at the time of filing of an EFS. The basis for this is that subsection (c)(4) does not require the EFS, and subsection (c)(2)(C) does not require the master list, to show any amount of debt.</P>
            <P>(b) The Section does not provide for the transaction in which one person subjects a product to a security interest for another's debt. However the terms “person indebted” and “debtor” in the Section refer to the person who owns a product and subjects it to a security interest, whether or not that person owes a debt to the secured party. The basis for this is the purpose for which the information is supplied. Any buyer of a farm product, commission merchant, or selling agent querying a master list or system operator about a prospective seller of a farm product is interested in whether that seller has subjected that product to a security interest, not in whether the debt is owed by that seller or by another.</P>
            <P>(c) Security interests existing prior to establishment of a system can be filed in such a system and reflected in the master list if documents are in existence or are created which meet the requirements of subsection (c)(4) besides filing, if such documents are filed wherever State law requires, and if the system operator receives the information about them needed for the master list.</P>
            <P>(d) A system can be in compliance with the Section, although it reflects security interests not supported by EFS's as defined in the legislation, and although it reflects security interests on items other than farm products. However, subsections (e) (2) and (3), and (g)(2) (C) and (D), will apply only as to entries reflecting farm products and supported by EFS's as defined in the Section, and it must be possible to distinguish the entries to which these provisions apply from the other entries.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Litigation as to whether a system is operating in compliance with the Section.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The requirements for a system in subsection (c) are written as the definition of the term “central filing system,” so that failure of a system to meet any such requirement, either at the time of its establishment or later, will mean that it is not a “central filing system” as defined.</P>
            <P>(b) The issue whether a system, after certification, is operating in compliance, thus whether it is a “central filing system” as defined, could be litigated and ruled on in a case involving only private parties, such as a lender and a buyer of a farm product. The only immediate effect of a finding in such a case, that a system is not a “central filing system” as defined, would be that the rights of the secured party in the case would be as if the State had no system. However, others would be in doubt as to whether they could safely rely on the same system.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Swine contract library.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Do I need to provide swine contract information?</E> Each packer, as defined in § 206.1, must provide information for each swine processing plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants, specified in the definition of packer in § 206.1.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">What existing or available contracts do I need to provide and when are they due?</E> Each packer must send, to the Packers and Stockyards Division (PSD), an example of each contract it currently has with a producer or producers or that is currently available at each plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that meets the definition of packer in § 206.1. This initial submission of example contracts is due to PSD on the first business day of the month following the determination that the plant has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants, specified in the definition of packer in § 206.1.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">What available contracts do I need to provide and when are they due?</E> After the initial submission, each packer must send PSD an example of each new contract it makes available to a producer or producers within 1 business day of the contract being made available at each plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that meets the definition of packer in § 206.1.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">What criteria do I use to select example contracts?</E> For purposes of distinguishing among contracts to determine which contracts may be represented by <PRTPAGE P="76"/>a single example, contracts will be considered to be the same if they are identical with respect to all of the following four example-contract criteria:</P>
          <P>(1) Base price or determination of base price;</P>
          <P>(2) Application of a ledger or accrual account (including the terms and conditions of the ledger or accrual account provision);</P>
          <P>(3) Carcass merit premium and discount schedules (including the determination of the lean percent or other merits of the carcass that are used to determine the amount of the premiums and discounts and how those premiums and discounts are applied); and</P>
          <P>(4) Use and amount of noncarcass merit premiums and discounts.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Where and how do I send my contracts?</E> Each packer may submit the example contracts, notifications required by this section, and Form P&amp;SP 342, Contract Submission Cover Sheet, by either of the following two methods:</P>
          <P>(1<E T="03">) Electronic report.</E> Example contracts and notifications required by this section may be submitted by electronic means. Electronic submission may be by any form of electronic transmission that has been determined to be acceptable to the Administrator. To obtain current options for acceptable methods to submit example contracts electronically, contact PSD through the Internet on the AMS website (<E T="03">https://www.ams.usda.gov</E>) or at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Printed report.</E> Each packer that chooses to submit printed example contracts and notifications must deliver the printed contracts and notifications to USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">What information from the swine contract library will be made available to the public?</E> PSD will summarize the information it has received on contract terms, including, but not limited to, base price determination and the schedules of premiums or discounts. PSD will make the information available by region and contract type, as defined in § 206.1, for public release 1 month after the initial submission of contracts. Geographic regions will be defined in such a manner to provide as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with section 251 of the Agricultural Marketing Act (7 U.S.C. 1636).</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">How can I review information from the swine contract library?</E> The information will be available on the Internet on the AMS website (<E T="03">https://www.ams.usda.gov</E>) and at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. The information will be updated as PSD receives information from packers.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">What do I need to do when a previously submitted example contract is no longer a valid example due to contract changes, expiration, or withdrawal?</E> Each packer must submit a new example contract when contract changes result in changes to any of the four example-contract criteria specified in paragraph (d) of this section and notify PSD if the new example contract replaces the previously submitted example contract. Each packer must notify AMS when an example contract no longer represents any existing or available contract (expired or withdrawn). Each packer must submit these example contracts and notifications within 1 business day of the change, expiration, or withdrawal.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Do I need to provide monthly reports?</E> Each packer, as defined in § 206.1, must provide information for each swine processing plant that it operates or at which it has swine slaughtered that has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants, specified in the definition of packer.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">When is the monthly report due?</E> Each packer must send a separate monthly report for each plant that has the slaughtering capacity, alone or in combination with other plants specified in the definition of packer in § 206.1. Each packer must deliver the report to the AMS Regional Office in Des Moines, Iowa, by the close of business on the 15th of each month, beginning at least 45 days after the initial submission of example contracts. If the 15th day of a month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, the monthly report is due no later than the <PRTPAGE P="77"/>close of the next business day following the 15th.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">What information do I need to provide in the monthly report?</E> The monthly report that each packer files must be reported on Form P&amp;SP-341, which will be available on the Internet on the AMS website (<E T="03">https://www.ams.usda.gov</E>) and at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309. In the monthly report, each packer must provide the following information:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Number of swine to be delivered under existing contracts.</E> Existing contracts are contracts the packer currently is using for the purchase of swine for slaughter at each plant. Each packer must provide monthly estimates of the number of swine committed to be delivered under all of its existing contracts (even if those contracts are not currently available for renewal or to additional producers) in each contract type as defined in § 206.1.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Available contracts.</E> Available contracts are the contracts the packer is currently making available to producers, or is making available for renewal to currently contracted producers, for the purchase of swine for slaughter at each plant. On the monthly report, a packer will indicate each contract type, as defined in § 206.1, that the packer is currently making available.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Estimates of committed swine.</E> Each packer must provide an estimate of the total number of swine committed under existing contracts for delivery to each plant for slaughter within each of the following 12 calendar months beginning with the 1st of the month immediately following the due date of the report. The estimate of total swine committed will be reported by contract type as defined in § 206.1.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Expansion clauses.</E> Any conditions or circumstances specified by clauses in any existing contracts that could result in an increase in the estimates specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Each packer will identify the expansion clauses in the monthly report by listing a code for the following conditions:</P>
          <P>(i) Clauses that allow for a range of the number of swine to be delivered.</P>
          <P>(ii) Clauses that require a greater number of swine to be delivered as the contract continues.</P>
          <P>(iii) Other clauses that provide for expansion in the numbers of swine to be delivered.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Maximum estimates of swine.</E> The packer's estimate of the maximum total number of swine that potentially could be delivered to each plant within each of the following 12 calendar months, if any or all of the types of expansion clauses identified in accordance with the requirement in paragraph (c)(4) of this section are executed. The estimate of maximum potential deliveries must be reported for all existing contracts by contract type as defined in § 206.1.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">What if a contract does not specify the number of swine committed?</E> To meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section, the packer must estimate expected and potential deliveries based on the best information available to the packer. Such information might include, for example, the producer's current and projected swine inventories and planned production.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">When do I change previously reported estimates?</E> Regardless of any estimates for a given future month that may have been previously reported, current estimates of deliveries reported as required by paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section must be based on the most accurate information available at the time each report is prepared.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Where and how do I send my monthly report?</E> Each packer must submit monthly reports required by this section by either of the following two methods:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Electronic report.</E> Information reported under this section may be reported by electronic means, to the maximum extent practicable. Electronic submission may be by any form of electronic transmission that has been determined to be acceptable to the Administrator. To obtain current options for acceptable methods to submit information electronically, contact PSD through the Internet on the AMS website (<E T="03">https://www.ams.usda.gov</E>) or at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.<PRTPAGE P="78"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Printed report.</E> Each packer may deliver its printed monthly report to USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">What information from monthly reports will be made available to the public and when and how will the information be made available to the public?</E> (1) <E T="03">Availability.</E> PSD will provide a monthly report of estimated deliveries by contract types as reported by packers in accordance with this section, for public release on the first business day of each month. The monthly reports will be available on the Internet on the AMS website (<E T="03">https://www.ams.usda.gov</E>) and at USDA, AMS, Suite 317, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Regions.</E> Information in the report will be aggregated and reported by geographic regions. Geographic regions will be defined in such a manner to provide as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with section 251 of the Agricultural Marketing Act (7 U.S.C. 1636) and may be modified from time to time.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Reported information.</E> The monthly report will provide the following information:</P>
          <P>(i) The existing contract types for each geographic region.</P>
          <P>(ii) The contract types currently being made available to additional producers or available for renewal to currently contracted producers in each geographic region.</P>
          <P>(iii) The sum of packers' reported estimates of the total number of swine committed by contract for delivery during the next 6 and 12 months beginning with the month the report is published. The report will indicate the number of swine committed by geographic reporting region and by contract type.</P>
          <P>(iv) The types of conditions or circumstances as reported by packers that could result in expansion in the numbers of swine to be delivered under the terms of expansion clauses in the contracts at any time during the following 12 calendar months.</P>
          <P>(v) The sum of packers' reported estimates of the maximum total number of swine that potentially could be delivered during each of the next 6 and 12 months if all expansion clauses in current contracts are executed. The report will indicate the sum of estimated maximum potential deliveries by geographic reporting region and by contract type.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Where and how do I file a waiver request?</E> The waiver request must be submitted in writing and include a statement that the packer does not procure swine using marketing agreements. The packer must send the waiver request to the PSD Regional Office in Des Moines, Iowa. If the waiver request is approved, PSD will inform the packer in writing that it has been granted a waiver for 12 months following the date of receipt of the waiver request unless the status of the packer changes during that year. The packer will be notified to submit the information required in this part if it begins using marketing agreements during the waiver period or if PSD determines that the packer utilizes marketing agreements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to:</P>
            <P>(1) The slaughtering by any individual of livestock of his own raising, and the preparation by him and transportation in commerce of the carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of such livestock exclusively for use by him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and employees;</P>

            <P>(2) The custom slaughter by any person of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats delivered by the owner thereof for such slaughter, and the preparation by such slaughterer and transportation in commerce of the carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of such livestock, exclusively for use, in the household of such owner, by him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and employees; nor to the custom preparation by any person of carcasses, parts thereof, meat or meat food products derived from the slaughter by any individual of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats of his own raising or from game animals, delivered by the owner thereof for such custom preparation, and transportation in commerce of such custom prepared articles, exclusively for use in the household of such owner, by him and members of his household and his nonpaying guests and employees: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the following requirements are met by such custom operator;</P>
            <P>(i) Establishments that conduct custom operations must be maintained and operated in accordance with the provisions of §§ 416.1 through 416.6, except for: § 416.2(g)(2) through (6) of this chapter, regarding water reuse and any provisions of part 416 of this chapter relating to inspection or supervision of specified activities or other action by a Program employee. If custom operations are conducted in an official establishment, however, all of the provisions of part 416 of this chapter of shall apply to those operations.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the custom operator prepares or handles any products for sale, they are kept separate and apart from the custom prepared products at all times while the latter are in his custody;</P>
            <P>(iii) The custom prepared products are plainly marked “Not for Sale” as provided in § 316.16 of this subchapter, immediately after being prepared and are kept so identified until delivered to the owner; and</P>
            <P>(iv) If exempted custom slaughtering or other preparation of products is conducted in an official establishment, all facilities and equipment in the official establishment used for such custom operations shall be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before they are used for preparing any products for sale.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The exempted custom prepared products shall be prepared and handled in accordance with the provisions of §§ 318.5, 318.6, 381.300 through 318.311 of this subchapter and § 424.21 of subchapter E, and shall not be adulterated as defined in paragraph 1(m) of the Act. The provisions of §§ 318.5, 318.6, and 318.300 through 318.311 related to inspection or supervision of specified activities or other action by an inspection program employee and the provisions of § 318.6(b)(9) and (10) shall not apply to the preparation and handling of such exempted products.</P>
            <P>(2) The exempted custom prepared products shall comply with the requirements of §§ 316.16 and 317.16 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(3) The custom operators claiming exemption under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall keep records, in addition to records otherwise required by part 320 of this subchapter, showing the numbers and kinds of livestock slaughtered on a custom basis, the quantities and types of products prepared on a custom basis, and the names and addresses of the owners of the livestock and products.</P>
            <P>(4) Articles capable of use as human food, resulting from the exempted custom slaughter or other preparation of products shall be promptly denatured or otherwise identified in accordance with § 325.13 of this subchapter and not removed from the establishment where the custom operations are conducted until so identified, unless they are delivered to the owner of the articles for use in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

            <P>(c) It has been determined that it is impracticable to provide inspection of <PRTPAGE P="93"/>the preparation of products at establishments in any unorganized Territory at which livestock are slaughtered or their products are prepared for distribution solely within such jurisdiction and that exempting such establishments from requirements of the Act for such inspections under the conditions stated in this section will otherwise facilitate enforcement of the Act. Therefore, such inspection requirements of the Act and of the regulations in this subchapter shall not apply at such establishments if they are operated in accordance with the regulations in part 416, §§ 416.1 through 416.5 of this chapter. However, the Administrator may refuse, withdraw, or modify any exemption under this paragraph when he determines in any specific case in accordance with the applicable rules of practice that such action is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to operations of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores and restaurants, when conducted at any retail store or restaurant or similar retail-type establishment for sale in normal retail quantities or service of such articles to consumers at such establishments.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Operations of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores and restaurants are the following:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Cutting up, slicing, and trimming carcasses, halves, quarters, or wholesale cuts into retail cuts such as steaks, chops, and roasts, and freezing such cuts;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Grinding and freezing products made from meat;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Curing, cooking, smoking, rendering or refining of livestock fat, or other preparation of products, except slaughtering or the retort processing of canned products;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) Breaking bulk shipments of products;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) Wrapping or rewrapping products.</P>
            <P>(ii) Any quantity or product purchased by a consumer from a particular retail supplier shall be deemed to be a normal retail quantity if the quantity so purchased does not in the aggregate exceed one-half carcass. The following amounts of product will be accepted as representing one-half carcass of the species identified:</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Only federally or State inspected and passed product is handled or used in the preparation of any product, except that product resulting from the custom slaughter or custom preparation of product may be handled or used in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) and (b) of this section but not for sale;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) No sale of product is made in excess of a normal retail quantity as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) The preparation of products for sale to household consumers is limited to traditional and usual operations as <PRTPAGE P="94"/>defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">f</E>) The preparation of products for sale to other than household consumers is limited to traditional and usual operations as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>), (<E T="03">b</E>), (<E T="03">d</E>), and (<E T="03">e</E>) of this section. (A retail store at which custom slaughtering or preparation of products is conducted is not thereby disqualified from exemption as a retail store under this paragraph (d).)</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Restaurants.</E> (<E T="03">a</E>) A restaurant is any establishment where:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Product is prepared only for sale or service in meals or as entrees directly to individual consumers at such establishments;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Only federally or State inspected and passed product or such product prepared at a retail store exempted under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section is handled or used in the preparation of any product;</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The definition of a restaurant includes a caterer which delivers or serves product in meals, or as entrees, only to individual consumers and otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) For purposes of this paragraph, operations conducted at a restaurant central kitchen facility shall be considered as being conducted at a restaurant if the restaurant central kitchen prepares meat or meat food products that are ready to eat when they leave such facility (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed, except that they may be reheated prior to serving if chilled during transportation), transported directly to a receiving restaurant by its own employees, without intervening transfer or storage, maintained in a safe, unadulterated condition during transportation, and served in meals or as entrees only to customers at restaurants, or through vending machines, owned or operated by the same person that owns or operates such facility, and which otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the requirements of §§ 320.1 through 320.4 of this subchapter apply to such facility. <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That the exempted facility may be subject to inspection requirements under the Act for as long as the Administrator deems necessary, if the Administrator determines that the sanitary conditions or practices of the facility or the processing procedures or methods at the facility are such that any of its meat or meat food products are rendered adulterated. When the Administrator has made such determination and subjected a restaurant central kitchen facility to such inspection requirements, the operator of such facility shall be afforded an opportunity to dispute the Administrator's determination in a hearing pursuant to rules of practice which will be adopted for this proceeding.</P>
            <P>(v) Similar retail-type establishment: Any establishment which is a combination retail store and restaurant; any delicatessen which meets the requirements for a retail store or restaurant as prescribed in paragraphs (d)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section; or other establishment as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.</P>
            <P>(vi) Consumer: Any household consumer, hotel, restaurant, or similar institution as determined by the Administrator in specific cases.</P>

            <P>(3) Whenever any complaint is received by the Administrator from any person alleging that any retail store claiming exemption under this paragraph (d), in any designated State or organized Territory that is identified under section 205 of the Act (as one that does not have or is not exercising adequate authority with respect to recordkeeping requirements) has been operated in violation of the conditions prescribed in this section for exemption, and the Administrator, upon investigation of the complaint, has reason to believe that any such violation has occurred, he shall so notify the operator of the retail store and afford him reasonable opportunity to present his views informally with respect to the matter. Thereafter, if the Administrator still has reason to believe that such a violation has occurred, and that <PRTPAGE P="95"/>a requirement that the operator keep records concerning the operations of the retail store would effectuate the purposes of the Act, the Administrator shall order the operator to maintain complete, accurate, and legible records of total monthly purchases and of total monthly sales of meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products, in terms of dollar values of the products involved. Such records shall separately show total sales to household consumers and total sales to other consumers and shall be maintained for the period prescribed in § 320.3 of this subchapter. If the operator maintains copies of bills of lading, receiving and shipping invoices, warehouse receipts, or similar documents which give the information required herein, additional records are not required by this subparagraph.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) The requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter for inspection of the preparation of products do not apply to meat pizzas containing meat food product ingredients which were prepared, inspected, and passed in a cured or cooked form as ready-to-eat (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed) in compliance with the requirements of the Act and these regulations; and the meat pizzas are to be served in public or private nonprofit institutions, provided that the meat pizzas are ready-to-eat (i.e., no further cooking or other preparation is needed, except that they may be reheated prior to serving if chilled during transportation), transported directly to the receiving institution by employees of the preparing firm, receiving institution, or a food service management company contracted to conduct food service at the public or private nonprofit institution, without intervening transfer or storage.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Experimentation: Intensity of inspection coverage.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Pursuant to the Processed Products Inspection Improvement Act of 1986, Title IV of the Futures Trading Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-641), in establishments preparing products at which inspection under the Act and regulations is required, the frequency with <PRTPAGE P="99"/>which and the manner in which meat food products made from livestock previously slaughtered in official establishments are examined and inspected by Program employees is to be based on considerations relevant to effective regulation of meat food products and protection of the health and welfare of consumers. In order to test procedures for use in making such determinations and, in particular, for determining whether and, is so, to what extent the intensity of inspection coverage exceeds that which should be considered necessary pursuant to section 6 of the Act, as amended by section 403(a) of the Futures Trading Act of 1986, the Administrator is initiating experimentation of a new system of inspection for reviewing the performance of establishments and for designing the supervision and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage. For the period of such experimentation, the Administrator shall identify establishments for review, and the frequency and the manner of inspection by Program employees shall be determined on the basis of the results of those reviews and be otherwise in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(b) The determinations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by the program and shall reflect evaluations of the performance and the characteristics and such establishments.</P>
            <P>(1) In assessing the performance of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:</P>
            <P>(i) The history of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the person conducting operations at such establishment or by anyone responsibly connected with the business conducting operations at such establishment, as “responsibly connected” is defined in section 401(g) of the Act,</P>
            <P>(ii) The competence of the person conducting operations at such establishment, as indicated by:</P>
            <P>(A) Knowledge of appropriate manufacturing practices and applicable regulatory requirements,</P>
            <P>(B) Demonstrated ability to apply such knowledge in a timely and consistent manner, and</P>
            <P>(C) Commitment to correcting deficiencies noted by Program employees and otherwise assuring compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and</P>
            <P>(iii) The procedures used in such establishment to control the production process, environment, and resulting product in order to assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.</P>
            <P>(2) In assessing the characteristics of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:</P>
            <P>(i) The complexity of the processing operation(s) conducted at such establishment,</P>
            <P>(ii) The frequency with which each such operation is conducted at such establishment,</P>
            <P>(iii) The volume of product resulting from each such operation at such establishment,</P>
            <P>(iv) Whether and to what extent slaughter operations also are conducted at such establishment,</P>
            <P>(v) What, if any, food products not regulated under this Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act also are prepared at such establishment, and</P>
            <P>(vi) The size of such establishment.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) For the period of experimentation described in paragraph (a) of this section, the frequency of inspection by Program employees of operations other than slaughter may be reduced in an establishment in which the procedures referred to therein are being tested if and only if the evaluation of the performance of such establishment described in paragraph (b)(1) indicates that there are:</P>
            <P>(i) No instances, documented in records compiled no earlier than 10 years before, of substantial and recent noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements (taking into account both the nature and frequency of any such noncompliance), and</P>
            <P>(ii) The competence and control procedures needed to assure and monitor compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.</P>

            <P>(2)(i) The frequency of Federal inspection and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage in any establishment in which the frequency of Federal inspection is reduced shall be based on:<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
            </P>

            <P>(a) Before the inspection is granted, each person conducting operations at an establishment subject to the Act, whether tenant, subsidiary, or landlord, shall make application therefor to the Administrator as provided for in this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Every application under this section shall be made on an official form furnished by the Program, available from any Regional Director identified in § 301.2(kkk) of this subchapter, and shall be completed to include all information requested. Trade names of the applicant for labeling purposes, shall be inserted in the appropriate blank in the application. Each applicant for inspection will be held responsible for compliance with the Act and the regulations in this subchapter if inspection is granted. Preparation of product and other operations at the establishment for which inspection is granted may be conducted only by the applicant named in the application.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Information to be furnished; grant or refusal of inspection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) FSIS shall give notice in writing to each applicant granted inspection and shall specify in the notice the establishment, including the limits of the establishment's premises, to which the grant pertains.</P>
            <P>(b) The Administrator is authorized to grant inspection upon his determination that the applicant and the establishment are eligible therefor and to refuse to grant inspection at any establishment if he determines that it does not meet the requirements of this part or the regulations in parts 305, 307, and part 416, §§ 416.1 through 416.6 of this chapter or that the applicant has not received approval of labeling and containers to be used at the establishment as required by the regulations in parts 316 and 317. Any application for inspection may be refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters in the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (84 Stat. 91), to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards. No grant of inspection can be issued after April 3, 1970 (the date of enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act), unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived because of failure <PRTPAGE P="101"/>or refusal of the State, interstate agency or the Secretary of the Interior to act on a request for certification within a reasonable period (which shall not exceed 1 year after receipt of such request).</P>
            <P>(2) However, certification is not initially required in connection with an application for inspection granted after April 3, 1970, for facilities existing or under construction on April 3, 1970, although certification for such facilities is required to be obtained within the 3-year period immediately following April 3, 1970. Failure to obtain such certification and meet the other requirements of subsection 21(b) prior to April 3, 1973, will result in the termination of inspection at such facilities on that date.</P>
            <FP>Further, any application for inspection pending on April 3, 1970, and granted within 1 year thereafter shall not require certification for 1 year following the grant of inspection but such grant of inspection shall terminate at the end of 1 year after its issuance unless prior thereto such certification has been obtained and the other requirements of subsection 21(b) are met.</FP>

            <P>(a) No operations requiring inspection shall be conducted except under the supervision of a Program employee. All slaughtering of animals and preparation of products shall be done with reasonable speed, considering the official establishment's facilities.</P>
            <P>(b) A shift is a regularly scheduled operating period, exclusive of mealtime. One lunch period is the only official authorized interruption in the inspector's tour of duty once it begins. Lunch periods may be 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or in any case may not exceed one hour in duration. Once established, the lunch period must remain relatively constant as to time and duration. Lunch periods for inspectors shall not, except as provided herein, occur prior to 4 hours after the beginning of scheduled operations nor later than 5 hours after operations begin. In plants where a company rest break of not less than 30 minutes is regularly observed, approximately midpoint between start of work and the lunch period, and the inspector is allowed this time to meet his personal needs, the lunch period may be scheduled as long as 5<FR>1/2</FR> hours after the beginning of scheduled operations.</P>

            <P>(c) Official establishments, importers, and exporters shall be provided inspection service, without charge, up to 8 consecutive hours per shift during the <PRTPAGE P="106"/>basic workweek subject to the provisions of § 307.5: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any additional shifts meet requirements as determined by the Administrator or his designee. The basic workweek shall consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days within the administrative workweek Sunday through Saturday, except that, when possible, the Department shall schedule the basic workweek so as to consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday. The 8-hour day excludes the lunch period but shall include activities deemed necessary by the Agency to fully carry out an inspection program, including the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to put on required gear and to walk to a work station; to prepare the work station; to return from a work station and remove required gear; to sharpen knives, if necessary; and to conduct duties scheduled by FSIS, including administrative duties. The Department may depart from the basic workweek in those cases where maintaining such a schedule would seriously handicap the Department in carrying out its function. These provisions are applicable to all official establishments except in certain cases as provided in § 318.4(h) of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Each official establishment shall submit a work schedule to the area supervisor for approval. In consideration of whether the approval of an establishment work schedule shall be given, the area supervisor shall take into account the efficient and effective use of inspection personnel. The work schedule must specify daily clock hours of operation and lunch periods for all departments of the establishment requiring inspection.</P>

            <P>(2) Establishments shall maintain consistent work schedules. Any request by an establishment for a change in its work schedule involving an addition or elimination of shifts shall be submitted to the area supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the proposed change. Frequent requests for change shall not be approved: <E T="03">Provided,</E> however, minor deviations from a daily operating schedule may be approved by the inspector in charge, if such request is received on the day preceding the day of change.</P>

            <P>(3) Request for inspection service outside an approved work schedule shall be made as early in the day as possible for overtime work to be performed within that same workday; or made prior to the end of the day's operation when such a request will result in overtime service at the start of the following day: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That an inspector may be recalled to his assignment after completion of his daily tour of duty under the provisions of § 307.6(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Safety requirements for electrical stimulating (EST) equipment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Electrical stimulating (EST) equipment is equipment that provides electric shock treatment to carcasses for the purpose of accelerating rigor mortis of facilitating blood removal. These provisions do not apply to electrical equipment used to stun and/or slaughter animals or to facilitate hide removal. Electrical stimulating equipment consists of two separate pieces—the control system and the applicator. The EST control system contains the circuitry to generate pulsed DC or AC voltage for stimulation and is separate from the equipment used to apply the voltage to the carcass. The voltage is applied by inserting a probe that penetrates the carcass or is inserted in the rectum, placing a clamp in the nose, a carcass rub-bar, a conveyor with energized surfaces traveling with the carcass, or any other acceptable method.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Safety requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Circuits, grounding.</E> Either a bonded grounding conductor shall lead from each section of the carcass rail within the stimulating enclosure to the service ground, or the secondary voltage (stimulating circuit) shall be insulated from the service ground. If the stimulating section of the carcass rail and carcass drive mechanisms are insulated from the service ground then the stimulating rail or the return path shall be electrically bonded to the transformer secondary to isolate the stimulation voltage.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Enclosure.</E> Electrical stimulation shall occur in an area that will prevent persons from contacting an energized surface. If the area is surrounded by physical barriers, the enclosure shall be either electrically grounded or it shall be made of materials that do not conduct electricity. The interior of the stimulating area shall be visible from the start switch so the operator can be assured that there is no person, equipment or material present that should not be there prior to starting the stimulating sequence. If light or sound beam sensors form the enclosure, the stimulating equipment shall be automatically shut off when the sensor signals are broken.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Mandatory Warning Devices and Signals.</E> The following warning devices or signals shall be installed at each opening to the stimulating area through which a person would normally enter:</P>
            <P>(i) A red light that flashes distinctly during the operating cycle of the stimulating equipment.</P>
            <P>(ii) An ANSI Z53.1-Color Code sign reading (a) “Danger Electrical Hazard” for stimulating voltage below 50 or (b) “Danger High Voltage” for stimulating voltage above 50.</P>
            <P>(iii) An emergency stop button.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Optional Warning Device—Horn or Bell.</E> If a warning horn or bell is installed, the signal shall be audible above background noises in the vicinity, and it shall sound for at least 1 second before each manual stimulation or before the carcass chain is started in an automatic system.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Operation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Training.</E> Only persons who have received safety instruction by the equipment manufacturer or designee may operate electrical stimulating equipment.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cleaning and Maintenance.</E> To prevent an electrical shock to personnel, the electricity supplied to the stimulating surfaces shall be locked-off when cleaning, mechanical inspection, maintenance or testing are performed.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Water.</E> To prevent an electrical shock, personnel shall not spray streams of water on energized carcasses or on energized stimulating surfaces.<PRTPAGE P="108"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Special provisions for manually operated equipment.</E> (1) Stimulating probes or clamps shall be stored in a sanitary container which is insulated with a material approved by the Administrator. <SU>1</SU>

            <P>(a) All livestock offered for slaughter in an official establishment shall be examined and inspected on the day of and before slaughter unless, because of unusual circumstances, prior arrangements acceptable to the Administrator have been made in specific cases by the circuit supervisor for such examination and inspection to be made on a different day before slaughter.</P>
            <P>(b) Such ante-mortem inspection shall be made on the premises of the establishment at which the livestock are offered for slaughter before the livestock shall be allowed to enter into any department of the establishment where they are to be slaughtered or dressed or in which edible products are handled. When the holding pens of an official establishment are located in a public stockyard and are reserved for the exclusive use of the establishment, such pens shall be regarded as part of the premises of that establishment and the operator of the establishment shall be responsible for compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this subchapter with respect to such pens.</P>

            <P>(a) Any livestock which, on ante-mortem inspection, do not clearly show, but are suspected of being affected with any disease or condition that, under part 311 of this subchapter, may cause condemnation of the carcass on post-mortem inspection, and any livestock which show, on ante-mortem inspection, any disease or condition that, under part 311 of this subchapter would cause condemnation of only part of the carcass on post-mortem inspection, shall be so handled as to retain its identity as a suspect until it is given final post-mortem inspection, when the carcass shall be marked and disposed of as provided in parts 310 and <PRTPAGE P="109"/>311 of this subchapter, or until it is disposed of as otherwise provided in this part.</P>
            <P>(b) All seriously crippled animals and non-ambulatory disabled livestock shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.1 of this subchapter unless they are required to be classed as condemned under § 309.3. Non-ambulatory disabled livestock are livestock that cannot rise from a recumbent position or that cannot walk, including, but not limited to, those with broken appendages, severed tendons or ligaments, nerve paralysis, fractured vertebral column, or metabolic conditions.</P>
            <P>(c) Livestock which have reacted to a test for leptospirosis, or anaplasmosis, but which show no symptoms of the disease, shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.10 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(d) Livestock which are known to have reacted to the tuberculin test shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.2 of this subchapter, except that livestock bearing an official “USDA Reactor” or similar State reactor tag shall not be tagged as U.S. Suspects.</P>
            <P>(e) Any cattle found on ante-mortem inspection to be affected with epithelioma of the eye or of the orbital region to a lesser extent than as described in § 309.6 shall be identified as a U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.12 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(f) Cattle found on ante-mortem inspection to be affected with anasarca to a lesser extent than as described in § 309.8 shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.8 of this subchapter or paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) Any livestock suspected of being affected with anasarca may be set apart and held for treatment under Program or other responsible official supervision approved by the area supervisor. If at the expiration of the treatment period the livestock upon examination is found to be free from disease, it may be released for any purpose. Otherwise, it shall be identified as U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.8 of this subchapter or condemned and disposed of as provided in § 309.8, whichever is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(h) All hogs suspected on ante-mortem inspection of being affected with swine erysipelas shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and disposed of as provided in § 311.5 of this subchapter or paragraph (i) of this section.</P>

If at the expiration of the treatment period the animal upon examination is found to be free from disease, it may be released for any purpose. Otherwise, it shall be identified as U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.5 of this subchapter, or condemned and disposed of as provided in § 309.13, whichever is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(j) Any livestock which is affected with vesicular exanthema or vesicular stomatitis, but which has recovered to the extent that the lesions are in process of healing, the temperature is within normal range, and the livestock shows a return to normal appetite and activity, shall be identified as U.S. Suspect and disposed of as provided in § 311.32 of this subchapter, except that if desired, such livestock may be set apart and held under supervision of a Program employee or other official designated by the area supervisor for treatment. If the livestock is set aside for treatment, the U.S. Suspect identification device will be removed by a Program employee, following such treatment, if the livestock is found to be free from any such disease. Such livestock found to be free from any such disease may be released for slaughter or for purposes other than slaughter, provided that in the latter instance, the operator of the official establishment or the owner of the animal shall first obtain permission from the local, State, or Federal livestock sanitary official having jurisdiction over the movement of such livestock.</P>

            <P>(k) Livestock which are offered for ante-mortem inspection under this part, and which are regarded by the inspector as immature, shall be identified as U.S. Suspects and, if slaughtered, the disposition of their carcasses shall be determined by the post-mortem findings in connection with the ante-mortem conditions. If not <PRTPAGE P="110"/>slaughtered as suspects, such livestock shall be held under supervision of a Program employee or other official designated by the area supervisor, and after sufficient development may be released for slaughter or may be released for any other purpose, provided they have not been exposed to any infectious or contagious disease. If such exposure occurs, permission should be obtained from the nearest Veterinary Services unit of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prior to release of such livestock.</P>
            <P>(l) Livestock previously condemned for listeriosis, if released for slaughter under § 309.13(b) shall be identified as a U.S. Suspect in accordance with § 309.13(c).</P>
            <P>(m) Each animal required by this part to be treated as a U.S. Suspect shall be identified as such by or under the supervision of a Program employee with an official device in accordance with § 309.18. No such device shall be removed except by a Program employee.</P>
            <P>(n) Each animal identified as a U.S. Suspect on ante-mortem inspection shall be set apart and shall be slaughtered separately from other livestock at that establishment unless disposed of as otherwise provided in this part.</P>
            <P>(o) Each animal identified as a U.S. Suspect on ante-mortem inspection, when presented for slaughter shall be accompanied with a form MP 402-2 on which the inspector at the establishment shall record the U.S. Suspect identification number and any other identifying tag numbers present and a brief description of the animal and of the disease or condition for which the animal was classed as a suspect, including its temperature when the temperature of such animal might have a bearing on the disposition of the carcass on post-mortem inspection.</P>
            <P>(p) When any animal identified as a U.S. Suspect is released for any purpose or reason, as provided in this part, the official identification device shall be removed only by a Program employee and he shall report his action to the area supervisor. When a suspect is to be released under the provisions of this part for a purpose other than slaughter, the operator of the official establishment or the owner of the animal shall first obtain permission for the removal of such animal from the local, State or Federal livestock sanitary official having jurisdiction.</P>

They shall be identified at official establishments as “U.S. Condemned.” These livestock may be held under the custody of a Program employee, or other official designated by the Administrator, until metabolic processes have reduced the residue sufficiently to make the tissues fit for human food and otherwise not adulterated. When the required time has elapsed, the livestock, if returned for slaughter, must be re-examined on ante-mortem inspection. To aid in determining the amount of residue present in the tissues, officials of the Program may permit the slaughter of any such livestock for the purpose of collecting tissues for analysis for the residue. Such analysis may include the use of inplant screening procedures designed to detect the presence of antimicrobial residues in any species of livestock.</P>
            <P>(b) All carcasses and edible organs and other parts thereof, in which are found any biological residues which render such articles adulterated, shall be marked as “U.S. Condemned” and disposed of in accordance with § 314.1 or § 314.3 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) A careful post-mortem examination and inspection shall be made of the carcasses and parts thereof of all livestock slaughtered at official establishments. Such inspection and examination shall be made at the time of slaughter unless, because of unusual circumstances, prior arrangements acceptable to the Administrator have been made in specific cases by the circuit supervisor for making such inspection and examination at a later time.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The staffing standards on the basis of the number of carcasses to be inspected per hour are outlined in the following tables. Standards for multiple inspector lines are based on inspectors rotating through the different types of inspection stations during each shift to equalize the workload. The inspector in charge shall have the authority to require the establishment to reduce slaughter line speeds where, in his judgment, the inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed at the current line speed because of particular deficiencies in carcass preparation and presentation by the plant at the higher speed, or because the health condition of the particular animals indicates a need for more extensive inspection.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cattle inspection.</E> For all cattle staffing standards, an “a” in the “Number of Inspectors by Stations” column means that one inspector performs the entire inspection procedure and a “b” means that one inspector performs the head and lower carcass inspection and a second inspector performs the viscera and upper carcass inspection. <SU>1</SU>

            <P>(A) Rules for determining adjusted maximum slaughter rates for single-inspector kills considering walking distance according to the table in this subdivision: Determine the distances the inspector actually walks between the points shown in columns 2 through 14 of the following table. For each column, determine the deduction figure opposite the appropriate number of feet in column 1. Compute the total of the deduction figures for columns 2 <PRTPAGE P="118"/>through 14. The adjusted maximum rate is the maximum rate in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus total of the deduction figures. If the resultant number is not a whole number, it must be rounded off to the next <E T="03">lowest</E> whole number.<PRTPAGE P="119"/>

            <P>(B) Rules for determining adjusted maximum slaughter rates for two-inspector kills considering walking distance according to the table in this subdivision: Determine the distances the inspectors actually walk between the points shown in columns 2 through 9 of the following table. Column 9 is used only if the condemned brands and tags the viscera inspector uses are kept at a location other than at the washbasin-sterilizer. For each column, determine the deduction figure opposite the appropriate number of feet in column 1. Compute the total of the deduction figures for columns 2 through 9. Divide this total by 2. The adjusted maximum rate is the maximum rate in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus the number calculated above. If the resultant number is not a whole number, it must be rounded off to the next <E T="03">lowest</E> whole number.<PRTPAGE P="121"/>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Swine inspection.</E> There are two systems of post-mortem inspection: The New Swine Slaughter Inspection System (NSIS), which may be used for market hogs, and the traditional inspection system, which may be used for all swine.</P>
            <P>(i) The NSIS may be used for market hogs if the official establishment requests to use it and meets or agrees to meet the requirements in 9 CFR 309.19 and § 310.26. The Administrator may permit establishments that slaughter classes of swine other than market hogs to use NSIS under a waiver from the provisions in 9 CFR 309.19 and § 310.26 as provided by 9 CFR 303.1(h). The Administrator also may permit establishments that slaughter both market hogs and other classes of swine to slaughter the market hogs under NSIS and slaughter the other classes of swine under traditional inspection.</P>

            <P>(ii) Traditional inspection shall be used for swine when NSIS is not used. The following inspection staffing standards are applicable to swine slaughter configurations operating under traditional inspection when NSIS is not used. The inspection standards for all slaughter lines are based upon the observation rather than palpation, at the viscera inspection station, of the spleen, liver, heart, lungs, and mediastinal lymph nodes. In addition, for one- and two-inspector lines under traditional inspection, the standards are based upon the distance walked (in feet) by the inspector between work stations; and for three or more inspector slaughter lines, upon the use of a mirror, as described in <PRTPAGE P="123"/>§ 307.2(m)(6) of this chapter, at the carcass inspection station. Although not required in a one- or two-inspector slaughter configuration, except in certain cases as determined by the inspection service, if a mirror is used, it must comply with the requirements of § 307.2(m)(6).</P>

            <P>(a) The head, tail, tongue, thymus gland, and all viscera of each slaughtered animal, and all blood and other parts of such animal to be used in the preparation of meat food products or medical products, shall be handled in such a manner as to identify them with the rest of the carcass and as being derived from the particular animal involved, until the post-mortem examination of the carcass and parts thereof has been completed. Such handling shall include the retention of ear tags, backtags, implants, and other identifying devices affixed to the animal, in such a way to relate them to the carcass until the post-mortem examination has been completed.</P>

            <P>(b) The official State-Federal Department backtag on any carcass shall:<PRTPAGE P="125"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1)(i) Be removed from the hide of the animal by an establishment employee and placed in a clear plastic bag. The bag containing the tag shall be affixed to the corresponding carcass.</P>
            <P>(ii) The bag containing the tag shall be removed from the carcass by an establishment employee and presented with the viscera to the Program inspector at the point where such inspector conducts the viscera inspection.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Brucellosis and tuberculosis ear tags, herd identification ear tags, sales tags, ear bangles, and similar identification devices shall be removed from the animal's hide or ear by an establishment employee and shall be placed in a clear plastic bag and affixed to the corresponding carcass.</P>
            <P>(ii) The bag containing the tag shall be removed from the carcass by an establishment employee and presented with the viscera to the Program inspector at the point where such inspector conducts the viscera inspection.</P>
            <P>(3) In cases where both types of devices described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are present on the same animal, both types may be placed in the same plastic bag or in two separate bags.</P>
            <P>(4) The circuit supervisor may allow the use of any alternate method proposed by the operator of an official establishment for handling the type of devices described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if such alternate method would provide a ready means of identifying a specific carcass with the corresponding devices by a Program inspector during the post-mortem inspection.</P>
            <P>(5) Disposition and use of identifying devices.</P>
            <P>(i) The official State-Federal Department backtags will be collected by a Program inspector and used to obtain traceback information necessary for proper disposition of the animal or carcass and otherwise handled according to instructions issued to the inspectors.</P>
            <P>(ii) The devices described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be collected by the Program inspector when required to obtain traceback information necessary for proper disposition of the animal or carcass and for controlling the slaughter of reactor animals. Devices not collected for these purposes shall be discarded after the post-mortem examination is complete.</P>
            <P>(6) Plastic bags used by the establishment for collecting identifying devices will be furnished by the Department.</P>

              <FTREF/> approved specifically for this purpose by the Administrator:</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> A list of disinfectants approved for this purpose is available upon request to the Scientific Services, Meat and Poultry Inspection, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.</P>
            </FTNT>

            <P>(i) A 5 percent solution of sodium hydroxide or commercial lye containing at least 94 percent of sodium hydroxide. The solution shall be freshly prepared immediately before use by dissolving 2<FR>1/2</FR> pounds of sodium hydroxide or lye in 5<FR>1/2</FR> gallons of hot water and shall be applied as near scalding hot as possible to be most effective. (Owing to the extremely caustic nature of sodium hydroxide solution, precautionary measures such as the wearing of rubber gloves and boots to protect the hands and feet, and goggles to protect the eyes, should be taken by those engaged in the disinfection process. It is also advisable to have an acid solution, <PRTPAGE P="127"/>such as vinegar, in readiness in case any of the sodium hydroxide solution should come in contact with any part of the body.)</P>
            <P>(ii) A solution of sodium hypochlorite containing approximately one-half of 1 percent (5,000 parts per million) of available chlorine. The solution shall be freshly prepared.</P>
            <P>(iii) When a disinfectant solution has been applied to equipment which will afterwards contact product, the equipment shall be rinsed with clean water before such contact.</P>
            <P>(2) In case anthrax infection is found in the hog slaughtering department, an immediate preliminary disinfection shall be made from the head-dropper's station to the point where the disease is detected and the affected carcasses shall be cut down from the rail and removed from the room. Upon completion of the slaughtering of the lot of hogs of which the anthrax-infected animals were a part, slaughtering operations shall cease, and a thorough cleanup and disinfection shall be made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the slaughter of the lot has not been completed by the close of the day on which anthrax was detected, the cleanup and disinfection shall not be deferred beyond the close of that day.</P>
            <P>(3) The first and indispensable precautionary step for persons who have handled anthrax material is thorough cleansing of the hands and arms with liquid soap and running hot water. It is important that this step be taken immediately after exposure, before vegetative anthrax organisms have had time to form spores. In the cleansing, a brush or other appropriate appliance shall be used to insure the removal of all contaminating material from under and about the fingernails. This process of cleansing is most effective when performed in repeated cycles of lathering and rinsing rather than in spending the same amount of time in scrubbing with a single lathering. After the hands have been cleansed thoroughly and rinsed free of soap, they may, if desired, be immersed for about 1 minute in a 1:1,000 solution of bichloride of mercury, followed by thorough rinsing in clean running water. Supplies of bichloride of mercury for the purpose must be held in the custody of the veterinary medical officer. (As a precautionary measure, all persons exposed to anthrax infection should report promptly any suspicious condition (sore or carbuncle) or symptom to a physician, in order that anti-anthrax serum or other treatment may be administered as indicated.)</P>

            <P>(a) Criteria for verifying process control; <E T="03">E. coli</E> testing. (1) Each official establishment that slaughters livestock must test for <E T="03">Escherichia coli</E> Biotype 1 (<E T="03">E.coli</E>) Establishments that slaughter more than one type of livestock or both livestock and poultry, shall test the type of livestock or poultry slaughtered in the greatest number. The establishment shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Collect samples in accordance with the sampling techniques, methodology, and frequency requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) Obtain analytic results in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Maintain records of such analytic results in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Sampling requirements.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Written procedures.</E> Each establishment shall prepare written specimen collection procedures which shall identify employees designated to collect samples, and shall address location(s) of sampling, how sampling randomness is achieved, and handling of the sample <PRTPAGE P="134"/>to ensure sample integrity. The written procedure shall be made available to FSIS upon request.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sample collection.</E> The establishment must collect samples from all chilled livestock carcasses, except those boned before chilling (hot-boned), which must be sampled after the final wash. Samples must be collected in the following manner;</P>
            <P>(A) For cattle, establishments must sponge or excise tissue from the flank, brisket and rump, except for hide-on calves, in which case establishments must take samples by sponging from inside the flank, inside the brisket, and inside the rump.</P>
            <P>(B) For sheep, goat, horse, mule, or other equine carcasses, establishments must sponge from the flank, brisket and rump, except for hide-on carcasses, in which case establishments must take samples by sponging from inside the flank, inside the brisket, and inside the rump.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Sampling frequency.</E> Slaughter establishments, except very low volume establishments as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, must take samples at a frequency proportional to the volume of production at the following rates:</P>
            <P>(A) Cattle, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and other equines: 1 test per 300 carcasses, but, a minimum of one sample during each week of operation.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Sampling frequency alternatives.</E> An establishment operating under a validated HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.2(b) of this chapter may substitute an alternative frequency for the frequency of sampling required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section if,</P>
            <P>(A) The alternative is an integral part of the establishment's verification procedures for its HACCP plan and,</P>
            <P>(B) FSIS does not determine, and notify the establishment in writing, that the alternative frequency is inadequate to verify the effectiveness of the establishment's processing controls.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Sampling in very low volume establishments.</E> (A) Very low volume establishments annually slaughter no more than 6,000 cattle, 6,000 sheep, 6,000 goats, 6,000 horses, mules or other equines, or a combination of livestock not exceeding 6,000 cattle and 20,000 total of all livestock. Very low volume establishments that collect samples by sponging shall collect at least one sample per week, starting the first full week of operation after June 1 of each year, and continue sampling at a minimum of once each week the establishment operates until June 1 of the following year or until 13 samples have been collected, whichever comes first. Very low volume establishments collecting samples by excising tissue from carcasses shall collect one sample per week, starting the first full week of operation after June 1 of each year, and continue sampling at a minimum of once each week the establishment operates until one series of 13 tests meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(B) Upon the establishment's meeting requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(A) of this section, weekly sampling and testing is optional, unless changes are made in establishment facilities, equipment, personnel or procedures that may affect the adequacy of existing process control measures, as determined by the establishment or FSIS. FSIS determinations that changes have been made requiring resumption of weekly testing shall be provided to the establishment in writing.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Analysis of samples.</E> Laboratories may use any quantitative method for analysis of <E T="03">E. coli</E> that is approved as an AOAC Official Method of the AOAC International (formerly the Association of Official Analytical Chemists) <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> or approved and published by a scientific body and based on the results of a collaborative trial conducted in accordance with an internationally recognized protocol on collaborative trials and compared against the three tube Most Probable Number (MPN) method and agreeing with the 95 percent upper and lower confidence limit of the appropriate MPN index.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disposal of diseased or otherwise adulterated carcasses and parts; general.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The carcasses or parts of carcasses of all animals slaughtered at an official establishment and found at the time of slaughter or at any subsequent inspection to be affected with any of the diseases or conditions named in this part shall be disposed of according to the section pertaining to the disease <PRTPAGE P="138"/>or condition: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no product shall be passed for human food under any such section unless it is found to be otherwise not adulterated. Products passed for cooking or refrigeration under this part must be so handled at the official establishment where they are initially prepared unless they are moved to another official establishment for such handling or in the case of products passed for refrigeration are moved for such refrigeration to a freezing facility approved by the Administrator in specific cases: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That when so moved the products are shipped in containers sealed in accordance with § 318.10(c) of this subchapter or in a sealed means of conveyance as provided in § 325.7 of this subchapter. Owning to the fact that it is impracticable to formulate rules covering every case and to designate at just what stage a disease process or a condition results in adulteration of a product, the decision as to the disposal of all carcasses, organs, or other parts not specifically covered in this part shall be left to the veterinary medical officer. The veterinary medical officer shall exercise his judgment regarding the disposition of all carcasses or parts of carcasses under this part in a manner which will insure that only wholesome, unadulterated product is passed for human food.</P>
            <P>(b) In cases of doubt as to a condition, a disease, or the cause of a condition, or to confirm a diagnosis, representative specimens of the affected tissues, properly prepared and packaged, shall be sent for examination to one of the laboratories of the Biological Control Section of the Program.</P>

            <P>The following principles shall apply to the disposition of carcasses of livestock based on the difference in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in swine, cattle, sheep, goats, and equines.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Carcasses condemned.</E> The entire carcass of swine, cattle, sheep, goats, and equines shall be condemned if any of the following conditions occur:</P>
            <P>(1) When the lesions of tuberculosis are generalized (tuberculosis is considered to be generalized when the lesions are distributed in a manner made possible only by entry of the bacilli into the systemic circulation);</P>
            <P>(2) When on ante mortem inspection the animal is observed to have a fever found to be associated with an active tuberculosis lesion on post mortem inspection;</P>
            <P>(3) When there is an associated cachexia;</P>
            <P>(4) When a tuberculosis lesion is found in any muscle or intermuscular tissue, or bone, or joint, or abdominal organ (excluding the gastrointestinal tract) or in any lymph node as a result of draining a muscle, bone, joint, or abdominal organ (excluding the gastrointestinal tract);</P>
            <P>(5) When the lesions are extensive in tissues of either the thoracic or the abdominal cavity;</P>
            <P>(6) When the lesions are multiple, acute, and actively progressive; or</P>
            <P>(7) When the character or extent of the lesions otherwise is not indicative of a localized condition.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Organs or other parts condemned.</E> An organ or other part of a swine, cattle, sheep, goat, or equine carcass affected by localized tuberculosis shall be condemned when it contains lesions of tuberculosis or when the corresponding lymph node contains lesions of tuberculosis.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Carcasses of cattle passed without restriction for human food.</E> Carcasses of cattle may be passed without restriction for human food only when the carcass of an animal not identified as a reactor to a tuberculin test administered by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, State, or accredited veterinarian <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> is found free of tuberculosis lesions during postmortem inspection.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Portions of carcasses and carcasses of cattle passed for cooking.</E> (1) When a cattle carcass reveals a tuberculosis lesion or lesions not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions <PRTPAGE P="139"/>are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.</P>
            <P>(2) When the carcass of a cattle identified as a reactor to a tuberculin test administered by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, State or accredited veterinarian is found free of lesions of tuberculosis, the carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Portions of carcasses and carcasses of swine passed without restriction for human food.</E> Swine carcasses found free of tuberculosis lesions during post mortem inspection may be passed for human food without restriction. When tuberculosis lesions in any swine carcass are localized and confined to one primary seat of infection, such as the cervical lymph nodes, the mesenteric lymph nodes, or the mediastinal lymph nodes, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for human food without restriction after the affected organ or other part is condemned.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Portions of carcasses of swine passed for cooking.</E> When the carcass of any swine reveals lesions more severe or more numerous than those described in paragraph (e) of this section, but not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portions of such carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines passed without restriction for human food.</E> Carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines may be passed without restriction for human food only if found free of tuberculosis lesions during post mortem inspection.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Portions of carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines passed for cooking.</E> If a carcass of any sheep, goat, or equine reveals a tuberculosis lesion or lesions that are not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.</P>

            <P>(b) Inconclusive but suspicious symptoms of hog cholera observed during the ante-mortem inspection of a U.S. suspect shall be duly considered in connection with post-mortem findings and when the carcass of such a suspect shows lesions in the kidneys and the lymph nodes which resemble lesions of hog cholera, they shall be regarded as those of hog cholera and the carcass shall be condemned.</P>
            <P>(c) When lesions resembling those of hog cholera occur in kidneys and lymph nodes of carcasses of hogs which appeared normal on ante-mortem inspection, further inspection of such carcasses shall be made for corroborative lesions. If on such further inspection, characteristic lesions of hog cholera are found in some organ or tissue in addition to those in the kidneys or in the lymph nodes or in both, then all lesions shall be regarded as those of hog cholera and the carcass shall be condemned. Immediate notification shall be given by the inspector to the official in the Veterinary Services unit of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service who has responsibility for control of swine diseases in the State where the swine are located.</P>

            <P>From the standpoint of meat inspection, necrobacillosis may be regarded as a local infection at the beginning, and carcasses in which the lesions are localized may be passed for human food if in a good state of nutrition, after those portions affected with necrotic lesions are removed and condemned. However, when emaciation, cloudy swelling of the parenchymatous tissue of organs or enlargement of the lymph nodes is associated with the infection, it is evident that the disease has progressed beyond the condition of localization to a state of toxemia, and the entire carcass shall therefore be condemned as both unwholesome and noxious. Pyemia or septicemia may intervene as a complication of the local necrosis, and when present the carcass shall be condemned in accordance with § 311.16.</P>

            <P>(1) Carcasses of cattle displaying lesions of cysticercus bovis shall be condemned if the infestation is extensive or if the musculature is edematous or discolored. Carcasses shall be considered extensively infested if in addition to finding lesions in at least two of the usual inspection sites, namely the heart, diaphragm and its pillars, muscles of mastication, esophagus, tongue, and musculature exposed during normal dressing operations, they are found in at least two of the sites exposed by (i) an incision made into each round exposing the musculature in cross section, and (ii) a transverse incision into each forelimb commencing 2 or 3 inches above the point of the olecranon and extending to the humerus.</P>

            <P>(2) Carcasses of cattle showing one or more tapeworm lesions of cysticercus bovis but not so extensive as indicated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as determined by a careful examination, including examination of, but not limited to, the heart, diaphragm and its pillars, muscles of mastication, esophagus, tongue, and musculature exposed during normal dressing operations, may be passed for human food after removal and condemnation of the lesions with surrounding tissues: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the carcasses, appropriately identified by retained tags, are held in cold storage under positive control of a USDA Food Inspector at a temperature not higher than 15 °F. continuously for a period of not less than 10 days, or in the case of boned meat derived from such carcasses, the meat, when in boxes, tierces, or other containers, appropriately identified by retained tags, is held under positive control of a Program Inspector at a temperature of not higher than 15 °F. continuously for a period of not less than 20 days. As an alternative to retention in cold storage as provided in this subparagraph, such carcasses and meat may be heated throughout to a temperature of at least 140 °F. under positive control of a Program Inspector.</P>
            <P>(b) Edible viscera and offal shall be disposed of in the same manner as the rest of the carcass from which they were derived unless any lesion of cysticercus bovis is found in these byproducts, in which case they shall be condemned.</P>

If an organ or other part of a carcass shows numerous lesions caused by parasites, or if the character of the infestation is such that complete extirpation of the parasitic infestation or invasion renders the part in any way unfit for human <PRTPAGE P="144"/>food, the affected part shall be condemned. If parasites are found to be distributed in a carcass in such a manner or to be of such character that their removal and the removal of the lesions caused by them is impracticable, no part of the carcass shall be passed for human food. If the infestation is excessive, the carcass shall be condemned. If the infestation is moderate, the carcass may be passed for cooking, but in case such carcass is not cooked as required by part 315 of this subchapter, it shall be condemned.</P>

            <P>(b) In the case of sheep carcasses affected with tapeworm cysts (Cysticercus ovis, so-called sheep measles, not transmissible to man), such carcasses may be passed for human food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if, upon the final inspection of sheep carcasses retained on account of measles, the total number of cysts found embedded in muscular tissue, or in immediate relation with muscular tissue, excluding the heart, exceeds five, the entire carcass shall be condemned, or such carcass shall be heated throughout to a temperature of at least 140 °F. After removal and condemnation of all affected portions.</P>
            <P>(c) Carcasses found infested with gid bladder-worms (Coenurus cerebralis, Multiceps multiceps) may be passed for human food after condemnation of the affected organ (brain or spinal cord).</P>
            <P>(d) Organs or other parts of carcasses infested with hydatid cysts (echinococus) shall be condemned.</P>

If all parts are not so kept for inspection, the carcass shall be condemned. If, on inspection of a carcass slaughtered in the absence of an inspector, any lesion or other evidence is found indicating that the animal was sick or diseased, or affected with any other condition requiring condemnation of the animal on ante-mortem inspection, or if there is lacking evidence of the condition which rendered emergency slaughter necessary, the carcass shall be condemned.

            <SUBJECT>Chemical; carbon dioxide.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The slaughtering of sheep, calves and swine with the use of carbon dioxide gas and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Administration of gas, required effect; handling.</E> (1) The carbon dioxide gas shall be administered in a chamber in accordance with this section so as to produce surgical anesthesia in the animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animals shall be exposed to the carbon dioxide gas in a way that will accomplish the anesthesia quickly and calmly, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. In swine, carbon dioxide may be administered to induce death in the animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut.</P>
            <P>(2) The driving or conveying of the animals to the carbon dioxide chamber shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the anesthesia chamber is essential since the induction, or early phase, of anesthesia is less violent with docile animals. Among other things this requires that, in driving animals to the anesthesia chamber, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.</P>
            <P>(3) On emerging from the carbon dioxide tunnel, the animals shall be in a state of surgical anesthesia and shall remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking, and bleeding, except for swine in which death has been induced by the administration of carbon dioxide. Asphyxia or death from any cause shall not be produced in animals before bleeding, except for swine in which death has been induced by the administration of carbon dioxide.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Facilities and procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirements for gas chambers and auxiliary equipment; operator.</E> (i) The carbon dioxide gas shall be administered in a tunnel which is designed to permit the effective exposure of the animal. Two types of tunnels, based on <PRTPAGE P="152"/>the same principle, are in common use for carbon dioxide anesthesia. They are the “U” type tunnel and the “Straight Line” type tunnel, and are based on the principle that carbon dioxide gas has a higher specific gravity than air. The tunnels are open at both ends for entry and exit of animals and have a depressed central section. Anesthetizing, or, in the case of swine, death-inducing, carbon dioxide concentrations are maintained in the central sections of the tunnels. Effective anaesthetization is produced in these central sections. Animals are driven from holding pens through pathways constructed of large-diameter pipe or smooth metal and onto continuous conveyor devices that move the animals through the tunnels. The animals are either compartmentalized on the conveyors by mechanical impellers synchronized with the conveyor or they are otherwise prevented from crowding. While impellers are used to compartmentalize the animals, mechanically or manually operated gates are used to move the animals onto the conveyors. Surgically anaesthetized animals, or killed swine, are moved out of the tunnels by the same continuous conveyors that moved them into and through the carbon dioxide gas.</P>
            <P>(ii) Flow of animals into and through the carbon dioxide chamber is dependent on one operator. The operation or stoppage of the conveyor is entirely dependent upon this operator. It is necessary that he be skilled, attentive, and aware of his responsibility. Overdosages and death of animals can be brought about by carelessness of this individual.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special requirements for gas chamber and auxiliary equipment.</E> The ability of anesthetizing equipment to perform with maximum efficiency is dependent on its proper design and efficient mechanical operation. Pathways, compartments, gas chambers, and all other equipment used must be designed to accommodate properly the species of animals being anesthetized. They shall be free from pain-producing restraining devices. Injury of animals must be prevented by the elimination of sharp projections or exposed wheels or gears. There shall be no unnecessary holes, spaces or openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Impellers or other devices designed to mechanically move or drive animals or otherwise keep them in motion or compartmentalized shall be constructed of flexible or well padded rigid material. Power activated gates designed for constant flow of animals to anesthetizing equipment shall be so fabricated that they will not cause injury. All equipment involved in anesthetizing animals shall be maintained in good repair.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Gas.</E> Maintenance of a uniform carbon dioxide concentration and distribution in the anesthesia chamber is a vital aspect of producing surgical anesthesia. This may be assured by reasonably accurate instruments which sample and analyze carbon dioxide gas concentration within the chamber throughout anesthetizing operations. Gas concentration shall be maintained uniform so that the degree of anesthesia in exposed animals will be constant. Carbon dioxide gas supplied to anesthesia chambers may be from controlled reduction of solid carbon dioxide or from a controlled liquid source. In either case the carbon dioxide shall be supplied at a rate sufficient to anesthetize adequately and uniformly the number of animals passing through the chamber. Sampling of gas for analysis shall be made from a representative place or places within the chamber and on a continuing basis. Gas concentrations and exposure time shall be graphically recorded throughout each day's operation. Neither carbon dioxide nor atmospheric air used in the anesthesia chambers shall contain noxious or irritating gases. Each day before equipment is used for anesthetizing animals, proper care shall be taken to mix adequately the gas and air within the chamber. All gas producing and control equipment shall be maintained in good repair and all indicators, instruments, and measuring devices must be available for inspection by Program inspectors during anesthetizing operations and at other times. An exhaust system must be provided so that, in case of equipment failure, non-uniform carbon dioxide concentrations in the <PRTPAGE P="153"/>gas tunnel or contamination of the ambient air of the establishment will be prevented.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Mechanical; captive bolt.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The slaughtering of sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, horses, mules, and other equines by using captive bolt stunners and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application of stunners, required effect; handling.</E> (1) The captive bolt stunners shall be applied to the livestock in accordance with this section so as to produce immediate unconsciousness in the animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animals shall be stunned in such a manner that they will be rendered unconscious with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.</P>
            <P>(2) The driving of the animals to the stunning area shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the stunning areas is essential since accurate placement of stunning equipment is difficult on nervous or injured animals. Among other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the stunning areas, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.</P>
            <P>(3) Immediately after the stunning blow is delivered the animals shall be in a state of complete unconsciousness and remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking and bleeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Facilities and procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirements for stunning facilities; operator.</E> (i) Acceptable captive bolt stunning instruments may be either skull penetrating or nonpenetrating. The latter type is also described as a concussion or mushroom type stunner. Penetrating instruments on detonation deliver bolts of varying diameters and lengths through the skull and into the brain. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by physical brain destruction and a combination of changes in intracranial pressure and acceleration concussion. Nonpenetrating or mushroom stunners on detonation deliver a bolt with a flattened circular head against the external surface of the animal's head over the brain. Diameter of the striking surface of the stunner may vary as conditions require. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by a combination of acceleration concussion and changes in intracranial pressures. A combination instrument utilizing both penetrating and nonpenetrating principles is acceptable. Energizing of instruments may be accomplished by detonation of measured charges of gunpowder or accurately controlled compressed air. Captive bolts shall be of such size and design that, when properly positioned and activated, immediate unconsciousness is produced.</P>
            <P>(ii) To assure uniform unconsciousness with every blow, compressed air devices must be equipped to deliver the necessary constant air pressure and must have accurate, constantly operating air pressure gauges. Gauges must be easily read and conveniently located for use by the stunning operator and the inspector. For purposes of protecting employees, inspectors, and others, it is desirable that any stunning device be equipped with safety features to prevent injuries from accidental discharge. Stunning instruments must be maintained in good repair.</P>

            <P>(iii) The stunning area shall be so designed and constructed as to limit the free movements of animals sufficiently to allow the operator to locate the stunning blow with a high degree of accuracy. All chutes, alleys, gates and restraining mechanisms between and including holding pens and stunning areas shall be free from pain-producing features such as exposed bolt ends, loose boards, splintered or broken planking, and protruding sharp metal of any kind. There shall be no unnecessary holes or other openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Overhead drop gates shall be suitably covered on the bottom edge to prevent injury on contact with animals. Roughened or cleated cement shall be used as flooring in chutes leading to stunning areas to reduce falls of animals. Chutes, alleys, and stunning areas <PRTPAGE P="154"/>shall be so designed that they will comfortably accommodate the kinds of animals to be stunned.</P>
            <P>(iv) The stunning operation is an exacting procedure and requires a well-trained and experienced operator. He must be able to accurately place the stunning instrument to produce immediate unconsciousness. He must use the correct detonating charge with regard to kind, breed, size, age, and sex of the animal to produce the desired results.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special requirements and prohibitions.</E> (i) Choice of instrument and force required to produce immediate unconsciousness varies, depending on kind, breed, size, age, and sex of the animal. Young swine, lambs, and calves usually require less stunning force than mature animals of the same kind. Bulls, rams, and boars usually require skull penetration to produce immediate unconsciousness. Charges suitable for smaller kinds of livestock such as swine or for young animals are not acceptably interchanged for use on larger kinds or older livestock, respectively.</P>
            <P>(ii) Captive bolt stunners that deliberately inject compressed air into the cranium at the end of the penetration cycle shall not be used to stun cattle.</P>

            <P>The slaughtering of cattle, calves, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines by shooting with firearms and the handling in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Utilization of firearms, required effect; handling.</E> (1) The firearms shall be employed in the delivery of a bullet or projectile into the animal in accordance with this section so as to produce immediate unconsciousness in the animal by a single shot before it is shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The animal shall be shot in such a manner that they will be rendered unconscious with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.</P>
            <P>(2) The driving of the animals to the shooting areas shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the shooting area is essential since accurate placement of the bullet is difficult in case of nervous or injured animals. Among other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the shooting areas, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.</P>
            <P>(3) Immediately after the firearm is discharged and the projectile is delivered, the animal shall be in a state of complete unconsciousness and remain in this condition throughout shackling, sticking and bleeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Facilities and procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirements for shooting facilities; operator.</E> (i) On discharge, acceptable firearms dispatch free projectiles or bullets of varying sizes and diameters through the skull and into the brain. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by a combination of physical brain destruction and changes in intracranial pressure. Caliber of firearms shall be such that when properly aimed and discharged, the projectile produces immediate unconsciousness.</P>
            <P>(ii) To assure uniform unconsciousness of the animal with every discharge where small-bore firearms are employed, it is necessary to use one of the following type projectiles: Hollow pointed bullets; frangible iron plastic composition bullets; or powdered iron missiles. When powdered iron missiles are used, the firearms shall be in close proximity with the skull of the animal when fired. Firearms must be maintained in good repair. For purposes of protecting employees, inspectors and others, it is desirable that all firearms be equipped with safety devices to prevent injuries from accidental discharge. Aiming and discharging of firearms should be directed away from operating areas.</P>
            <P>(iii) The provisions contained in § 313.15(b)(1)(iii) with respect to the stunning area also apply to the shooting area.</P>

            <P>(iv) The shooting operation is an exacting procedure and requires a well-trained and experienced operator. He must be able to accurately direct the projectile to produce immediate unconsciousness. He must use the correct caliber firearm, powder charge and <PRTPAGE P="155"/>type of ammunition to produce the desired results.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special requirements.</E> Choice of firearms and ammunition with respect to caliber and choice of powder charge required to produce immediate unconsciousness of the animal may vary depending on age and sex of the animal. In the case of bulls, rams, and boars, small bore firearms may be used provided they are able to produce immediate unconsciousness of the animals. Small bore firearms are usually effective for stunning other cattle, sheep, swine, and goats, and calves, horses, and mules.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Administration of electric current, required effect; handling.</E> (1) The electric current shall be administered so as to produce, at a minimum, surgical anesthesia, i.e., a state where the animal feels no painful sensation. The animals shall be either stunned or killed before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. They shall be exposed to the electric current in a way that will accomplish the desired result quickly and effectively, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.</P>
            <P>(2) The driving or conveying of the animals to the place of application of electric current shall be done with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the place of application is essential to ensure rapid and effective insensibility. Among other things, this requires that, in driving animals to the place of application, electrical equipment be used as little as possible and with the lowest effective voltage.</P>
            <P>(3) The quality and location of the electrical shock shall be such as to produce immediate insensibility to pain in the exposed animal.</P>
            <P>(4) The stunned animal shall remain in a state of surgical anesthesia through shackling, sticking, and bleeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Facilities and procedures; operator</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirements for operator.</E> It is necessary that the operator of electric current application equipment be skilled, attentive, and aware of his or her responsibility.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special requirements for electric current application equipment.</E> The ability of electric current equipment to perform with maximum efficiency is dependent on its proper design and efficient mechanical operation. Pathways, compartments, current applicators, and all other equipment used must be designed to properly accommodate the species of animals being anesthetized. Animals shall be free from pain-producing restraining devices. Injury of animals must be prevented by the elimination of sharp projections or exposed wheels or gears. There shall be no unnecessary holes, spaces or openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Impellers or other devices designed to mechanically move or drive animals or otherwise keep them in motion or compartmentalized shall be constructed of flexible or padded material. Power activated gates designed for constant flow of animals shall be so fabricated that they will not cause injury. All equipment used to apply and control the electrical current shall be maintained in good repair, and all indicators, instruments, and measuring devices shall be available for inspection by Program inspectors during the operation and at other times.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Electric current.</E> Each animal shall be given a sufficient application of electric current to ensure surgical anesthesia throughout the bleeding operation. Suitable timing, voltage and current control devices shall be used to ensure that each animal receives the necessary electrical charge to produce immediate unconsciousness. The current shall be applied so as to avoid the production of hemorrhages or other tissue changes which could interfere with inspection procedures.</P>

            <P>When an inspector observes an incident of inhumane slaughter or handling in connection with slaughter, he/she shall inform the establishment operator of the incident and request that the operator take the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence. If the establishment operator fails to take such action or fails to promptly provide the inspector with satisfactory assurances that such action will be taken, the inspector shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(a) If the cause of inhumane treatment is the result of facility deficiencies, disrepair, or equipment breakdown, the inspector shall attach a “U.S. Rejected” tag thereto. No equipment, alleyway, pen or compartment so tagged shall be used until made acceptable to the inspector. The tag shall not be removed by anyone other than an inspector. All livestock slaughtered prior to such tagging may be dressed, processed, or prepared under inspection.</P>
            <P>(b) If the cause of inhumane treatment is the result of establishment employee actions in the handling or moving of livestock, the inspector shall attach a “U.S. Rejected” tag to the alleyways leading to the stunning area. After the tagging of the alleyway, no more livestock shall be moved to the stunning area until the inspector receives satisfactory assurances from the establishment operator that there will not be a recurrence. The tag shall not be removed by anyone other than an inspector. All livestock slaughtered prior to the tagging may be dressed, processed, or prepared under inspection.</P>
            <P>(c) If the cause of inhumane treatment is the result of improper stunning, the inspector shall attach a “U.S. Rejected” tag to the stunning area. Stunning procedures shall not be resumed until the inspector receives satisfactory assurances from the establishment operator that there will not be a recurrence. The tag shall not be removed by anyone other than an inspector. All livestock slaughtered prior to such tagging may be dressed, processed, or prepared under inspection.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disposition of condemned products at official establishments having tanking facilities; sealing of tanks.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Carcasses, parts of carcasses, and other products condemned at official establishments having facilities for tanking shall, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or elsewhere in this part, be disposed of by tanking as follows:</P>

            <P>(1) The lower opening of the tank shall first be sealed securely by a Program employee, except when permanently connected with a blow line; then the condemned products shall be placed in the tank in his presence, after which the upper opening shall also be sealed <PRTPAGE P="157"/>securely by such employee, who shall then see that the contents of the tank are subjected to sufficient heating for sufficient time to effectively destroy the contents for human food purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) The use of equipment such as crushers or hashers for pretanking preparation of condemned products in the inedible products department has been found to give inedible character and appearance to the material. Accordingly, if condemned products are so crushed or hashed, conveying systems, rendering tanks, and other equipment used in the further handling of crushed or hashed material need not be locked or sealed during the tanking operations. If the rendering tanks or other equipment contain condemned material not so crushed or hashed, the equipment shall be sealed as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the crushed or hashed material is not rendered in the establishment where produced, it shall be denatured as provided for in § 314.3 before leaving such establishment.</P>
            <P>(b) The seals of tanks shall be broken only by a Program employee and only after the contents of the tanks have been treated as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The rendered fat derived from condemned material shall be held until a Program employee shall have had an opportunity to determine whether it conforms with the requirements of this section. Samples shall be taken by Program employees as often as is necessary to determine whether the rendered fat is effectually denatured.</P>
            <P>(c) Carcasses of animals condemned under § 309.3 of this subchapter may be disposed of as provided in § 314.3, in lieu of tanking, with the approval of the inspector.</P>

            <P>Carcasses and parts passed for cooking may be rendered into lard in accordance with § 319.702 of this subchapter or rendered into tallow, provided such rendering is done in the following manner:</P>

            <P>(a) When closed rendering equipment is used, the lower opening, except when permanently connected with a blowline, shall first be sealed securely by a Program employee; then the carcasses or parts shall be placed in such equipment in his presence, after which the upper opening shall be securely sealed by such employee. When the product passed for cooking in the tank does not consist of a carcass or whole primal part, the requirements for sealing shall be at the discretion of the circuit supervisor. Such carcasses and parts shall be cooked for a time sufficient to render them effectually into lard or tallow, provided all parts of the products are heated to a temperature <PRTPAGE P="160"/>not lower than 170 °F. for a period of not less than 30 minutes.</P>
            <P>(b) At establishments not equipped with closed rendering equipment for rendering carcasses and parts passed for cooking into lard and tallow, such carcasses or parts may be rendered in open kettles under the direct supervision of a Program employee. Such rendering shall be done during regular hours of work and in compliance with the requirements as to temperature and time specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Wrappings of dressed carcasses and primal parts in an unprocessed state, bearing the official inspection legend, if such wrappings are intended solely to protect the product against soiling or excessive drying during transportation or storage, and the wrappings bear no information except company brand names, trade marks, or code numbers which do not include any information required by § 317.2;</P>
              <P>(2) Uncolored transparent coverings, such as cellophane, which bear no written, printed, or graphic matter and which enclose any unpackaged or packaged product bearing all markings required by part 316 of this subchapter which are clearly legible through such coverings;</P>

              <P>(b) Any word, statement, or other information required by this part to appear on the label must be prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. In order to meet this requirement, such information must appear on the principal display panel except as otherwise permitted in this part. Except as provided in § 317.7, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in the case of products distributed solely in Puerto Rico, Spanish may be substituted for English for all printed matter except the USDA inspection legend.</P>

              <P>(1) The name of the product, which in the case of a product which purports to be or is represented as a product for which a definition and standard of identity or composition is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter, shall be the name of the food specified in the standard, and in the case of any other product shall be the common or usual name of the food, if any there be, and if there is none, a truthful descriptive designation, as prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section;<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If the product is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the word “ingredients” followed by a list of the ingredients as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section;</P>
              <P>(3) The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor for whom the product is prepared, as prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section;</P>

              <P>(6) Any other information required by the regulations in this part or part 319 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(d) The principal display panel shall be the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for sale. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part and part 319 of this subchapter with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring of such information by designs or vignettes or crowding. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. The principal display panel shall be:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a rectangular package, one entire side, the area of which is at least the product of the height times the width of that side.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container:</P>
              <P>(i) An area that is 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference of the container, or</P>

              <P>(ii) A panel, the width of which is one-third of the circumference and the height of which is as high as the container: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if there is immediately to the right or left of such principal display panel, a panel which has a width not greater than 20 percent of the circumference and a height as high as the container, and which is reserved for information prescribed in paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (5), such panel shall be known as the “20 percent panel” and such information may be shown on that panel in lieu of showing it on the principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of a container of any other shape, 40 percent of the total surface of the container.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Any descriptive designation used as a product name for a product which has no common or usual name shall clearly and completely identify the product. Product which has been prepared by salting, smoking, drying, cooking, chopping, or otherwise shall be so described on the label unless the name of the product implies, or the manner of packaging shows that the product was subjected to such preparation. The unqualified terms “meat,” “meat byproduct,” “meat food product,” and terms common to the meat industry but not common to consumers such as “picnic,” “butt,” “cala,” “square,” “loaf,” “spread,” “delight,” “roll,” “plate,” “luncheon,” and “daisy” shall not be used as names of a product unless accompanied with terms descriptive of the product or with a list of ingredients, as deemed necessary in any specific case by the Administrator in order to assure that the label will not be false or misleading.</P>
              <P>(2) The product name for a raw meat product that contains added solution and does not meet a standard of identity in 9 CFR part 319 must contain a descriptive designation that includes:</P>

              <P>(i) The percentage of added solution (total weight of the solution ingredients divided by the weight of the raw meat without solution or any other added ingredients multiplied by 100). The percentage of added solution must appear as a number (such as, 15, 20, 30) and the percent symbol (%). The percentage of added solution may be declared by the words “containing” or “contains” (such as, “contains 15% added solution of water and salt,” or “containing 15% added solution of water and teriyaki sauce”).<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The common or usual name of all individual ingredients or multi-ingredient components in the solution listed in descending order of predominance by weight.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the descriptive designation includes all ingredients in the solution, a separate ingredients statement is not required on the label. When the descriptive designation includes multi-ingredient components and the ingredients of the component are not declared in the descriptive designation, all ingredients in the product must be declared in a separate ingredients statement on the label as required in § 317.2(c)(2) and (f).</P>
              <P>(iv) The product name and the descriptive designation must be printed in a single easy-to-read type style and color and must appear on a single-color contrasting background. The print may appear in upper and lower case letters, with the lower case letters not smaller than one-third (<FR>1/3</FR>) the size of the largest letter.</P>
              <P>(v) The word “enhanced” cannot be used in the product name.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Product name and required validated cooking instructions for needle- or blade-tenderized beef products.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Unless the product is destined to be fully cooked or to receive another full lethality treatment at an official establishment, the product name for a raw or partially cooked beef product that has been mechanically tenderized, whether by needle or by blade, must contain the term “mechanically tenderized,” “needle tenderized,” or “blade tenderized,” as a descriptive designation and an accurate description of the beef component.</P>
              <P>(ii) The product name must appear in a single easy-to-read type style and color and on a single-color contrasting background. The print may appear in upper and lower case letters, with the lower case letters not smaller than <FR>1/3</FR> the size of the largest letter.</P>
              <P>(iii) The labels on raw or partially cooked needle- or blade-tenderized beef products destined for household consumers, hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions must contain validated cooking instructions, including the cooking method, that inform consumers that these products need to be cooked to a specified minimum internal temperature, whether the product needs to be held for a specified time at that temperature or higher before consumption to ensure that potential pathogens are destroyed throughout the product, and a statement that the internal temperature should be measured by a thermometer. These validated cooking instructions may appear anywhere on the label.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) The list of ingredients shall show the common or usual names of the ingredients arranged in the descending order of predominance, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(i) The terms spice, natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor and flavoring may be used in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(A) The term “spice” means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, with the exceptions of onions, garlic and celery, whose primary function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in 21 CFR 182.10, and 184.</P>

              <P>(7) The ratio of height to width of letters and numerals shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide). Heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the height standards.</P>
              <P>(8) The statement shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel and shall be separated by a space at least equal to the height of the lettering used in the statement from other printed label information appearing above or below the statement and by a space at least equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the statement.

              <P>(a) The Administrator may approve and authorize the use of abbreviations of marks of inspection under the regulations in this subchapter. Such abbreviations shall have the same force and effect as the respective marks for which they are authorized abbreviations.</P>
              <P>(b) Except for the purposes of preparing and submitting a sample or samples of the same to the Administrator for approval, no brand manufacturer, printer, or other person shall cast, print, lithograph, or otherwise make any marking device containing any official mark or simulation thereof, or any label bearing any such mark or simulation, without the written authority therefor of the Administrator. However, when any such sample label, or other marking device, is approved by the Administrator, additional supplies of the approved label, or marking device, may be made for use in accordance with the regulations in this subchapter, without further approval by the Administrator. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to labels, or other marking devices, bearing or containing an official inspection legend shown in § 312.2(b), § 312.3(a) (only the legend appropriate for horse meat food products) or § 312.3(b) (only the legend appropriate for other (nonhorse) equine meat food products), or any abbreviations, copy or representation thereof.</P>

              <P>(c) No brand manufacturer or other person shall cast or otherwise make, without an official certificate issued in quadruplicate by a Program employee, a brand or other marking device containing an official inspection legend, or simulation thereof, shown in § 312.2(a), § 312.3(a) (only the legend appropriate <PRTPAGE P="177"/>for horse carcasses and parts of horse carcasses), § 312.3(b) (only the legend appropriate for other equine (nonhorse) carcasses and parts of other (nonhorse) equine carcasses) or § 312.7(a).</P>

The certificate authorizes the making of only the brands or other marking devices of the type and quantity listed on the certificate.</P>
              <P>(2) After signing the certificate, the Program employee and the establishment shall each keep a copy, and the remaining two copies shall be given to the brand or other marking device manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer of the brands or other marking devices shall engrave or otherwise mark each brand or other marking device with a permanent identifying serial number unique to it. The manufacturer shall list on each of the two copies of the certificate given to the manufacturer the number of each brand or other marking device authorized by the certificate. The manufacturer shall retain one copy of the certificate for the manufacturer's records and return the remaining copy with the brands or other marking devices to the Program employee whose name and address are given on the certificate as the recipient.</P>
              <P>(4) In order that all such brands or other marking devices bear identifying numbers, within one year after June 24, 1985, an establishment shall either replace each such brand or other marking device which does not bear an identifying number, or, under the direction of the inspector-in-charge, mark such brand or other marking device with a permanent identifying number.</P>

              <SUBJECT>False or misleading labeling or practices generally; specific prohibitions and requirements for labels and containers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) No product or any of its wrappers, packaging, or other containers shall bear any false or misleading marking, label, or other labeling and no statement, word, picture, design, or device which conveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin or quality or is otherwise false or misleading shall appear in any marking or other labeling. No product shall be wholly or partly enclosed in any wrapper, packaging, or other container that is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading.</P>
              <P>(b) The labels and containers of product shall comply with the following provisions, as applicable:</P>

              <P>(1) Terms having geographical significance with reference to a locality other than that in which the product is prepared may appear on the label only when qualified by the word “style,” “type,” or “brand,” as the case may be, in the same size and style of lettering as in the geographical term, and accompanied with a prominent qualifying statement identifying the country, State, Territory, or locality in which the product is prepared, using terms appropriate to effect the qualification. When the word “style” or “type” is used, there must be a recognized style or type of product identified with and peculiar to the area represented by the geographical term and the product must possess the characteristics of such style or type, and the word “brand” shall not be used in such a way as to be false or misleading: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That a geographical term which has come into general usage as a trade name and which has been approved by the Administrator as being a generic term may be used without the qualifications provided for in this paragraph. The terms “frankfurter,” “vienna,” “bologna,” “lebanon bologna,” “braunschweiger,” “thuringer,” “genoa,” “leona,” “berliner,” “holstein,” “goteborg,” “milan,” “polish,” “italian,” and their modifications, as applied to sausages, the terms “brunswick” and “irish” as applied to stews and the term “boston” as applied to pork shoulder butts need not be accompanied with the word “style,” “type,” or “brand,” or a statement identifying the locality in which the product is prepared.</P>

              <P>(2) Such terms as “farm” or “country” shall not be used on labels in connection with products unless such products are actually prepared on the farm or in the country: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That if the product is prepared in the same way as on the farm or in the country these terms, if qualified by the word “style” in the same size and style of lettering, may be used: <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That the term “farm” may be used as part of a brand designation when qualified by the word “brand” in the same size and style of lettering, and followed with a statement identifying the locality in which the product is prepared: <E T="03">And Provided further,</E> That the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to products prepared in accordance with § 319.106 of this subchapter. Sausage containing cereal shall not be labeled “farm style” or “country style,” and lard not rendered in an open kettle shall not be designated as “farm style” or “country style.”</P>
              <P>(3) The requirement that the label shall contain the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall not relieve any establishment from the requirement that its label shall not be misleading in any particular.</P>
              <P>(4) The term “spring lamb” or “genuine spring lamb” is applicable only to carcasses of new-crop lambs slaughtered during the period beginning in March and terminating not beyond the close of the week containing the first Monday in October.</P>

              <P>(5)(i) Coverings shall not be of such color, design, or kind as to be misleading with respect to color, quality, or kind of product to which they are applied. For example, transparent or semitransparent coverings for such articles as sliced bacon or fresh (uncooked) meat and meat food products shall not bear lines or other designs of red or other color which give a false impression of leanness of the product. Transparent or semitransparent wrappers, casings, or coverings for use in packaging cured, cured and smoked, or cured and cooked <PRTPAGE P="179"/>sausage products, and sliced ready-to-eat meat food products may be color tinted or bear red designs on 50 percent of such wrapper or covering: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the transparent or semitransparent portion of the principal display panel is free of color tinting and red designs: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That the principal display panel provides at least 20 percent unobstructed clear space, consolidated in one area so that the true nature and color of the product is visible to the consumer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Packages for sliced bacon that have a transparent opening shall be designed to expose, for viewing, the cut surface of a representative slice. Packages for sliced bacon which meet the following specifications will be accepted as meeting the requirements of this subparagraph provided the enclosed bacon is positioned so that the cut surface of the representative slice can be visually examined:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) For shingle-packed sliced bacon, the transparent window shall be designed to reveal at least 70 percent of the length (longest dimension) of the representative slice, and this window shall be at least 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches wide. The transparent window shall be located not more than five-eighths inch from the top or bottom edge of a 1-pound or smaller package and not more than three-fourths inch from either the top or bottom edge of a package larger than 1 pound.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) For stack-packed sliced bacon, the transparent window shall be designed to reveal at least 70 percent of the length (longest dimension) of the representative slice and be at least 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches wide.</P>
              <P>(6) The word “fresh” shall not be used on labels to designate product which contains any sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, or potassium nitrite, or which has been salted for preservation.</P>
              <P>(7)(i) No ingredient shall be designated on the label as a spice, flavoring, or coloring unless it is a spice, flavoring, or coloring, as the case may be. An ingredient that is both a spice and a coloring, or both a flavoring and a coloring, shall be designated as “spice and coloring”, or “flavoring and coloring”, as the case may be, unless such ingredient is designated by its common or usual name.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any ingredient not designated in § 317.2(f)(1)(i) of this part whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of livestock and poultry origin must be designated by names that include the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients are derived.</P>
              <P>(8) As used on labels of product, the term “gelatin” shall mean (i) the jelly prepared in official establishments by cooking pork skins, tendons, or connective tissue from inspected and passed product, and (ii) dry commercial gelatin or the jelly resulting from its use.</P>
              <P>(9) Product (other than canned product) labeled with the term “loaf” as part of its name:</P>
              <P>(i) If distributed from the official establishment in consumer size containers may be in any shape;</P>
              <P>(ii) If distributed in a container of a size larger than that sold intact at retail the product shall be prepared in rectangular form, or as in paragraph (b)(9)(iii) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) If labeled as an “Old Fashioned Loaf” shall be prepared in a traditional form, such as rectangular with rounded top or circular with flat bottom and rounded top.</P>
              <P>(10) The term “baked” shall apply only to product which has been cooked by the direct action of dry heat and for a sufficient time to permit the product to assume the characteristics of a baked article, such as the formation of a brown crust on the surface, rendering out of surface fat, and the caramelization of the sugar if applied. Baked loaves shall be heated to a temperature of at least 160 °F. and baked pork cuts shall be heated to an internal temperature of at least 170 °F.</P>
              <P>(11) When products such as loaves are browned by dipping in hot edible oil or by a flame, the label shall state such fact, e.g., by the words “Browned in Hot Cottonseed Oil” or “Browned by a Flame,” as the case may be, appearing as part of the product name.</P>

              <P>(12) The term “meat” and the names of particular kinds of meat, such as beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork, <PRTPAGE P="180"/>shall not be used in such manner as to be false or misleading.</P>
              <P>(13) The word “ham,” without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine. Ham shanks as such or ham shank meat as such or the trimmings accruing in the trimming and shaping of hams shall not be labeled “ham” or “ham meat” without qualification. When used in connection with a chopped product the term “ham” or “ham meat” shall not include the skin.</P>
              <P>(14) The terms “shankless” and “hockless” shall apply only to hams and pork shoulders from which the shank or hock has been completely removed, thus eliminating the entire tibia and fibula, or radius and ulna, respectively, together with the overlying muscle, skin, and other tissue.</P>
              <P>(15) Such terms as “meat extract” or “extract of beef” without qualification shall not be used on labels in connection with products prepared from organs or other parts of the carcass, other than fresh meat. Extracts prepared from any parts of the carcass other than fresh meat may be properly labeled as extracts with the true name of the parts from which prepared. In the case of extract in fluid form, the word “fluid” shall also appear on the label, as, for example, “fluid extract of beef.”</P>
              <P>(16) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(17) When any product is enclosed in a container along with a packing substance such as brine, vinegar, or agar jelly, a declaration of the packing substance shall be printed prominently on the label as part of the name of the product, as for example, “frankfurts packed in brine,” “lamb tongue packed in vinegar,” or “beef tongue packed in agar jelly,” as the case may be. The packing substance shall not be used in such a manner as will result in the container being so filled as to be misleading.</P>
              <P>(18) “Leaf lard” is lard prepared from fresh leaf fat.</P>
              <P>(19) When lard or hardened lard is mixed with rendered pork fat or hardened rendered pork fat, the mixture shall be designated as “rendered pork fat” or “hardened rendered pork fat,” as the case may be.</P>
              <P>(20) Oil, stearin, or stock obtained from beef or mutton fats rendered at a temperature above 170 °F. shall not be designated as “oleo oil,” “oleo stearin,” or “oleo stock,” respectively.</P>
              <P>(21) When not more than 20 percent of beef fat, mutton fat, oleo stearin, vegetable stearin, or hardened vegetable fat is mixed with lard or with rendered pork fat, there shall appear on the label, contiguous to and in the same size and style of lettering as the name of the product, the words “beef fat added,” “mutton fat added,” “oleo stearin added,” “vegetable stearin added,” or “hardened vegetable fat added,” as the case may be. If more than 20 percent is added, the product name shall refer to the particular animal fat or fats used, such as, “Lard and Beef Fat.” The designation “vegetable fat” is applicable to vegetable oil, vegetable stearin, or a combination of such oil and stearin, whereas the designations “vegetable oil” and “vegetable stearin” shall be applicable only to the oil and the stearin respectively, when used in meat food products.</P>
              <P>(22) Cooked, cured, or pickled pigs feet, pigs knuckles, and similar products, shall be labeled to show that the bones remain in the product, if such is the case. The designation “semi-boneless” shall not be used if less than 50 percent of the total weight of bones has been removed.</P>
              <P>(23) When monoglycerides, diglycerides, and/or polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are added to rendered animal fat or a combination of such fat and vegetable fat, there shall appear on the label in a prominent manner and contiguous to the name of the product a statement such as “With Monoglycerides and Diglycerides Added,” or “With Diglycerides and Monoglycerides,” or “With Polyglycerol Esters of Fatty Acids” as the case may be.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interpretation and statement of labeling policy for cured products; special labeling requirements concerning nitrate and nitrite.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) With respect to sections 1(n) (7), (9), and (12) of the Act and § 317.2, any substance mixed with another substance to cure a product must be identified in the ingredients statement on the label of such product. For example, curing mixtures composed of such ingredients as water, salt, sugar, sodium phosphate, sodium nitrate, and sodium nitrite or other permitted substances which are added to any product, must be identified on the label of the product by listing each such ingredient in accordance with the provisions of § 317.2.</P>
              <P>(b) Any product, such as bacon and pepperoni, which is required to be labeled by a common or usual name or descriptive name in accordance with § 317.2(c)(1) and to which nitrate or nitrite is permitted or required to be added may be prepared without nitrate or nitrite and labeled with such common or usual name or descriptive name when immediately preceded with the term “Uncured” as part of the product name in the same size and style of lettering as the product name, provided that the product is found by the Administrator to be similar in size, flavor, consistency, and general appearance to such product as commonly prepared with nitrate or nitrite, or both.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Products described in paragraph (b) of this section or § 319.2 of this subchapter, which contain no nitrate or nitrite shall bear the statement “No Nitrate or Nitrite Added.” This statement shall be adjacent to the product name in lettering of easily readable style and at least one-half the size of the product name.</P>

              <P>(2) Products described in paragraph (b) of this section and § 319.2 of this subchapter shall bear, adjacent to the product name in lettering of easily readable style and at least one-half the size of the product name, the statement “Not Preserved—Keep Refrigerated Below 40 °F. At All Times” unless they have been thermally processed to F<E T="52">o</E> 3 or more; they have been fermented or pickled to pH of 4.6 or less; or they have been dried to a water activity of 0.92 or less.</P>
              <P>(3) Products described in paragraph (b) of this section and § 319.2 of this subchapter shall not be subject to the labeling requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if they contain an amount of salt sufficient to achieve a brine concentration of 10 percent or more.</P>

              <P>(a) Edible products may not be packaged in a container which is composed in whole or in part of any poisonous or deleterious substances which may render the contents adulterated or injurious to health. All packaging materials must be safe for their intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FFDCA).</P>

              <P>(b) Packaging materials entering the official establishment must be accompanied or covered by a guaranty, or statement of assurance, from the packaging supplier under whose brand name and firm name the material is marketed to the official establishment. The guaranty shall state that the material's intended use complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations. The guaranty must identify the material, e.g., by the distinguishing brand name or code designation appearing on the packaging material shipping container; must specify the applicable conditions of use, including temperature limits and any other pertinent limits specified under the FFDCA and food additive regulations; and must be signed by an authorized official of the supplying firm. The guaranty may be limited to a specific shipment of an article, in which case it may be part of or attached to the invoice covering such shipment, or it may be general and continuing, in which case, in its application to any article or other shipment of an article, it shall be considered to have been given at the date such article was shipped by the person who gives the guaranty. Guaranties consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's regulations regarding such guaranties <PRTPAGE P="185"/>(21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13) will be acceptable. The management of the establishment must maintain a file containing guaranties for all food contact packaging materials in the establishment. The file shall be made available to Program inspectors or other Department officials upon request. While in the official establishment, the identity of all packaging materials must be traceable to the applicable guaranty.</P>
              <P>(c) The guaranty by the packaging supplier will be accepted by Program inspectors to establish that the use of material complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) The Department will monitor the use of packaging material in official establishments to assure that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and may question the basis for any guaranty described under paragraph (b) of this section. Official establishments and packaging suppliers providing written guaranties to those official establishments will be permitted an opportunity to provide information tm designated Department officials as needed to verify the basis for any such guaranty. The required information will include, but is not limited to, manufacturing firm's name, trade name or code designation for the material, complete chemical composition, and use. Selection of a material for review does not in itself affect a material's acceptability. Materials may continue to be used during the review period. However, if information requested from the supplier is not provided within the time indicated in the request—a minimum of 30 days—any applicable guaranty shall cease to be effective, and approval to continue using the specified packaging material in official establishments may be denied. The Administrator may extend this time where reasonable grounds for extension are shown, as, for example, where data must be obtained from suppliers.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator may disapprove for use in official establishments packaging materials whose use cannot be confirmed as complying with FFDCA and applicable food additive regulations. Before approval to use a packaging material is finally denied by the Administrator, the affected official establishment and the supplier of the material shall be given notice and the opportunity to present their views to the Administrator. If the official establishment and the supplier do not accept the Administrator's determination, a hearing in accordance with applicable rules of practice will be held to resolve such dispute. Approval to use the materials pending the outcome of the presentation of views or hearing shall be denied if the Administrator determines that such use may present an imminent hazard to public health.</P>
              <P>(f) Periodically, the Administrator will issue to inspectors a listing, by distinguishing brand name or code designation, of packaging materials that have been reviewed and that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Listed materials will not be permitted for use in official establishments. If a subsequent review of any material indicates that it meets the requirements of paragraph (a), the material will be deleted from the listing.</P>
              <P>(g) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of Program inspectors to refuse a specific material if he/she determines the material may render products adulterated or injurious to health.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nutrition label content.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The term “serving” or “serving size” means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older, which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the product. When the product is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.</P>

              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8), (b)(12), and (b)(14) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts <PRTPAGE P="187"/>Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion—General Food Supply” (Reference Amount(s)) that appear in § 317.312(b) using the procedures described in this paragraph (b). For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ___ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the Reference Amounts in § 317.312(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrition claims.</P>
              <P>(3) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of the product “as packaged” for all products, except that single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 may be declared on the basis of the product “as consumed”. For single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, if data are based on the product ‘as consumed,’ the data must be presented in accordance with § 317.345(d). In addition to the required declaration on the basis of “as packaged” for products other than single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, the declaration may also be made on the basis of “as consumed,” provided that preparation and cooking instructions are clearly stated.</P>
              <P>(4) For products in discrete units (e.g., hot dogs, and individually packaged products within a multi-serving package), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., beef fritters and barbecue sauce), the serving size shall be declared as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent but less than 67 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be one unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a unit weighs 200 percent or more of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit as the serving size if the whole unit can reasonably be consumed at a single eating occasion.</P>
              <P>(v) For products that have Reference Amounts of 100 grams (or milliliter) or larger and are individual units within a multi-serving package, if a unit contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may decide whether to declare the individual unit as 1 or 2 servings.</P>
              <P>(vi) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., beef fritters and barbecue sauce), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product as determined in § 317.312(c).</P>
              <P>(vii) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.</P>

              <P>(5) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g. pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be <PRTPAGE P="188"/>consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g., <FR>1/8</FR> quiche, <FR>1/4</FR> pizza) that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category. The serving size may be the fraction of the package used to make the Reference Amount for the unprepared product determined in § 317.312(d) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount of the combined product determined in § 317.312(c). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use <FR>1/2</FR>, <FR>1/3</FR>, <FR>1/4</FR>, <FR>1/5</FR>, <FR>1/6</FR>, or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.</P>
              <P>(6) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., whole roast beef, marinated beef tenderloin, large can of chili), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., roast beef and gravy), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product determined in § 317.312(c).</P>
              <P>(7) For labeling purposes, the term “common household measure” or “common household unit” means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g., <FR>1/4</FR> pizza), ounce (oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar or tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section, the following rules shall be used:</P>
              <P>(i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate. Cups shall be expressed in <FR>1/4</FR>- or <FR>1/3</FR>-cup increments, tablespoons in whole number of tablespoons for quantities less than <FR>1/4</FR> cup but greater than or equal to 2 tablespoons (tbsp), 1, 1<FR>1/3</FR>, 1<FR>1/2</FR>, or 1 <FR>2/3</FR> tbsp for quantities less than 2 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 tbsp, and teaspoons in whole number of teaspoons for quantities less than 1 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 teaspoon (tsp), and in <FR>1/4</FR>-tsp increments for quantities less than 1 tsp.</P>
              <P>(ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.</P>
              <P>(iii) If cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, or units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, or fraction are not applicable, ounces may be used. Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5-ounce increments most closely approximating the Reference Amount with rounding indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2.5 ounces).</P>
              <P>(iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single-serving containers and for individually packaged products within multi-serving containers (e.g., can, box, package, meal, or dinner). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., chop, slice, link, or patty).</P>
              <P>(v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.</P>
              <P>(vi) For products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., ham with a glaze packet), the nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 grams (g).</P>

              <P>(viii) When a serving size, determined from the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes (e.g., 2.5 tbsp), manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.<PRTPAGE P="189"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) A product that is packaged and sold individually and that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable Reference Amount shall be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product shall be labeled as one serving, except for products that have Reference Amounts of 100 g (or mL) or larger, manufacturers may decide whether a package that contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount is 1 or 2 servings. Packages sold individually that contain 200 percent or more of the applicable Reference Amount may be labeled as a single-serving if the entire content of the package can reasonably be consumed at a single-eating occasion.</P>
              <P>(9) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(8) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams), except for single-serving containers.</P>
              <P>(i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to paragraph (b)(11) of this section. However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single-servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.</P>
              <P>(ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.</P>
              <P>(iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced bologna. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1-oz increments.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, and oz for ounce.</P>
              <P>(10) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2 servings; about 3.5 servings).</P>
              <P>(ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size (e.g., pickled pigs feet), the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).</P>
              <P>(iii) For random weight products, a manufacturer may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the Reference Amount expressed in ounces. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parenthesis following the “varied” statement (e.g., varied (approximately 8 servings per pound)).</P>
              <P>(iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.</P>

              <P>(v) For packages containing several individually packaged multi-serving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number of individual multi-serving units in the <PRTPAGE P="190"/>total package by the number of servings in each individual unit. The declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, including those that have been previously frozen.</P>
              <P>(11) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of product as packaged or purchased with the exception of single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 and products that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of products that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.</P>
              <P>(12) The serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(l) and § 317.313(m) in single-serving containers will be the entire edible content of the package. Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers will be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 317.312(b) if the product is listed in § 317.312(b). Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers that are not listed in § 317.312(b) will be based on the reference amount according to § 317.312(c), (d), and (e).</P>
              <P>(13) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information in the same format as required by § 317.309(e),</P>
              <P>(i) Per 100 grams, 100 milliliters, or 1 ounce of the product as packaged or purchased.</P>
              <P>(ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units in a multi-serving container is more than one unit.</P>
              <P>(14) If a product consists of assortments of meat or meat food products (e.g., variety packs) in the same package, nutrient content shall be expressed on the entire package contents or on each individual product.</P>

              <P>(15) If a product is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient contents on the basis of the product as consumed for the product alone (e.g., a cream soup mix may be labeled with one set of Daily Values for the dry mix (per serving), and another set for the serving of the final soup when prepared (e.g., per serving of cream soup mix and 1 cup of vitamin D fortified whole milk)): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.</P>
              <P>(c) The declaration of nutrition information on the label or in labeling of a meat or meat food product shall contain information about the level of the following nutrients, except for those nutrients whose inclusion, and the declaration of amounts, is voluntary as set forth in this paragraph. No nutrients or food components other than those listed in this paragraph as either mandatory or voluntary may be included within the nutrition label. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, nutrient information shall be presented using the nutrient names specified and in the following order in the formats specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) “Calories, total,” “Total calories,” or “Calories”: A statement of the caloric content per serving, expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, and 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero. Energy content per serving may also be expressed in kilojoule units, added in parenthesis immediately following the statement of the caloric content.</P>

              <P>(i) Caloric content may be calculated by the following methods. Where either specific or general food factors are used, the factors shall be applied to the actual amount (i.e., before rounding) of food components (e.g., fat, carbohydrate, protein, or ingredients with specific food factors) present per serving.<PRTPAGE P="191"/>

When the protein in products represented or purported to be for adults and children 4 or more years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 20 expressed as a percent, or when the protein in a product represented or purported to be for children greater than 1 but less than 4 years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 40 expressed as a percent, either of the following shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content by weight: The statement “not a significant source of protein,” or a listing aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value” of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or Reference Daily Intake (RDI), as appropriate, for protein and expressed as percent of Daily Value. When the protein quality in a product as measured by the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is less than 40 percent of the reference standard (casein) for a product represented or purported to be for infants, the statement “not a significant source of protein” shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content. Protein content may be calculated on the basis of the factor of 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by appropriate methods of analysis in accordance with § 317.309(h), except when the procedure for a specific food requires another factor.</P>
              <P>(i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product is represented or purported to be for infants or children under 4 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it shall be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the product is represented or purported to be for infants and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.</P>

              <P>(ii) The corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving for products represented or purported to be for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 in “Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” Rome, 1990, which is incorporated by reference. Sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 of the “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” as published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization, is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval.

For products represented or purported to be for infants, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject product's protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.</P>
              <P>(iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and the RDI for protein for children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women shall be 16 grams, 14 grams, 60 grams, and 65 grams, respectively.</P>

For products represented or purported to be for use by both infants and children under 4 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants from birth to 12 months of age and for children under 4 years of age. Similarly, the percent of Daily Value based on both the RDI values for pregnant women and for lactating women shall be declared separately on products represented or purported to be for use by both pregnant and lactating women. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. All other products shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.</P>
              <P>(ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a percent of the RDI shall include vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron, in that order, and shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added, or when a claim is made about them. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or in labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:</P>
              <P>(A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another product; or</P>
              <P>(B) Included in a product solely for technological purposes and declared only in the ingredients statement.

              <P>(ii) Aggregate displays shall comply with format requirements of paragraph <PRTPAGE P="200"/>(d) of this section to the maximum extent possible, except that the identity of each food shall be specified to the right of the “Nutrition Facts” title, and both the quantitative amount by weight (i.e., g/mg amounts) and the percent Daily Value for each nutrient shall be listed in separate columns under the name of each food.</P>
              <P>(14) When nutrition labeling appears in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in a separate nutrition label for each language or in one nutrition label with the information in the second language following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated (e.g., “Protein/Proteinas 2 g”). All required information must be included in both languages.</P>
              <P>(e) Nutrition information may be presented for two or more forms of the same product (e.g., both “raw” and “cooked”) or for common combinations of foods as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for different units (e.g., per 100 grams) as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for two or more groups for which RDI's are established (e.g., both infants and children less than 4 years of age) as provided for in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. When such dual labeling is provided, equal prominence shall be given to both sets of values. Information shall be presented in a format consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) Following the subheading of “Amount Per Serving,” there shall be two or more column headings accurately describing the forms of the same product (e.g., “raw” and “roasted”), the combinations of foods, the units, or the RDI groups that are being declared. The column representing the product as packaged and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b) shall be to the left of the numeric columns.</P>
              <P>(2) When the dual labeling is presented for two or more forms of the same product, for combinations of foods, or for different units, total calories and calories from fat (and calories from saturated fat, when declared) shall be listed in a column and indented as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section with quantitative amounts declared in columns aligned under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Quantitative information by weight required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section shall be specified for the form of the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b).</P>
              <P>(i) Quantitative information by weight may be included for other forms of the product represented by the additional column(s) either immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information by weight for the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 317.312(b) or as a footnote.</P>
              <P>(A) If such additional quantitative information is given immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information, it shall be declared for all nutrients listed and placed immediately following and differentiated from the required quantitative information (e.g., separated by a comma). Such information shall not be put in a separate column.</P>

              <P>(B) If such additional quantitative information is given in a footnote, it shall be declared in the same order as the nutrients are listed in the nutrition label. The additional quantitative information may state the total nutrient content of the product identified in the second column or the nutrient amounts added to the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301, for only those nutrients that are present in different amounts than the amounts declared in the required quantitative information. The footnote shall clearly identify which amounts are declared. Any subcomponents declared shall be listed parenthetically after principal components (e.g., <FR>1/2</FR> cup <PRTPAGE P="201"/>skim milk contributes an additional 40 calories, 65 mg sodium, 6 g total carbohydrate (6 g sugars), and 4 g protein).</P>
              <P>(ii) Total fat and its quantitative amount by weight shall be followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) (e.g., “Total fat (2 g)*”) referring to another asterisk (or symbol) at the bottom of the nutrition label identifying the form(s) of the product for which quantitative information is presented.</P>
              <P>(4) Information required in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii) and (d)(8) of this section shall be presented under the subheading “% DAILY VALUE” and in columns directly under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:</P>

              </GPH>

              <P>(f)(1) Nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as set forth herein when any required nutrients, other than the core nutrients <PRTPAGE P="203"/>(i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, and protein), are present in insignificant amounts. An insignificant amount shall be defined as that amount that may be rounded to zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars and protein, it shall be an amount less than 1 gram.</P>
              <P>(2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:</P>
              <P>(i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, sodium, and protein;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any of the following that are present in more than insignificant amounts: Calories from fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, sugars, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added in fortified or fabricated foods.</P>
              <P>(3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the product in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.</P>
              <P>(4) Any required nutrient, other than a core nutrient, that is present in an insignificant amount may be omitted from the tabular listing, provided that the following statement is included at the bottom of the nutrition label, “Not a significant source of ____.” The blank shall be filled in with the appropriate nutrient or food component. Alternatively, amounts of vitamins and minerals present in insignificant amounts may be declared by the use of an asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).”</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section and in § 317.400(c) and (d), nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required. When the footnote is omitted, an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”</P>
              <P>(g) Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section and § 317.302(a) by one or more of the following means:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or linear (i.e., string) fashion, rather than in vertical columns if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion only if the package shape or size will not accommodate a tabular display.</P>
              <P>(ii) When nutrition information is given in a linear display, the nutrition information shall be set off in a box by the use of a hairline. The percent Daily Value is separated from the quantitative amount declaration by the use of parenthesis, and all nutrients, both principal components and subcomponents, are treated similarly. Bolding is required only on the title “Nutrition Facts” and is allowed for nutrient names for “Calories,” “Total fat,” “Cholesterol,” “Sodium,” “Total carbohydrate,” and “Protein.”</P>

              <P>(1) A production lot is a set of food production consumer units that are from one production shift. Alternatively, a collection of consumer units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, constitutes a production lot.</P>

              <P>(2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each from a production lot. Alternatively, the sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each randomly chosen to be representative of a production lot. In each case, the units may be individually analyzed and the results of the analyses averaged, or the units would be composited and the composite analyzed. In both cases, the results, whether an average or a single result from a composite, will be considered by the Agency to be the nutrient content of a composite. All analyses shall be performed by appropriate methods and procedures used by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the “Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,” or, if no USDA method is available and appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in accordance with the 1990 edition of the “Official Methods of Analysis” of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15th ed., which is incorporated by reference, unless a particular method of analysis is specified in § 317.309(c), or, if no USDA, AOAC, or specified method is available and appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures as so determined by the Agency. The “Official Methods of Analysis” is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              <SUBJECT>Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The general principles followed in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (Reference Amount(s)), as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are:</P>
              <P>(1) The Reference Amounts are calculated for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.</P>
              <P>(2) The Reference Amounts are calculated for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such Reference Amounts are to be used only when the product is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.</P>
              <P>(3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.</P>
              <P>(4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion were considered.</P>
              <P>(5) When survey data were insufficient, FSIS took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:</P>
              <P>(i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;</P>
              <P>(iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the Reference Amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.</P>
              <P>(7) The Reference Amount is based on the major intended use of the product (e.g., a mixed dish measurable with a cup as a main dish and not as a side dish).</P>
              <P>(8) The Reference Amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other products, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., ground beef), are based on use in the form purchased.</P>
              <P>(9) FSIS sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform Reference Amount.</P>
              <P>(b) The following Product Categories and Reference Amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:</P>

              <P>(1) For bulk products, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be the Reference Amount, as established in paragraph (b) of this section, for the ingredient that is represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.</P>
              <P>(2) For products where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is one or more discrete units, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be either the number of small discrete units or the fraction of the large discrete unit that is represented as the main ingredient that is closest to the Reference Amount for that ingredient as established in paragraph (b) of this section plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Reference Amounts are in compatible units, they shall be summed (e.g., ingredients in equal volumes such as tablespoons). If the Reference Amounts are in incompatible units, the weights of the appropriate volumes should be used (e.g., grams of one ingredient plus gram weight of tablespoons of a second ingredient).</P>
              <P>(d) If a product requires further preparation, e.g., cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a Reference Amount for the product in the prepared form, then the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be determined using the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare one large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the fraction of the large discrete unit closest to the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(e) The Reference Amount for an imitation or substitute product or altered product as defined in § 317.313(d), such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the <PRTPAGE P="208"/>same as for the product for which it is offered as a substitute.</P>
              <P>(f) The Reference Amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutritional claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the Reference Amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the Reference Amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the Reference Amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parentheses, by the amount in common household measure if the Reference Amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures.</P>
              <P>(g) The Administrator, on his or her own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a labeling application, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a Product Category or Reference Amount identified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Labeling applications and supporting documentation to be filed under this section shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer disc copy. If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application shall state the applicant's post office address.</P>
              <P>(2) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information submitted to and retained in the files of the Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.</P>
              <P>(3) The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.</P>
              <P>(4) Data accompanying the labeling application, such as food consumption data, shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified. If such data has already been submitted with an earlier labeling application from the applicant, the present labeling application must provide the data.</P>

                <P>The undersigned, ______ submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 317.312 with respect to Reference Amount and/or Product Category.</P>
                <P>Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:</P>
                <P>(i) A statement of the objective of the labeling application;</P>
                <P>(ii) A description of the product;</P>
                <P>(iii) A complete sample product label including nutrition label, using the format established by regulation;</P>
                <P>(iv) A description of the form in which the product will be marketed;</P>
                <P>(v) The intended dietary uses of the product with the major use identified (e.g., ham as a luncheon meat);</P>

                <P>(vi) If the intended use is primarily as an ingredient in other foods, list of foods or food categories in which the product will be used as an ingredient with information on the prioritization of the use;<PRTPAGE P="209"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vii) The population group for which the product will be offered for use (e.g., infants, children under 4 years of age);</P>
                <P>(viii) The names of the most closely-related products (or in the case of foods for special dietary use and imitation or substitute foods, the names of the products for which they are offered as substitutes);</P>
                <P>(ix) The suggested Reference Amount (the amount of edible portion of food as consumed, excluding bone, skin or other inedible components) for the population group for which the product is intended with full description of the methodology and procedures that were used to determine the suggested Reference Amount. In determining the Reference Amount, general principles and factors in paragraph (a) of this section should be followed.</P>
                <P>(x) The suggested Reference Amount shall be expressed in metric units. Reference Amounts for foods shall be expressed in grams except when common household units such as cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons are more appropriate or are more likely to promote uniformity in serving sizes declared on product labels. For example, common household measures would be more appropriate if products within the same category differ substantially in density such as mixed dishes measurable with a cup.</P>
                <P>(A) In expressing the Reference Amount in grams, the following general rules shall be followed:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For quantities greater than 10 grams, the quantity shall be expressed in nearest 5 grams increment.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For quantities less than 10 grams, exact gram weights shall be used.</P>
                <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(xi) A labeling application for a new subcategory of food with its own Reference Amount shall include the following additional information:</P>
                <P>(A) Data that demonstrate that the new subcategory of food will be consumed in amounts that differ enough from the Reference Amount for the parent category to warrant a separate Reference Amount. Data must include sample size, and the mean, standard deviation, median, and modal consumed amount per eating occasion for the product identified in the labeling application and for other products in the category. All data must be derived from the same survey data.</P>
                <P>(B) Documentation supporting the difference in dietary usage and product characteristics that affect the consumption size that distinguishes the product identified in the labeling application from the rest of the products in the category.</P>
                <P>(xii) In conducting research to collect or process food consumption data in support of the labeling application, the following general guidelines should be followed.</P>
                <P>(A) Sampled population selected should be representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the target population group for which the food is intended.</P>
                <P>(B) Sample size (i.e., number of eaters) should be large enough to give reliable estimates for customarily consumed amounts.</P>
                <P>(C) The study protocol should identify potential biases and describe how potential biases are controlled for or, if not possible to control, how they affect interpretation of results.</P>
                <P>(D) The methodology used to collect or process data including study design, sampling procedures, materials used (e.g., questionnaire, interviewer's manual), procedures used to collect or process data, methods or procedures used to control for unbiased estimates, and procedures used to correct for nonresponse, should be fully documented.</P>

                <P>(xiii) A statement concerning the feasibility of convening associations, corporations, consumers, and other interested parties to engage in negotiated rulemaking to develop a proposed rule.

              <SECTNO>§ 317.313</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Nutrient content claims; general principles.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to meat or meat food products that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale.</P>
              <P>(b) A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in nutrition labeling pursuant to § 317.309, may not be made on a label or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the product, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”</P>
              <P>(2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:</P>
              <P>(i) Describes the product or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Suggests that the product, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).</P>
              <P>(3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on products intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in applicable provisions in this subpart and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).</P>
              <P>(c) Information that is required or permitted by § 317.309 to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.</P>
              <P>(d) A “substitute” product is one that may be used interchangeably with another product that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”</P>
              <P>(1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the product, the product may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).</P>
              <P>(2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 317.2(h) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a product implies that the product differs from other products of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only products that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the product, remove the nutrient from the product, or not include the nutrient in the product, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium beef noodle soup”).</P>

              <P>(2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a product, or that a product is low in a nutrient when the product has not been specially processed, altered, <PRTPAGE P="212"/>formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the product inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all products of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “lard, a sodium free food”).</P>
              <P>(f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size and style no larger than two times that of the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.</P>
              <P>(g) Labeling information required in §§ 317.313, 317.354, 317.356, 317.360, 317.361, 317.362, and 317.380, whose type size is not otherwise specified, is required to be in letters and/or numbers no less than <FR>1/16</FR> inch in height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(h) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in § 317.309 or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart B of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 10 g of fat per serving;”</P>
              <P>(2) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the product is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 milligrams (mg) sodium per serving, not a low sodium product.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than required by § 317.2(h) for the net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2);</P>
              <P>(3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the product and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.</P>
              <P>(4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 317.362(b)(6).</P>
              <P>(j) A product may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the product with the level of a nutrient in a reference product. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.</P>
              <P>(1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the product must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference product as specified in this paragraph (j).</P>
              <P>(i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference product may be a dissimilar product within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet or a similar product.</P>
              <P>(B) For “light,” “reduced,” and “added” claims, the reference product shall be a similar product, and</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference product shall be representative of the type of product that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference product shall be representative of a broad base of products of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the product type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.</P>

              <P>(B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference product may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a <PRTPAGE P="213"/>substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name, provided the name of the competitor is not used on the labeling of the product. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting labeling is internally consistent (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information, and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the product has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) For products bearing relative claims:</P>
              <P>(i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference product by which the nutrient has been modified, (e.g., “50 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” or “<FR>1/3</FR> fewer calories than ‘reference product’ ”); and</P>
              <P>(ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required by § 317.2(h) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim, but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:</P>
              <P>(A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;</P>
              <P>(B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;</P>
              <P>(C) A claim on the information panel; or</P>
              <P>(D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.</P>
              <P>(iv) The label or labeling must also bear:</P>
              <P>(A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that in the reference product; and</P>
              <P>(B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.</P>
              <P>(3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient.</P>
              <P>(k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a product that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “modified fat ‘product’ ”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “contains 35 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.</P>
              <P>(l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal-type” product will be defined as a product that:</P>
              <P>(1) Makes a major contribution to the diet by:</P>
              <P>(i) Weighing at least 10 ounces per labeled serving; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Containing not less than three 40 gram portions of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;</P>
              <P>(B) Fruits and vegetables;</P>
              <P>(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;</P>
              <P>(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:</P>

              <P>(E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in <PRTPAGE P="214"/>the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and</P>
              <P>(2) Is represented as, or is in the form commonly understood to be, a breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal, or entre. Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.</P>
              <P>(m) For purposes of making a claim, a main-dish product will be defined as a food that:</P>
              <P>(1) Makes a major contribution to the meal by:</P>
              <P>(i) Weighing at least 6 ounces per labeled serving; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Containing not less than 40 grams of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;</P>
              <P>(B) Fruits and vegetables;</P>
              <P>(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;</P>
              <P>(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:</P>
              <P>(E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (m)(l)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and</P>

              <P>(3) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a main dish (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> not a beverage or dessert). Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.</P>
              <P>(n) Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 317.309, shall be provided for any food for which a nutrient content claim is made.</P>
              <P>(o) Compliance with requirements for nutrient content claims shall be in accordance with § 317.309(h).</P>
              <P>(p)(1) Unless otherwise specified, the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in § 317.312(b) through (e) shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount customarily consumed, and the amount of the nutrient contained in the labeled serving does not meet the maximum or minimum amount criterion in the definition for the descriptor for that nutrient, the claim shall be followed by the criteria for the claim as required by § 317.312(f) (e.g., “very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 55 grams”).</P>
              <P>(2) The criteria for the claim shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible print or type and in a size that is no less than that required by § 317.2(h) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the criteria statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 317.400(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(q) The following exemptions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Nutrient content claims that have not been defined by regulation and that appear as part of a brand name that was in use prior to November 27, 1991, may continue to be used as part of that brand name, provided they are not false or misleading under section 1(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1)).</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) A statement that describes the percentage of a vitamin or mineral in the food, including foods intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, in relation to a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as defined in § 317.309 may be made on the label or in the labeling of a food without a regulation authorizing such a claim for a specific vitamin or mineral.</P>
              <P>(4) The requirements of this section do not apply to infant formulas and medical foods, as described in 21 CFR 101.13(q)(4).</P>
              <P>(5) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(6) Nutrient content claims that were part of the name of a product that was subject to a standard of identity as of November 27, 1991, are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section whether or not they meet the definition of the descriptive term.</P>
              <P>(7) Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by FSIS. Labeling applications requesting approval of such a claim may be submitted pursuant to § 317.369.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat products identified in § 317.344, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under § 317.400. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with § 317.309. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Nutrition information on single-ingredient, raw meat products that are not ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat products identified in § 317.344, including those that have been previously frozen, may be provided at their point-of-purchase in accordance with the provisions of this section or on their label, in accordance with the provisions of § 317.309.</P>
              <P>(3) A retailer may provide nutrition information at the point-of-purchase by various methods, such as by posting a sign or by making the information readily available in brochures, notebooks, or leaflet form in close proximity to the food. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media. If a nutrition claim is made on point-of-purchase materials, all of the format and content requirements of § 317.309 apply. However, if only nutrition information—and not a nutrition claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase materials, the requirements of § 317.309 apply, provided, however:</P>
              <P>(i) The listing of percent of Daily Value for the nutrients (except vitamins and minerals specified in § 317.309(c)(8)) and footnote required by § 317.309(d)(9) may be omitted; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The point-of-purchase materials are not subject to any of the format requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) For the point-of-purchase materials, the declaration of nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as specified in § 317.309(f).</P>
              <P>(d) The nutrition label data for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be based on either the raw or cooked edible portions of meat cuts with external cover fat at trim levels reflecting current marketing practices. If data are based on cooked portions, the methods used to cook the products must be specified and for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be those which do not add nutrients from other ingredients such as flour, breading, and salt. Additional nutritional data may be presented on an optional basis for the raw or cooked edible portions of the separable lean of meat cuts.</P>

              <P>(e) Nutrient data that are the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, may be used for nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products, including those that have been previously frozen. These <PRTPAGE P="216"/>data may be composite data that reflect different quality grades of beef or other variables affecting nutrient content. Alternatively, data that reflect specific grades or other variables may be used, except that if data are used on labels attached to a product which is labeled as to grade of meat or other variables, the data must represent the product in the package when such data are contained in the representative data base. When data are used on labels attached to a product, the data must represent the edible meat tissues present in the package.</P>
              <P>(f) If the nutrition information is provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a nutrition label or labeling will not be subject to the Agency compliance review under § 317.309(h), unless a nutrition claim is made on the basis of the representative data base values.</P>
              <P>(g) Retailers may use data bases that they believe reflect the nutrient content of single-ingredient, raw meat products, including those that have been previously frozen; however, such labeling shall be subject to the compliance procedures of paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements specified in this subpart for the mandatory nutrition labeling program.</P>

              <P>(3) The term “light” or “lite” may be used in the brand name of a product to describe the sodium content, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The product is reduced by 50 percent or more in sodium content compared to the reference product;</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement specifically stating that the product is “light in sodium” or “lite in sodium” appears:</P>

              <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the terms “light” or “lite” may not be used to refer to a product that is not reduced in fat by 50 percent, or, if applicable, in calories by <FR>1/3</FR> or, when properly qualified, in sodium by 50 percent unless:</P>
              <P>(1) It describes some physical or organoleptic attribute of the product such as texture or color and the information (e.g., “light in color” or “light in texture”) so stated, clearly conveys the nature of the product; and</P>
              <P>(2) The attribute (e.g., “color” or “texture”) is in the same style, color, and at least one-half the type size as the word “light” and in immediate proximity thereto.</P>
              <P>(f) If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the word “light” has been associated, through common use, with a particular product to reflect a physical or organoleptic attribute to the point where it has become part of the statement of identity, such use of the term “light” shall not be considered a nutrient content claim subject to the requirements in this part.</P>
              <P>(g) The term “lightly salted” may be used on a product to which has been added 50 percent less sodium than is normally added to the reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1)(i)(B) and (j)(1)(ii)(B), provided that if the product is not “low in sodium” as defined in § 317.361(b)(4), the statement “not a low sodium food,” shall appear adjacent to the nutrition information and the information required to accompany a relative claim shall appear on the label or labeling as specified in § 317.313(j)(2).</P>

Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such terms unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The product contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 317.309(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving size;</P>
              <P>(ii) The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: “Adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie product,” “not a low calorie product,” or “not for weight control.”</P>
              <P>(2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:</P>
              <P>(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 317.309(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging;</P>
              <P>(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice;</P>
              <P>(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a product, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results;</P>
              <P>(iv) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and</P>
              <P>(v) The product bears a statement that the product is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the product meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” product) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.</P>
              <P>(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product, including products intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.</P>
              <P>(4) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar,” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:</P>

              <P>(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per reference amount customarily consumed than an <PRTPAGE P="222"/>appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and</P>
              <P>(ii) As required in § 317.313(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>
              <P>(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “this product contains 25 percent less sugar than our regular product”); and</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving”).</P>
              <P>(5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 317.313(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 317.313(j)(1); and</P>

                <P>Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:</P>

                <P>(i) A statement identifying the nutrient content claim and the nutrient that the term is intended to characterize with respect to the level of such nutrient. The statement <PRTPAGE P="232"/>shall address why the use of the term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement shall provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of products on which the claim will be used. The statement shall also specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the product must be met for the appropriate use of the term in labels or labeling, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.</P>
                <P>(ii) A detailed explanation supported by any necessary data of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and scientific data sufficient for such purpose, and data and information to the extent necessary to demonstrate that consumers can be expected to understand the meaning of the term under the proposed conditions of use.</P>
                <P>(iii) Analytical data that demonstrates the amount of the nutrient that is present in the products for which the claim is intended. The assays should be performed on representative samples in accordance with 317.309(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the nutrient in the particular food. The validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.</P>

                <P>(iv) A detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption, and any corresponding changes in nutrient intake. The analysis shall specifically address the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group.

              <P>(2) A special dietary product may contain a nonnutritive sweetener or other ingredient only if the ingredient is safe for use in the product under the applicable law and regulations of this chapter. Any product that achieves its special dietary usefulness in reducing or maintaining body weight through the use of a nonnutritive sweetener shall bear on its label the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not state the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive sweetener. If a nutritive sweetener(s) as well as nonnutritive sweetener(s) is added, the statement shall indicate the presence of both types of sweetener; e.g., “Sweetened with nutritive sweetener(s) and nonnutritive sweetener(s).”</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">“Label terms suggesting usefulness as low calorie or reduced calorie foods”.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, a product may be labeled with terms such as “diet,” “dietetic,” “artificially sweetened,” or “sweetened with nonnutritive sweetener” only if the claim is not false or misleading, and the product is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears another comparative calorie claim in compliance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms that is specifically authorized by regulation governing a particular food, or, unless otherwise restricted by regulation, to any use of the term “diet” that clearly shows that the product is offered solely for a dietary use other than regulating body weight, e.g., “for low sodium diets.”</P>

              <P>(3) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such <PRTPAGE P="237"/>terms on a formulated meal replacement or other product that is represented to be of special dietary use as a whole meal, pending the issuance of a regulation governing the use of such terms on foods.</P>

              <P>(ii) Multi-ingredient products (e.g., sausage) processed at a retail store or similar retail-type establishment, provided, however, that this exemption does not apply to multi-ingredient ground or chopped meat products described in § 317.301 that are processed at a retail establishment, unless the establishment qualifies for an exemption under (a)(1); and<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Products that are ground or chopped at an individual customer's request.</P>

              <P>(iv) The percent of the Daily Value for protein, vitamins, and minerals shall be listed immediately below the heading “Percent Daily Value”; and</P>
              <P>(v) Such labeling shall not include the footnote specified in § 317.309(d)(9).</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Products in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are exempt from nutrition labeling, provided that the labeling for these products bear no nutrition claims or other nutrition information, except that this exemption does not apply to the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat products identified in § 317.344.

              <SUBJECT>Products and other articles entering official establishments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section or § 318.12, no product shall be brought into an official establishment unless it has been prepared only in an official establishment and previously inspected and passed by a Program employee, and is identified by an official inspection legend as so inspected and passed. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph, product imported in accordance with part 327 of this subchapter and not prepared in the United States outside an official establishment, may enter any official establishment subject in other respects to the same restrictions as apply to domestic product. Products received in an official establishment during the Program employees absence shall be identified and maintained in a manner acceptable to such employee. Product entering any official establishment shall not be used or prepared thereat until it has been reinspected in accordance with § 318.2. Any product originally prepared at any official establishment may not be returned into any part of such establishment, except the receiving area approved under § 318.3, until it has been reinspected by the inspector.</P>

              <P>(b) No slaughtered poultry or poultry product shall be brought into an official establishment unless it has been (1) previously inspected and passed and is identified as such in accordance with the requirements of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the regulations thereunder, and has not been prepared other than in an establishment inspected under said Act, or (2) has been inspected and passed and is identified as such in accordance with the requirements of a State law.</P>

              <P>(c) Every article for use as an ingredient in the preparation of meat food products, when entering any official establishment and at all times while it is in such establishment, shall bear a label showing the name of the article, the amount or percentage therein of any substances restricted by this part or part 317 of this subchapter, and a list of ingredients in the article if composed of two or more ingredients: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in the case of articles received in tank car lots, only one such label shall be used to identify each lot. In addition, the label must show the name and address of the shipper.</P>
              <P>(d) To ensure the safe use of preparations used in hog scalding water or in the denuding of tripe, the label or labeling on containers of such preparations shall bear adequate directions to ensure use in compliance with any limitations prescribed in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter A or Subchapter E.</P>
              <P>(e) Dyes, chemicals, or other substances the use of which is restricted to certain products may be brought into or kept in an official establishment only if such products are prepared thereat. No prohibited dye, chemical, preservative, or other substance shall be brought into or kept in an official establishment.</P>
              <P>(f) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(g) Glands and organs, such as cotyledons, ovaries, prostate glands, tonsils, spinal cords, and detached lymphatic, pineal, pituitary, parathyroid, suprarenal, pancreatic and thyroid glands, used in preparing pharmaceutical, organotherapeutic, or technical products and which are not used as human food (whether or not prepared at official establishments) may be brought into and stored in edible product departments of inspected establishments if packaged in suitable <PRTPAGE P="240"/>containers so that the presence of such glands and organ will in no way interfere with the maintenance of sanitary conditions or constitute an interference with inspection. Glands or organs which are regarded as human food products, such as livers, testicles, and thymus glands, may be brought into official establishments for pharmaceutical, organotherapeutic or technical purposes, only if U.S. inspected and passed and so identified. Lungs and lung lobes derived from livestock slaughtered in any establishment may not be brought into any official establishment except as provided in § 318.12(a).</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Carcasses of game animals, and carcasses derived from the slaughter by any person of livestock of his own raising in accordance with the exemption provisions of paragraph 23(a) of the Act, and parts of such carcasses, may be brought into an official establishment for preparation, packaging, and storing in accordance with the provisions of § 303.1(a)(2) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products bearing official marks showing that they were inspected and passed under State inspection in any State not designated in § 331.2 of this subchapter may be received by official establishments for storage and distribution solely in intrastate commerce. The presence of such State inspected products must not create any unsanitary condition or otherwise result in adulteration of any products at the official establishment or interfere with the conduct of inspection under this subchapter. In addition, such State inspected products must be stored separately and apart from the federally inspected products in the official establishment.</P>
              <P>(i) The operator of the official establishment shall furnish such information as is necessary to determine the origin of any product or other article entering the official establishment. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the name and address of the seller or supplier, transportation company, agent, or broker involved in the sale or delivery of the product or article in question.</P>
              <P>(j) Any product or any poultry or poultry product or other article that is brought into an official establishment contrary to any provision of this section may be required by the Administrator to be removed immediately from such establishment by the operator thereof, and failure to comply with such requirement shall be deemed a violation of this regulation. If any slaughtered poultry or poultry products or other articles are received at an official establishment and are suspected of being adulterated or misbranded under the Poultry Products Inspection Act or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or applicable State laws, the appropriate governmental authorities will be notified.</P>

              <P>(a) All products and all slaughtered poultry and poultry products brought into any official establishment shall be identified by the operator of the official establishment at the time of receipt at the official establishment and shall be subject to reinspection by a Program employee at the official establishment in such manner and at such times as may be deemed necessary to assure compliance with the regulations in this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(b) All products, whether fresh, cured, or otherwise prepared, even though previously inspected and passed, shall be reinspected by Program employees as often as they may deem necessary in order to ascertain that they are not adulterated or misbranded at the time they enter or leave official establishments and that the requirements of the regulations in this subchapter are complied with.</P>

              <P>(c) Reinspection may be accomplished through use of statistically sound sampling plans that assure a high level of confidence.

                  <SU>1</SU> Further information concerning sampling plans which have been adopted for specific products may be obtained from the Circuit Supervisors of Program circuits. These sampling plans are developed for individual products by the Washington staff and will be distributed for field use as they are developed. The type of plan applicable depends on factors such as whether the product is in containers, stage of preparation, and procedures followed by the establishment operator. The specific plan applicable depends on the kind of product involved, such as liver, oxtails, etc.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(d) A U.S. retained tag shall be placed by a Program employee at the time of reinspection at any official establishment on all products which are suspected on such reinspection of being adulterated or misbranded, and such products shall be held for further inspection. Such tags shall be removed only by authorized Program employees. When further inspection is made, if the product is found to be adulterated, all official inspection legends or other official marks for which the product is found to be ineligible under the regulations in this subchapter, shall be removed or defaced and the product will be subject to condemnation and disposal in accordance with part 314 of this subchapter, except that a determination regarding adulteration may be deferred if a product has become soiled or unclean by falling on the floor or in any other accidental way or if the product is affected with any other condition which the inspector deems capable of correction, in which case the product shall be cleaned (including trimming if necessary) or otherwise handled in a manner approved by the inspector to assure that it will not be adulterated or misbranded and shall then be presented for reinspection and disposal in accordance with this section. If upon final inspection, the product is found to be neither adulterated nor misbranded, the inspector shall remove the U.S. retained tag. If a product is found upon reinspection to be misbranded, it shall be held under a U.S. retained tag, or a U.S. detention tag as provided in part 329 of this subchapter, pending correction of the misbranding or issuance of an order under section 7 of the Act to withhold from use the labeling or container of the product, or the institution of a judicial seizure action under section 403 of Act or other appropriate action. The inspector shall make a complete record of each transaction under this paragraph and shall report his action to the area supervisor.</P>

              <P>(a) All processes used in curing, pickling, rendering, canning, or otherwise preparing any product in official establishments shall be supervised by Program employees unless such preparation is conducted as a custom operation exempted from inspection under § 303.1(a)(2) of this subchapter in any official establishment or consists of operations that are exempted from inspection under § 303.1(d) of this subchapter and are conducted in a retail store in an establishment subject to inspection only because the State or Territory in which the establishment is located is designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act. No fixtures or appliances, such as tables, trucks, trays, tanks, vats, machines, implements, cans, or containers of any kind, shall be used unless they are of such materials and construction as will not contaminate or otherwise adulterate the product and are clean and sanitary. All steps in the preparation of edible products shall be conducted carefully and with strict cleanliness in rooms or compartments separate from those used for inedible products.</P>

              <P>(b) It shall be the responsibility of the operator of every official establishment to comply with the Act and the <PRTPAGE P="242"/>regulations in this subchapter.

Such a request shall, as a minimum, include:</P>
              <P>(1) A letter to the Administrator from the establishment owner of operator stating the company's basis and purpose for seeking an approved quality control system and willingness to adhere to the requirements of the system as approved by the Department; that all the establishment's data, analyses, and information generated by its quality control system will be maintained to enable the Department to monitor compliance and available to Department personnel; that plant quality control personnel will have authority to halt production or shipping of product in cases where the submitted quality control system requires it; and that the owner or operator (or his/her designee) will be available for consultation at any time Department personnel consider it necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of an establishment having one or more full-time persons whose primary duties are related to the quality control system, an organizational chart showing that such people ultimately report to an establishment official whose quality control responsibilities are independent of or not predominantly production responsibilities. In the case of an establishment which does not have full-time quality control personnel, information indicating the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the person who will be responsible for the quality control system.</P>
              <P>(3) A list identifying those parts and sections of the Federal meat inspection regulations which are applicable to the operations of the establishment applying for approval of a quality control system. This list shall also identify which part of the quality control system will serve to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations.</P>

              <P>(4) Detailed information concerning the manner in which the system will function. Such information should include, but not necessarily be limited to, questions of raw material control, the critical check or control points, the nature and frequency of tests to be made, the nature of charts and other records that will be used, the length of time such charts and records will be maintained in the custody of the official establishment, the nature of deficiencies the quality control system is designed to identify and control, the parameters or limits which will be used, and the points at which corrective action will occur and the nature of such corrective action—ranging from least to most severe: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, subsequent to approval of the total plant quality control system by the Administrator, the official establishment may produce a new product for test marketing provided labeling for the product has been approved by the Administrator, the inspector in charge has determined that the procedures for preparing the product will assure that all Federal requirements are met, and the production for test marketing does not exceed 6 months. Such new product shall not be produced at that establishment after the 6-month period unless approval of the quality control system for that product has been received from the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Evaluation and Approval of Total Plant Quality Control.</E> (1) The Administrator shall evaluate the material presented in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. If it is determined by the Administrator, <PRTPAGE P="243"/>on the basis of the evaluation, that the total quality control system will result in finished products controlled in this manner being in full compliance with the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder, the total quality control system will be approved and plans will be made for implementation under departmental supervision.</P>
              <P>(2) In any situation where the system is found by the Administrator to be unacceptable, formal notification shall be given to the applicant of the basis for the denial. The applicant will be afforded an opportunity to modify the system in accordance with the notification. The applicant shall also be afforded an opportunity to submit a written statement in response to this notification of denial and a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial. If the applicant requests a hearing and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, he shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer and the request for hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with Rules of Practice which shall be adopted for this proceeding.</P>
              <P>(3) The establishment owner or operator shall be responsible for the effective operation of the approved total plant quality control system to assure compliance with the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder. The Secretary shall continue to provide the Federal inspection necessary to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.</P>

              <P>(2) The approval of a total plant quality control system may be terminated upon the establishment's receipt of a written notice from the Administrator under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) If adulterated or misbranded meat food product is found by the Administrator to have been prepared for or distributed in commerce by the subject establishment. In such case, opportunity will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to present views to the Administrator within 30 days of the date of terminating the approval. In those instances where there is conflict of facts, a hearing, under applicable Rules of Practice, will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to resolve the conflict. The Administrator's termination of approval shall remain in effect pending the final determination of the proceeding.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the establishment fails to comply with the quality control system or program to which it has agreed after being notified by letter from the Administrator or his designee. Prior to such termination, opportunity will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to present views to the Administrator within 30 days of the date of the letter.

Establishments that use casings derived from the small intestine of cattle as containers for products must demonstrate, through documentation, that the small intestine from which the casing was derived complies with the requirements in 9 CFR 310.22(d).</P>
              <P>(2) Casings for products shall be carefully inspected by Program employees. Only those casings which have been carefully washed and thoroughly flushed with clean water immediately before stuffing and are suitable for containers, are clean, and are passed on such inspection shall be used, except that preflushed animal casings packed in salt or salt and glycerine solution or other approved medium may be used without additional flushing provided they are found to be clean and otherwise acceptable and are thoroughly rinsed before use.</P>
              <P>(3) Hog and sheep casings intended for use as containers of product may be treated by soaking in or applying thereto sound, fresh pineapple juice or papain or bromelin or pancreatic extract to permit the enzymes contained in these substances to act on the casings to make them less resistant. The casings shall be handled in a clean and sanitary manner throughout and the treatment shall be followed by washing and flushing the casings with water sufficiently to effectively remove the substance used and terminate the enzymatic action.</P>
              <P>(4) On account of the invariable presence of bone splinters, detached spinal cords shall not be used in the preparation of edible product other than for rendering where they constitute a suitable raw material. Detached spinal cords from cattle 30 months of age and older shall not be used as raw materials for edible rendering.</P>
              <P>(5) Testicles if handled as an edible product may be shipped from the official establishment as such, but they shall not be used as an ingredient of a meat food product.</P>
              <P>(6) Tonsils shall be removed and shall not be used as ingredients of meat food products.</P>

              <P>(7) Blood from livestock prepared in accordance with § 310.20 of this subchapter may be used as an ingredient of a meat food product for which a standard is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter, if permitted by such standard, and may be used in any meat food product for which no such standard is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter if it is a common and usual ingredient of such product.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) Intestines shall not be used as ingredients in any meat food product for which a standard is prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter and shall not be used in other products unless the products are labeled in accordance with § 317.8(b)(3) of this subchapter. When small intestine from cattle is used in a meat food product or for edible rendering, it must comply with the requirements in 9 CFR 310.22(d).</P>
              <P>(9) Poultry products and egg products (other than shell eggs) which are intended for use as ingredients of meat food products shall be considered acceptable for such use only when identified as having been inspected and passed for wholesomeness by the Department under the regulations in 7 CFR part 59 or 9 CFR part 362 or 381 and when found to be sound and otherwise acceptable when presented for use. Poultry products and egg products (other than shell eggs) which have not been so inspected and passed for wholesomeness shall not be used in the preparation of such meat food products.</P>

              <P>(a) Preservatives and other substances not permitted in domestic product under the regulations in this subchapter may be used in the preparation and packing of product intended for export provided the product (1) accords to the specifications or directions of the foreign purchaser; (2) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it is intended for export; and (3) is labeled on the outside container to show that it is intended for export, and is otherwise labeled as required by this subchapter for such export product.</P>
              <P>(b) The preparation and packing of export product as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be done in a manner acceptable to the inspector in charge so that the identity of the export product is maintained conclusively and the preparation of domestic product is adequately protected. The preservatives and other substances not permitted in domestic product shall be stored in a room or compartment separate from areas used to store other supplies and shall be held under Program lock. Use of the preservatives or other substances shall be under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</P>
              <P>(c) The packing of all articles under paragraph (a) of this section shall be conducted under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</P>
              <P>(d) No article prepared or packed for export under paragraph (a) of this section shall be sold or offered for sale for domestic use or consumption, but unless exported shall be destroyed for food purposes under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</P>

              <P>(e) The contents of the container of any article prepared or packed for export under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be removed, in whole or in part, from such container prior to exportation, except under the supervision of a Program employee. If such contents are removed prior to exportation, then the article shall be either repacked, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this <PRTPAGE P="247"/>section, or destroyed for food purposes under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</P>

              <P>(h) Salt used for bulking meat previously packed in borax may not again be used in an edible products department other than in connection with the packing of meat in borax. Only metal equipment should be used for handling such meat. Particularly effective cleansing will be required if wooden equipment such as trucks, washing vats, etc., is used. Boxes from which boraxed meat has been removed may be used for repacking meat in borax, but their use as containers for other meat will be dependent upon the effective removal of all traces of borax.</P>
              <P>(i) The following instructions pertain to export cured pork packed in borax for the account of Federal agencies. The meat may be packed in borax in a room in which there is borax-free meat, provided proper care is taken to see that the borax-free meat is not affected by the borax. Under the same condition, meat packed in borax may be received, unpacked, defrosted, soaked, washed, smoked, and repacked in a room where there is other meat. However, meat originally packed in borax shall at all times be subject to the restrictions of meat so packed, even though repacked without borax. After packing or repacking, borax packed meat may be stored in a room with meat not packed in borax, provided a reasonable degree of separation is maintained between the two classes of product.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Criteria to determine sampling frequency of Product Groups.</E> For each official plant preparing cured pork products, Product Groups shall be sampled periodically or daily. Analytical results shall be evaluated and the sampling frequency determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Determine the difference between the individual PFF analysis and the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105. The resulting figure shall be negative when the individual sample result is less than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive when the individual sample result is greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement.</P>
              <P>(ii) Divide the resulting number by the standard deviation assigned to the Product Group represented by the sample to find the Standardized Difference. The standard deviation assigned to Groups I and II is 0.75 and to Groups III and IV is 0.91.</P>

              <P>(iii) Add 0.25 to the Standardized Difference to find the Adjusted Standardized Difference.<PRTPAGE P="251"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Use the lesser of 1.90 and the Adjusted Standardized Difference as the Sample Value.</P>
              <P>(v) Cumulatively total Sample Values to determine the Group Value. The first Sample Value in a Group shall be the Group Value, and each succeeding Group Value shall be determined by adding the most recent Sample Value to the existing Group Value; provided, however, that in no event shall the Group Value exceed 1.00. When calculation of a Group Value results in a figure greater than 1.00, the Group Value shall be 1.00 and all previous Sample Values shall be ignored in determining future Group Values.</P>
              <P>(vi) The frequency of sampling of a Group shall be periodic when the Group Value is greater than −1.40 (e.g., −1.39, −1.14, 0, 0.50, etc.) and shall be daily when the Group Value is −1.40 or less (e.g., −1.40, −1.45, −1.50, etc.); provided, however, that once daily sampling has been initiated, it shall continue until the Group Value is 0.00 or greater, and each of the last seven Sample Values is −1.65 or greater (e.g., −1.63, −1.50, etc.), and there is no other product within the affected Group being U.S. retained as produced, under provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (c).</P>

Such administratively detained product shall be handled in accordance with part 329 of this subchapter, or shall be returned to an official establishment and subjected to the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, or shall be relabeled in compliance with the applicable standard, under the supervision of a program employee, at the expense of the product owner. Disposition of such U.S. retained product shall be in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Product Value requirement.</E> The Department shall maintain, for each product prepared in an official establishment, a Product Value. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, calculation of the Product Value and its use to determine if a product shall be U.S. retained shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Determine the difference between the individual PFF analysis and applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement of § 319.104 and § 319.105. The resulting figure shall be negative when the individual sample result is less than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive when the individual sample result is greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement.</P>
              <P>(B) Divide the difference determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the standard deviation assigned to the product's Group in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section to find the standardized difference.</P>
              <P>(C) Use the lesser of 1.65 and the standardized difference as the Sample Value.</P>

              <P>(D) Cumulatively total Sample Values to determine the Product Value. The first Sample Value of a product shall be the Product Value, and each succeeding Product Value shall be determined by adding the most recent Sample Value to the existing Product Value; provided, however, that in no event shall the Product Value exceed 1.15. When calculation of a Product Value results in a figure greater than 1.15, the Product Value shall be 1.15, and all previous Sample Values shall be ignored in determining future Product Values.<PRTPAGE P="252"/>

Except for release of individual lot pursuant to paragraph (c)(1), subsequently produced lots of like product shall continue to be U.S. retained until discontinued pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance procedure during product retention.</E> When a product lot is U.S. retained under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Department shall collect three randomly selected samples from each such lot and analyze them individually for PFF content. The PFF content of the three samples shall be evaluated to determine disposition of the lot as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the action to be taken on subsequently produced lots of like product as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. <SU>3</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(1) A product lot which is U.S. retained under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be released for entry into commerce provided one of the following conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(i) The average PFF content of the three samples randomly selected from the lot is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage required by § 319.104 or § 319.105. Further processing to remove moisture for the purpose of meeting this provision is permissible. In lieu of further analysis to determine the effects of such processing, each 0.37 percent weight reduction due to moisture loss resulting from the processing may be considered the equivalent of a 0.1 percent PFF gain.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lot of the product is relabeled to conform to the provisions of § 319.104 or § 319.105, under the supervision of a program employee.</P>
              <P>(iii) The lot is one that has been prepared subsequent to preparation of the lot which, under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, resulted in discontinuance of U.S. retention of new lots of like product. Such lot may be released for entry into commerce prior to receipt of analytical results for which sampling has been conducted. Upon receipt of such results, they shall be subjected to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The PFF content of three randomly selected samples from each U.S. retained lot shall be used to maintain the Product Value described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii). The manner and effect of such maintenance shall be as follows: (i) Find the average PFF content of the three samples.</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine the difference between that average and the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105. The resulting figure shall be negative when the average of the sample results is less than the applicable minimum PFF percentage requirement and shall be positive when the average of the sample results is greater than the applicable minimum PFF requirements.</P>

              <P>(iv) Use the lesser of 1.30 and the standardized difference as the Sample Value.</P>

              <P>(v) Add the first Sample Value thus calculated to the latest Product Value calculated under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to find the new Product Value. To find each succeeding Product Value, add the most recent Sample Value to the existing Product Value; provided, however, that in no event shall the Product Value exceed 1.15. When the addition of a Sample Value to an existing Product Value results in a figure greater than 1.15, the Product Value shall be 1.15 and <PRTPAGE P="253"/>all previous Sample Values shall be ignored in determining future Product Values.</P>
              <P>(vi) New lots of like product shall continue to be retained pending disposition in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section until, after 5 days of production, the Product Value is 0.00 or greater, and the PFF content of no individual sample from a U.S. retained lot is less than the Absolute Minimum PFF requirement specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Should an individual sample fail to meet its Absolute Minimum PFF requirement, the 5-day count shall begin anew.</P>
              <P>(vii) When U.S. retention of new lots is discontinued under the above provisions, maintenance of the Product Value shall revert to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this section, the plant owner or operator shall have the option of temporarily removing a product from its Product Group, provided product lots are being U.S. retained, as produced, and provided further that the average production rate of the product, over the 8-week period preceding the week in which the first U.S. retained lot was prepared, is not greater than 20 percent of the production rate of its Group. When a product is thus removed from its Group, analytical results of product samples shall not cause daily sampling of the Group. When pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, new lots of the product are no longer being U.S. retained, the product shall again be considered with its Group.</P>

With respect to any other cured pork product, official establishments may institute quality control procedures under § 318.4 of this subchapter. Cured pork products produced in such establishments may be exempt from the requirements of this section, provided in plant quality control procedures are shown to attain the same or higher degree of compliance as the procedures set forth in this section; provided, however, that all cured pork products produced shall be subject to the applicable Absolute Minimum PFF content requirement, regardless of any quality control procedures in effect.</P>

                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> The excessive iron (ExcFe) measurement for an analyzed sample is equal to the obtained iron (Fe) result expressed in mg/100 g measured and rounded to the nearest 100th or more for that sample, minus the product of three factors: (1) The iron to protein ratio (IPR) factor associated with corresponding hand-deboned product; (2) the obtained protein (P) result (%) for that sample; and (3) a constant factor of 1.10. In formula, this can be written as: ExcFe = mFe − IPR × Protein × 1.10, where ExcFe represents the excess iron, expressed in units of mg/100 g; mFe represents the measured level of iron (Fe, mg/100 g), IPR is the iron to protein ratio for the appropriate hand-deboned product, and “Protein” is the measured level of protein rounded to the nearest 100th and expressed as a percentage of the total weight of the sample. In lieu of data demonstrating otherwise, the values of IPR to be used in the above formula are as follows: For beef products the value of IPR is equal to 0.104, except for any combination of bones that include any beef neckbone product, for which the value of 0.138 is to be used; for pork product, the IPR value is 0.052. Other IPR values can be used provided that the operator of an establishment has verified and documented the ratio of iron content to protein content in the skeletal muscle tissue attached to bones prior to their entering the AMR system, based on analyses of hand-deboned samples, and the documented value is to be substituted for the IPR value (as applicable) in the above formula with respect to product that the establishment mechanically separates from those bones.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mechanically Separated (Species).</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Mechanically Separated (Species) is any finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses and meeting the other provisions of this paragraph. Examples of such product are “Mechanically Separated Beef”, <PRTPAGE P="259"/>“Mechanically Separated Veal”, “Mechanically Separated Pork”, and “Mechanically Separated Lamb”. At least 98 percent of the bone particles present in such product shall have a maximum size no greater than 0.5 millimeter in their greatest dimension and there shall be no bone particles larger than 0.85 millimeter in their greatest dimension. The product resulting from the separating process shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.75 percent, as a measure of a bone solids content of not more than 3 percent, and shall have a minimum PER of 2.5 (except as modified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section). Such product also shall have a protein content of not less than 14 percent and a fat content of not more than 30 percent, or it shall be deemed to be product for processing. Such product failing to meet the bone particle size, calcium, or PER requirements of this paragraph shall only be used in producing animal fats. Where such product meets the bone particle size, calcium, and PER requirements of this paragraph, it may also be used in the formulation of meat food products in accordance with § 319.6.</P>
              <P>(b) Mechanically Separated (Beef) is inedible and prohibited for use as human food.</P>
              <P>(c)-(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e)(1) An essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids presents in “Mechanically Separated (Species)” shall be accepted as evidence of compliance with the protein quality requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The meat food products prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those products that substitute, in accordance with § 317.313(d), for a standardized product defined in this part and use the name of that standardized product in their statements of identity, but that do not comply with the established standard because of a compositional deviation that results from reduction of a constituent that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by regulation in part 317, subpart B, of this subchapter. The expressed nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 317.313 of this subchapter and with the requirements of part 317, subpart B, of this subchapter which define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The meat food product shall comply with the relevant standard in this part in all other respects, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance characteristics.</E> The performance characteristics, such as physical properties, functional properties, and shelf-life, of the meat food product shall be similar to those of the standardized meat food product produced under this part. If there is a significant difference in a performance characteristic that materially limits the use of the product compared to the use of the standardized product defined in this part, the label shall include a statement in accordance with § 317.313(d)(1) and (2) of this subchapter that informs the consumer of such differences (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, if appropriate, “not recommended for frozen storage” or “not suitable for roller grilling”). Deviations from the ingredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim, while maintaining similar performance characteristics.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ingredients used in substitute products.</E> (1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for in the standard as defined in this part, except that safe and suitable ingredients permitted for use in meat food products as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, may be used at the minimum level necessary to improve texture and prevent syneresis, so that the substitute product is not inferior in performance characteristics from the standardized product defined in this part for which it is a substitute.</P>
              <P>(2) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard prescribed in this part shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source, for example, turnip chunks shall not replace potatoes in corned beef hash.</P>
              <P>(3) An ingredient that is specifically prohibited from use in any meat food product by this part shall not be added to the substitute meat food product under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless otherwise specified in this part, a substitute meat food product must meet all other requirements of the applicable standards of identity or composition.</P>
              <P>(5) Water and fat-replacers (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, binders), in combination, may be added to replace fat in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) Textured vegetable protein may be used by itself or in combination with other binders and water as a fat replacer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Nomenclature.</E> The name of a substitute meat food product that complies with all parts of this section is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> (1) Each of the ingredients used in the substitute meat food product shall be declared on the <PRTPAGE P="261"/>label as required by this section and part 317 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in this part, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular ____” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product) or “**Ingredients in excess of amounts permitted in regular ____” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product), or both, as appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same type and size.</P>

            <P>(a) The Administrator is authorized under paragraph (a) of section 301 of the Act, when he determines it would effectuate the purposes of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized Territory in developing and administering the meat inspection program of such jurisdiction with a view to assuring that it imposes and enforces requirements at least equal to those under Titles I and IV of the Act, with respect to establishments at which products are prepared for use as human food solely for distribution within such jurisdiction, and with respect to the products of such establishments. Such cooperation is authorized if the jurisdiction has enacted a law imposing mandatory ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, and sanitation requirements at least equal to the Federal requirements with respect to all or certain classes of persons engaged in slaughtering livestock or otherwise preparing products solely for distribution within such jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(b) The Administrator is also authorized under paragraph (a) of section 301 of the Act to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized Territory in developing and administering programs under the laws of such jurisdiction containing authorities at least equal to those in Title II of the Act (relating to records; registration of specified classes of operators; dead, dying, disabled, or diseased livestock; and products not intended for human food), when he determines that such cooperation would effectuate the purposes of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) Such cooperation may include advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial aid. The Federal contribution to any State (or Territory) may not exceed 50 percent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative State (or Territorial) program. A cooperative program under this section is called a State-Federal program.</P>

            <P>Under the “Talmadge-Aiken Act” of September 28, 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450), the Administrator is authorized to utilize employees and facilities of any State in carrying out Federal functions under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a Federal-State program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Cooperation of States for the interstate shipment of carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Administrator is authorized under 21 U.S.C. 683(b) to coordinate with States that have meat inspection programs as provided in § 321.1 of this part to select certain establishments operating under these programs to participate in a cooperative program to ship carcasses, parts of carcasses, <PRTPAGE P="280"/>meat, and meat food products in interstate commerce. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a “cooperative interstate shipment program.”</P>
            <P>(b) Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program described in this section must receive inspection services from designated State personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel determine that the carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products prepared in establishments selected to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce. The Administrator will assign an FSIS “selected establishment coordinator,” who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's requirements. The Federal contribution for inspection services provided by States that enter into a cooperative interstate shipment program under this section will be at least 60 percent of eligible State costs. Eligible State costs are those costs that a State has justified and FSIS has approved as necessary for the State to provide inspection services to selected establishments in the State.</P>
            <P>(c) Part 332 of this subchapter prescribes conditions under which States and establishments may participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program.</P>
            <P>(d) The Administrator will terminate a cooperative interstate shipment agreement with a State if the Administrator determines that the State is not conducting inspection at selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) No person shall sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce, any product which is capable of use as human food unless the product and its container, if any, bear the official inspection legend as required under parts 316 and 317 of this subchapter or such product is exempted from the requirement of inspection under part 303 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) No carrier shall transport or receive for transportation in commerce (including transportation in the course of importation) and no person shall offer for transportation any carcass, part thereof, meat or meat food product until a certificate, if required for such transportation by this part, is made and furnished to the carrier in one of the forms prescribed in this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Product imported into the United States may be transported and offerred or received for transportation if such product is conveyed in railroad cars, trucks or other means of conveyance, prior to inspection, to an authorized place of inspection, as provided in § 327.6 of this part.</P>

            <P>(c) No person, engaged in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for commerce, meat or meat food products capable of use as human food, or importing such articles, shall transport, offer for transportation, or receive for transportation in commerce or in any State designated under § 331.2 of this subchapter, any such meat or meat food product which is capable of use as human food and is not wrapped, packaged, or otherwise enclosed to prevent adulteration by airborne contaminants, unless the railroad car, truck, or other means of conveyance in which the product is contained or transported is completely enclosed with tight fitting doors or other covers for all openings. In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated. Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must be thoroughly removed from the means of conveyance prior to its use. Such means of conveyance onto which product is loaded, being loaded, or intended to be loaded, shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at any official establishment. The decision whether or not to inspect a means of conveyance in a specific case, and the type and extent of such inspection shall be at the Program's discretion and shall be adequate to determine if product in such conveyance is, or when moved could become, adulterated. Circumstances of transport that can be reasonably anticipated shall be considered in making said determination. These include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, duration and distance of trip, nature of product covering, and effect of restowage at stops en route. Any means of <PRTPAGE P="283"/>conveyance found upon such inspection to be in such condition that product placed therein could become adulterated shall not be used until such condition which could cause adulteration is corrected. Product placed in any means of conveyance that is found by the inspector to be in such condition that the product may have become adulterated shall be removed from the means of conveyance and handled in accordance with § 318.2(d) of this subchapter.</P>

            <P>(a) Products passed for cooking, and beef that is to be refrigerated to destroy cysticerci, may be shipped loose from one official establishment to any other official establishment, for further handling in accordance with part 318 of this subchapter, in railroad cars, trucks, or other means of conveyance sealed with the official seal of the Department as prescribed in § 325.16: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in the case of railroad cars, the receiving establishment has railroad facilities for unloading the products directly into the establishment.</P>
            <P>(b) When such restricted product is shipped from one official establishment to another official establishment in the same railroad car or other means of conveyance with other product, such restricted product shall be packed in individual closed containers as hereinafter provided. Containers shall be sealed by firmly applying a pressure sensitive tape around each container in two directions and stamping the intersection of the tape with the marking device described in § 312.2(a) of this subchapter for use on burlap, muslin, etc. (2<FR>1/2</FR>-inch rubber brand). Such tape must possess the adhesive property to actually remove a portion of the container surface when the tape is removed.

The imprint of the marking device shall be placed partially on the strap and partially on the container. Such restricted product shall be marked “U.S. passed for cooking” or “pork product __ °F. __days refrigeration” or “beef passed for refrigeration,” as the case may be. In addition, a “U.S. retained” tag shall be securely affixed to each container of product passed for cooking and of beef passed for refrigeration. The means of conveyance shall not be sealed unless at least 25 percent of the other product in the vehicle is unmarked. For each consignment there shall be promptly issued and forwarded by the inspector to the inspector in charge at destination, a report on the form entitled “Notice of Unmarked Meats Shipped in Sealed Cars,” appropriately modified to show the character of the containers, and that the contents are restricted. A duplicate copy shall be retained in the program files.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Handling of products which may have become adulterated or misbranded; authorization and other requirements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) When it is claimed that any inspected and passed product, marked with an inspection legend, has become adulterated or misbranded after it has been transported from an official establishment, such product may be transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral permission is obtained from the area supervisor of the area in which that offical establishment is located. The transportation of the product may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported or to another official establishment designated by the person <PRTPAGE P="286"/>desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for the purpose of officially determining if the product has become adulterated or misbranded and making the appropriate disposition. The area supervisor shall make a record of the authorization and such other information which will effectively identify the shipment and shall provide a copy of the record to the inspector at the establishment receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.</P>

            <P>(b) Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment, a careful inspection shall be made of the product by a Program inspector, and if it is found that the article is not adulterated, the same may be received into the establishment; but if the article is found to be adulterated, it shall at once be stamped “U.S. inspected and condemned” and disposed of in accordance with part 314 of this subchapter, and if it is found to be misbranded, it shall be handled in accordance with § 318.2(d) of this subchapter: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That when a product is found to be affected with one of the correctable conditions specified in § 318.2(d) of this subchapter, in respect to which rehandling is permitted, it may be transported from the official establishment to another official establishment for such rehandling as is necessary to assure that the product is not adulterated or misbranded when finally released. The transportation of such a product from an official establishment shall be done in a manner prescribed in each specific case by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>(b) Inedible rendered animal fats from official or other establishments in the United States having the physical characteristics of a meat food product fit for human food may be transported in commerce without denaturing, if the following conditions are met:</P>
            <P>(1) Such inedible rendered fat shall not be bought, sold, transported, or offered for sale or offered for transportation in commerce, or imported, except by rendering companies, dealers, brokers, or others who obtain a numbered permit for such activities from the Regional Director.</P>

            <P>(2) Such inedible rendered animal fat may be so distributed only if consigned to a domestic manufacturer of technical articles other than for human food or to an export terminal for exportation or storage for exportation as an inedible article, and provided, in the case of such fat consigned to a domestic manufacturer, the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing purposes of nonhuman food articles and may not be further sold or shipped without first receiving approval of the Regional Director: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That such fat intended for export and stored at a terminal point prior to export will be subject to review by Program employees to assure that it is exported as inedible.</P>
            <P>(3) When transported in commerce, or imported, such inedible rendered fat shall be marked conspicuously with the words “technical animal fat not intended for human food” on the ends of the shipping containers, in letters not less than 2 inches high; in the case of shipping containers such as drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks. All shipping containers shall have both ends painted with a durable paint, if necessary, to provide a contrasting background for the required marking.</P>

            <P>(4) Such inedible rendered fat shall be transported only in sealed shipping <PRTPAGE P="287"/>containers bearing unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned by said Director for the permit holder. The number shall appear on the bill of lading or other transportation documents for the shipment. The consignees in the United States must retain the seals in their records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(5) Any diversion or effort to divert inedible rendered fat contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (b) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of technical animal fat at the discretion of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(c) Inedible rendered animal fat derived from condemned or other inedible materials at official or other establishments in the United States may be transported in commerce if mixed with low grade offal or other materials which render the fat readily distinguishable from an article of human food, and if the outside container bears the word “inedible.”</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, or in §§ 314.10 and 314.11 of this subchapter, no animal food prepared, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of livestock in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or imported, unless:</P>
            <P>(i) It is properly identified as animal food;</P>
            <P>(ii) It is not represented as being a human food; and</P>
            <P>(iii) It has been denatured as prescribed in § 325.13(a)(2) so as to be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of livestock and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the meat food industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 325.13(a)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 325.13(a)(2) if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appeared on the label in a conspicuous manner.</P>
            <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (d)(3), the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from the carcasses of livestock.</P>

            <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the provisons of paragraph (i) of this paragraph (d)(3), the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains livestock-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Horsemeat for Pets” or “Beef Stew for Dogs”: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass, but shall not be less than <FR>1/8</FR> inches high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.</P>

            <P>(iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in <PRTPAGE P="288"/>the article of livestock carcass-source material contrast with their background.</P>
            <P>(4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feeds manufactured from processed livestock byproducts (such as meat meal tankage, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and feed grade animal fat), or to processed dry animal food.</P>
            <P>(e) Except for inedible rendered animal fats and lungs or lung lobes, inedible products (including condemned products only if condemned for causes specified in § 314.11 of this subchapter) which were prepared at any official establishment, or at any State inspected establishment in any State not listed in § 331.2 of this subchapter, and which have the physical characteristics of a product fit for human food, may be transported from an official establishment or in commerce, without denaturing as required by this subchapter, if the following conditions are met:</P>
            <P>(1) The shipper must have obtained a numbered permit for such activity from the appropriate Regional Director, as identified in § 301.2 of this subchapter. Such permit may be obtained upon written application to the appropriate Regional Director and his determination that the proposed transportation would be authorized under this paragraph (e). The application shall state the name and address of the applicant, a description of the type of his business operations, and the purpose of making such application.</P>
            <P>(2) Such inedible products may be transported under this paragraph (e) only if consigned to a manufacturer in the United States of articles other than for human food and if the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing articles not for human food. Such products may not be transported in commerce to any consignee other than the one to which they were originally shipped unless prior notice of the diversion is given to the appropriate Regional Director and a record identifying the new consignee is maintained by the shipper as required by § 320.1 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(3) When transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e), the outside container of such inedible products shall be marked conspicuously with the words “Inedible—Not Intended for Human Food” in letters not less than 2 inches high, in the case of containers, such as cartons, drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks used to transport such products not in other containers.</P>
            <P>(4) Such inedible products shall be transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e) only in railroad cars, trucks, or containers which bear unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned to the permit holder and an individual seal serial number assigned by the shipper; and the product so transported shall be accompanied by an invoice or bill of lading specifying the permit holder's identification number. The consignee in the United States must retain a record of the identification and serial numbers shown on the seals in his records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(5) Any diversion, or effort to divert, undenatured, inedible product contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (e) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of inedible products under this paragraph (e), at the discretion of the Administrator.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 327.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Eligibility of foreign countries for importation of products into the United States.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) Whenever it shall be determined by the Administrator that the system of meat inspection maintained by any foreign country, with respect to establishments preparing products in such country for export to the United States, insures compliance of such establishments and their products with requirements equivalent to all the inspection, building construction standards, and all other provisions of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter which are applied to official establishments in the United States, and their products, and that reliance can be placed upon certificates required under this part from authorities of such foreign country, notice of that fact will be given in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, products prepared in such establishments which are certified and approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, shall be eligible so far as this subchapter is concerned for importation into the United States from such foreign country after applicable requirements of this subchapter have been met.</P>
            <P>(2) The determination of acceptability of a foreign meat inspection system for purposes of this section shall be based on an evaluation of the foreign program in accordance with the following requirements and procedures:</P>
            <P>(i) The system shall have a program organized and administered by the national government of the foreign country. The system as implemented must provide standards equivalent to those of the Federal system of meat inspection in the United States with respect to:</P>
            <P>(A) Organizational structure and staffing, so as to insure uniform enforcement of the requisite laws and regulations in all establishments throughout the system at which products are prepared for export to the United States;</P>
            <P>(B) Ultimate control and supervision by the national government over the official activities of all employees or licensees of the system;</P>
            <P>(C) The assignment of competent, qualified inspectors;</P>

            <P>(D) Authority and responsibility of national inspection officials to enforce the requisite laws and regulations governing meat inspection and to certify or refuse to certify products intended for export;<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
            </P>
            <P>(E) Adequate administrative and technical support;</P>
            <P>(F) The inspection, sanitation, quality, species verification, and residue standards applied to products produced in the United States.</P>
            <P>(G) Other requirements of adequate inspection service as required by the regulations in this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(ii) The legal authority for the system and the regulations thereunder shall impose requirements equivalent to those governing the system of meat inspection organized and maintained in the United States with respect to:</P>
            <P>(A) Ante-mortem inspection of animals for slaughter and inspection of methods of slaughtering and handling in connection with slaughtering which shall be performed by veterinarians or by other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of the veterinarians;</P>
            <P>(B) Post-mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;</P>
            <P>(C) Official controls by the national government over establishment construction, facilities, and equipment;</P>
            <P>(D) Direct and continuous official supervision of slaughtering and preparation of product, by the assignment of inspectors to establishments certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to assure that adulterated or misbranded product is not prepared for export to the United States;</P>
            <P>(E) Complete separation of establishments certified under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation throughout all certified establishments;</P>
            <P>(F) Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for sanitary handling of product;</P>
            <P>(G) Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;</P>
            <P>(H) A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as set forth in part 417 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(I) Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or regulations in this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(iii) Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of product into the United States may request a determination of eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which the foreign meat inspection system is based and such other information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Determination of eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a country for importation of products into the United States depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign meat inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department, and the timely submission of such documents and other information related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system, including information required by paragraph (e) of section 20 of the Act, as the Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations required by this section of the regulations.</P>
            <P>(iv) The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those of the Federal system of meat inspection in the United States, are being met. The program as implemented must provide for the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Periodic supervisory visits by a representative of the foreign inspection system to each establishment certified in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section to ensure that requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section are being met: Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States;</P>

            <P>(B) Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign inspection <PRTPAGE P="295"/>system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in (A) through (H) of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, copies of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department at the time of that representative's review upon request by that representative to a responsible foreign meat inspection official: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such reports are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States; and</P>

            <P>(C) Random sampling of internal organs and fat of carcasses at the point of slaughter and the testing of such organs and fat, for such residues having been identified by the exporting country's meat inspection authorities or by this Agency as potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical techniques approved by the Administrator: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such testing is required only on samples taken from carcasses from which meat or meat food products intended for importation into the United States are produced.</P>
            <P>(3) Only those establishments that are determined and certified to the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program representatives at times prearranged with the foreign meat inspection system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed annually. Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of adulterated or misbranded product.</P>
            <P>(i) For a new establishment, or any establishment for which information from last year's electronic certification or paper certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name, address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only); the type of operations conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)). Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the process category).</P>
            <P>(ii) If the establishment information provided on the preceding year's electronic foreign establishment certification or paper certificate, as required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has not changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date, the foreign country, the foreign establishment's name, and the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only).</P>

            <P>(4) Meat and meat food products from foreign countries not deemed eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section are not eligible for importation into the United States, except as provided by § 327.16 or § 327.17. Eligibility of any foreign country under this section may be withdrawn whenever the Administrator determines that the system of meat inspection maintained by such foreign country does not assure compliance with requirements equivalent to all the inspection, building construction standards, and other requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter as applied to official establishments in the United States; or that reliance cannot be placed upon certificates required under this part from authorities of such foreign country; or that, for lack of current information concerning the system of meat inspection being maintained by such foreign country, such foreign country <PRTPAGE P="296"/>should be required to reestablish its eligibility.</P>

            <P>(b) A list of countries eligible to export specific process categories of meat and meat food products is maintained at <E T="03">http://www.fsis.usda.gov/importlibrary.</E> Meat and meat food products from listed countries must be accompanied by foreign inspection certificates of the country of origin, as required by § 327.4, and are eligible under the regulations in this subchapter for entry into the United States after inspection and marking as required by the applicable provisions of this part. Fresh, chilled, or frozen or other product from countries in which rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever exist, as provided in part 94 of this title, are ineligible for importation into the United States.</P>

Except for Canadian product, all other products so marked, in compliance with this part, shall be entered into the United States, insofar as such entry is regulated under the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) Product which is inspected and rejected shall be marked “U.S. Refused Entry” as shown in § 327.26(c). Such marks shall be applied to the shipping container or the product itself if not in a container.</P>
            <P>(d) The inspection legend may be placed on containers of product before completion of official import inspection if the containers are being inspected by an import inspector who reports directly to an Import Field Office Supervisor; the product is not required to be held at the establishment pending the receipt of laboratory test results; and a written procedure for controlled stamping, submitted by the import establishment and approved by the Director, Import Inspection Division, is on file at the import inspection facility where the inspection is to be performed.</P>
            <P>(1) The written procedure for controlled pre-stamping should be in the form of a letter and shall include the following:</P>

            <P>(i) That stamping under this part will be limited to those lots of product which can be inspected on the day that <PRTPAGE P="300"/>certificates for the product are examined;</P>

            <P>(iv) That the establishment will maintain a daily stamping log containing the following information for each lot of product: the date of inspection, the country of origin, the foreign establishment number, the product name, the number of units, the shipping container marks, and the MP-410 number covering the product to be inspected. The daily stamping log must be retained by the establishment in accordance with the requirements of § 320.3.</P>
            <P>(2) An establishment's controlled pre-stamping privilege may be cancelled orally or in writing by the inspector who is supervising its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the establishment has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons therefor shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose controlled pre-stamping privilege has been cancelled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the controlled pre-stamping privilege was wrongfully cancelled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. The cancellation of the controlled pre-stamping privilege will be in effect until there is a final determination of the proceeding.</P>

            <P>(a)(1) Program inspectors shall report their findings as to any product which has been inspected in accordance with this part, to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry where the same is offered for clearance through Customs inspection.</P>
            <P>(2) When product has been identified as “U.S. refused entry, ” the inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and immediate exportation, or to an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) No lot of product which has been refused entry may be subdivided during disposition pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that removal and destruction of any damaged or otherwise unsound product from a lot destined for reexportation is permitted under supervision of USDA prior to exportation. Additionally, such refused entry lot may not be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the product came into the United States, without the expressed consent of the Administrator based on full information concerning the product's disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “lot” shall refer to that product indentified on MP Form 410 in the original request for inspection for importation pursuant to § 327.5.</P>
            <P>(4) Product which has been refused entry solely because of misbranding, in lieu of exportation or destruction pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may be brought into compliance with the requirements of this part, under supervision of an authorized representative of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(5) The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for “refused entry” product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.</P>
            <P>(6) If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Department will take such action as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expense in the appropriate legal forum.</P>
            <P>(7) No product which has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in accordance with section 402 of the Act and seizure and condemnation in accordance with section 403 of the Act.</P>

            <P>(b) Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to the Director <PRTPAGE P="302"/>any product which has been delivered to consignee under § 327.7 and subsequently designated “U.S. Refused Entry” or found in any respect not to comply with the requirements in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) All charges for storage, cartage, and labor with respect to any product which was imported contrary to the Act shall be paid by the owner or consignee, and in default of such payment shall constitute a lien against such product and any other product thereafter imported by or for such owner or consignee.</P>

            <P>(5) The <E T="03">Absolute Minimum PFF Requirement</E> is that no laboratory result <PRTPAGE P="305"/>of an individual sample for PFF content be below the applicable minimum requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter by 2.3 or more percentage points for a Group I or II product or 2.7 or more percentage points for a Group III or IV product.</P>
            <P>(6) A <E T="03">PFF Standardized Arithmetic Average of the Country's Products</E> is the arithmetic average of PFF Standardized Differences from either 36 or 100 consecutively sampled lots of product entering the United States from a given producing country.</P>
            <P>(7) A <E T="03">PFF Standardized Weighted Average of the Country's Products</E> is an estimate of the average of the PFF Standardized Differences from either 36 or 100 consecutively sampled lots, adjusted for the size of the lot, of different types of cured pork product entering the United States from a given producing country. A Standardized Weighted Average is computed by multiplying the PFF Standardized Difference calculated for each lot by the number of pounds of product in each lot, adding those results together, and dividing the sum by the total weight of product from all the lots making up the average.</P>
            <P>(8) The <E T="03">Appropriate Standard Deviation</E> is based on within lot variability. That assigned to Groups I and II = 0.75 percent PFF and that assigned to Groups III and IV = 0.91 percent PFF.</P>
            <P>(9) A <E T="03">Lot</E> is all product of one type from one establishment presented by an importer as the unit for inspection at the Port of Entry.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Normal monitoring procedures.</E> Except for product imported from Canada, the Department shall collect sample(s) of cured pork product on a random basis from lots offered for entry at the Port of Entry and, after analyzing the sample for fat and indigenous protein content, calculate the PFF percentage. The product shall not be held pending laboratory results during the monitoring phase. The PFF percentage for each sample shall be considered along with the cumulative results of prior samples to assess the effectiveness of a country's overall compliance program and to determine the course of action for subsequent lots of product.</P>
            <P>(1) Factors determining whether a country's inspection system is functioning adequately:</P>
            <P>(i) The PFF percentage for each sample must not be below the minimum PFF requirement by 2.3 percentage points for cured pork products in Groups I and II or 2.7 percentage points for cured pork products in Groups III and IV.</P>
            <P>(ii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic and Weighted, for the last 100 consecutive lots of all cured pork products from the country must be equal to or greater than zero. The count for the 100 consecutive lots starts with the lots arriving from that country after April 15, 1985.</P>
            <P>(iii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic and Weighted, for the last 36 consecutive lots of all cured pork products from the country must be above the lowest 5 percent of the Normal distribution. This minimum value is minus 0.28 (−0.28) for the Arithmetic Average and depends on the production volume for the Weighted Average.</P>
            <P>(2) Actions when calculations indicate that processing procedures in a country are out-of-compliance:</P>
            <P>(i) If the PFF level of a sample taken during normal monitoring procedures is found to be as low as the Absolute Minimum PFF Requirement, the country of origin shall be notified; the lot involved shall be retained if still available in an official establishment or subject to detention or other actions pursuant to the Act; and all subsequently presented lots of that cured pork product from the same foreign establishment shall be held under retention until the provisions of paragraph (c) are satisfied.</P>

            <P>(ii) If either of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic or Weighted, for the last 100 consecutive lots falls below zero or either of the PFF Standardized Averages for the last 36 consecutive lots falls below the upper 95 percent of the Normal distribution, all available cured pork product from the foreign country shall be subject to administrative retention and all subsequently presented lots of cured pork product from the foreign country shall be held under retention until the provisions of paragraph (c) are satisfied. The country of <PRTPAGE P="306"/>origin shall be notified, and shall be subject to other actions pursuant to the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Retention.</E> When lots of cured pork product are under retention they shall be refused entry and reexported in accordance with § 327.13 of this subchapter unless they can be released in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1), establishments may be returned to normal monitoring procedures in accordance with paragraph (c)(2), and countries may be returned to normal monitoring procedures in accordance with paragraph (c)(3).</P>
            <P>(1) If a lot is subject to retention procedures under this section, the Department shall collect five randomly selected sample units from each lot and determine the PFF of each sample unit. The lot may be released into commerce if:</P>
            <P>(i) The average PFF percentage of the five randomly selected sample units is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage required by § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter, or</P>
            <P>(ii) The product is relabeled under the supervision of a program employee so that it conforms to the provisions of § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(2) If product from a foreign establishment is subject to retention procedures under this section, the foreign establishment may be returned to normal monitoring procedures when:</P>
            <P>(i) Ten consecutively presented lots of that cured pork product from that establishment have been sampled as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the average of each set of five sample units representing each lot have been found to be equal to or greater than the required minimum PFF percentage; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The PFF percentage of each sample unit (50 in all) is above the Absolute Minimum PFF Percentage.</P>
            <P>(3) If a country is subject to retention procedures under this section, the country shall be returned to normal monitoring procedures when:</P>
            <P>(i) Twenty-five consecutively presented lots of cured pork product have been sampled as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the average of each set of five sample units representing each lot have been found to be equal to or greater than the required minimum PFF percentage; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The PFF percentage of each sample unit (125 in all) is above the Absolute Minimum PFF Percentage; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages for 36 consecutive lots are in the required percentage of the Normal distribution; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages for 100 consecutive lots are zero or higher.</P>
            <P>(4) The sample units collected under retention procedures as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will not be included in the PFF standardized averages for 36 and 100 consecutive lots.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Adulterated and Misbranded Products.</E> Products not meeting specified PFF requirements, determined according to procedures set forth in this section, may be deemed adulterated under section 1(m)(8) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(m)(8)) and misbranded under section 1(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)).</P>
            <P>(e) Activities requiring additional inspectional supervision, such as relabeling, shall be at the importer's expense. In addition, if the importer wishes, he or she may have samples analyzed at an accredited laboratory.</P>

            <SUBJECT>States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act; application of regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The provisions of the regulations in this subchapter apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in § 331.2 under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)</P>
            <P>(a) Each establishment located in such a designated State shall be granted inspection required under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.</P>
            <P>(b) Section 305.2 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter, except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of this subchapter. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations in this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(c) Sections 416.2(c), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this chapter shall apply to such establishments.</P>
            <P>(d) Section 314.2 of this subchapter shall apply to such establishments, except that a separate room or compartment need not be provided for inedible products if they can be handled so that they do not create insanitary conditions in any room or compartment used for edible products or otherwise render any edible products adulterated and do not interfere with the conduct of inspection. For example, intestines, paunch contents, feet, and hides might be accumulated on the kill floor in clean, watertight drums with close fitting covers if there is sufficient space to store them out of the way until the close of the day's operation.</P>
            <P>(e) Sections 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter apply to such establishments, except as provided in this paragraph (e).</P>
            <P>(1) The operator of each such establishment will, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use, (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor of the circuit in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under §§ 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 1(n) of the Act.</P>

            <P>(2) The circuit supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the Washington, DC, office of the Labeling and Packaging Staff and will retain one copy in <PRTPAGE P="313"/>a temporary approval file for the establishment.</P>
            <P>(3) The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection, all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by §§ 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, or their use must be discontinued.</P>
            <P>(4) The circuit supervisor will also review all shipping containers to insure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of self-destructive pressure sensitive tape or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of this subchapter must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.</P>
            <P>(f) Sections 320.1, 320.2, 320.3, 320.4, 320.5, 325.20, and 325.21 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 301(c) only if the State is also designated under section 205 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in § 331.6.</P>
            <P>(g) Section 321.1(a) of this subchapter will not apply to States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(h) Parts 322 and 327 and § 325.3 of this subchapter relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.</P>
            <P>(i) Part 325 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter and to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section.</P>
            <P>(j) Sections 325.4, 325.15, and 325.1(b) of this subchapter will not apply to require a certificate, or evidence thereof, for the distribution solely within any designated State of products that are U.S. inspected and passed and so marked.</P>

For a period of 90 days from the effective date of such designation, products which were prepared and inspected and passed under the supervision of a responsible State or local inspection agency can be distributed solely within the State, provided they are not adulterated or misbranded, except that the official inspection legend is not required. Within the 90-day period, products that have been inspected by the State or local inspection agency may be further prepared and otherwise handled in official establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter or at establishments exempted from the requirements of such inspection under § 303.1 of this subchapter, and may be distributed as provided in this section but otherwise shall be handled in accordance with § 305.4 of this subchapter. Such products shall not bear any [Federal] official inspection legends.

            <P>(a) An establishment preparing products solely for distribution within any State shall be designated as one producing adulterated products which would clearly endanger the public health, if:</P>
            <P>(1) Any meat or meat food product prepared at the establishment is adulterated in any of the following respects:</P>
            <P>(i) It bears or contains a pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive, that is “unsafe” within the meaning of sections 408, 409, or 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or was intentionally subjected to radiation in a manner not permitted under section 409 of said Act; or if it bears or contains any other added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health or make it unfit for human food; or</P>
            <P>(ii) It consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, or unwholesome or otherwise unfit for human food (for example, it was prepared from meat or other ingredients exhibiting spoilage characteristics; or it is, or was prepared from, a carcass affected with a disease transmissible to humans and its condemnation would be required under part 309 or 310 of the Federal Meat Inspection regulations (9 CFR parts 309, 310) at federally inspected establishments; or</P>
            <P>(iii) It has been prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health (for example if insects or vermin are not effectively controlled at the establishments, or insanitary water is used in preparing meat or meat food products for human food); or</P>
            <P>(iv) It is, in whole or in part, the product of an animal that died otherwise than by slaughter; or</P>
            <P>(v) Its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; and</P>
            <P>(2) Such adulterated articles are intended to be or are distributed from the establishment while capable of use as human food.</P>
            <P>(b) When any such establishment is identified by a Program Inspector as one producing adulterated product, which would clearly endanger public health under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the following procedure will be followed:</P>
            <P>(1) The Program Inspector will informally advise the operator of the establishment concerning the deficiencies found by him and report his findings to the appropriate Regional Director for the Program. When it is determined by the Regional Director that any establishment preparing products solely for distribution within any State is producing adulterated products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health, written notification thereof will be issued to the appropriate State officials, including the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee, for effective action under State or local law to prevent such endangering of the public health. Such written notification shall clearly specify the deficiencies deemed to result in the production of adulterated products and shall specify a reasonable time for such action under State or local law.</P>
            <P>(2) If effective action is not taken under State or local law within the specified time, written notification shall be issued by the Regional Director to the operator of the establishment, specifying the deficiencies involved and allowing him ten days to present his views or make the necessary corrections, and notifying him that failure to correct such deficiencies may result in designation of the establishment and operator thereof as subject to the provisions of titles I and IV of the Act as though engaged in commerce.</P>

            <P>(3) Thereafter the Program Inspector shall survey the establishment and designate it if he determines, in consultation with the Regional Director, that it is producing adulterated products, which would clearly endanger the public health, and formal notice of such <PRTPAGE P="315"/>designation will be issued to the operator of the establishment by the Regional Director.</P>

            <P>(c) Products on hand at the time of designation of an establishment under this section are subject to detention, seizure and condemnation in accordance with part 329 of this subchapter: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That products that have been federally inspected and so identified and that have not been further prepared at any nonfederally inspected establishment may be released for distribution if the products appear to be not adulterated or misbranded at the time of such release.</P>
            <P>(d) No establishment designated under this section can lawfully prepare any products unless it first obtains inspection or qualifies for exemption under § 303.1 of this subchapter. All of the provisions of the regulations shall apply to establishments designated under this section, except that the exceptions provided for in § 331.3 of this part shall apply to such establishments.</P>

            <P>(4) Part-time and temporary employees are counted the same as full-time employees.</P>
            <P>(5) If the establishment has not been in business for 12 months, the average number of employees is calculated for each of the pay periods in which the establishment has been in business.</P>
            <P>(6) Volunteers who receive no compensation are not considered employees unless their duties involve handling the meat or meat food products prepared by the establishment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>State request for cooperative agreement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) State participation in a cooperative interstate shipment program under this part is limited to States that have implemented cooperative State meat inspection programs.</P>
            <P>(b) To request an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program under this part, a State must submit a written request to the Administrator through the FSIS District Office for the FSIS District in which the State is located. In the request the State must:</P>
            <P>(1) Identify establishments in the State that have requested to be selected for the program that the State recommends for initial selection into the program, if any;</P>
            <P>(2) Demonstrate that the State is able to provide the necessary inspection services to selected establishments in the State and conduct any related activities that would be required under a cooperative interstate shipment program established under this part; and</P>
            <P>(3) Agree that, if the State enters into an agreement with FSIS for a cooperative interstate shipment program, the State will:</P>
            <P>(i) Provide FSIS with access to the results of all laboratory analyses conducted on product samples from selected establishments in the State;</P>
            <P>(ii) Notify the selected establishment coordinator for the State of the results of any laboratory analyses that indicate that a product prepared in a selected establishment may be adulterated or may otherwise present a food safety concern; and</P>
            <P>(iii) When necessary, cooperate with FSIS to transition selected establishments in the State that have been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program to become official establishments.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Administrator determines that a State that has submitted a request to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program qualifies to enter into a cooperative agreement for such a program, the Administrator and the State will sign a cooperative agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions under which each party will cooperate to provide inspection services to selected establishments located in the State.</P>
            <P>(d) After the Administrator and a State have signed an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will:</P>
            <P>(1) Appoint an FSIS employee as the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Establishment selection; official number for selected establishments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An establishment operating under a cooperative State meat inspection program will qualify for selection into a cooperative interstate shipment program if the establishment:</P>
            <P>(1) Has submitted a request to the State to be selected for the program;</P>
            <P>(2) Has the appropriate number of employees under § 332.3(a) of this part;</P>

            <P>(5) Is in compliance with all requirements under the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) To participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program, an establishment that meets the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section must be selected by the Administrator, in coordination with the State where the establishment is located.</P>

            <P>(c) If an establishment is selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the State is to assign the establishment an official number that reflects the establishment's participation in the cooperative <PRTPAGE P="319"/>interstate shipment program and advise the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State of the official number assigned to each selected establishment in the State. The official number assigned to every selected establishment must contain a suffix, e.g., “SE,” that identifies the establishment as a selected establishment and that identifies the State, e.g., “SETX,” for “selected establishment Texas.”</P>
            <P>(d) Failure of the State to comply with paragraph (c) of this section will disqualify the State from participation in the cooperative interstate shipment program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Federal oversight of a cooperative interstate shipment program.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The FSIS selected establishment coordinator for a State that has entered into an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program will visit each selected establishment in the State on a regular basis to verify that the establishment is operating in a manner that is consistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The frequency with which the SEC will visit selected establishments under the SEC's jurisdiction will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the operations conducted at the selected establishment, the establishment's schedule of operations, and the establishment's performance under the cooperative interstate shipment program. If necessary, the selected establishment coordinator, in consultation with the District Manager that covers the State, may designate qualified FSIS personnel to visit a selected establishment on behalf of the selected establishment coordinator.</P>
            <P>(b) The selected establishment coordinator, in coordination with the State, will verify that selected establishments in the State are receiving the necessary inspection services from designated personnel, and that these establishments are eligible, and remain eligible, to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program. The selected establishment coordinator's verification activities may include:</P>
            <P>(1) Verifying that each selected establishment employs, and continues to employ, 25 or fewer employees, on average, as required under § 332.3(a) of this part, unless the establishment is transitioning to become an official establishment;</P>
            <P>(2) Verifying that the designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter;</P>
            <P>(3) Verifying that that the State staffing levels for each selected establishments are appropriate to carry out the required inspection activities; and</P>
            <P>(4) Assessing each selected establishment's compliance with the Act and implementing regulations under this chapter.</P>

            <P>(c) If the selected establishment coordinator determines that designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in the State in a manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter, <PRTPAGE P="320"/>the Administrator will provide an opportunity for the State to develop and implement a corrective action plan to address inspection deficiencies identified by the selected establishment coordinator. If the State fails to develop a corrective action plan, or the selected establishment coordinator for the State determines that the corrective action plan is inadequate, the Administrator will terminate the agreement for the cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 321.3(d) of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Quarterly reports.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The selected establishment coordinator will prepare a report on a quarterly basis that describes the status of each selected establishment under his or her jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(b) The quarterly report required in paragraph (a) of this section will:</P>
            <P>(1) Include the selected establishment coordinator's assessment of the performance of the designated personnel in conducting inspection activities at selected establishments and</P>
            <P>(2) Identify those selected establishments that the selected establishment coordinator has verified are in compliance with the Act and implementing regulations in this chapter, those that have been deselected under § 332.10 of this part, and those that are transitioning to become official establishments under § 332.11 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) The selected establishment coordinator is to submit the quarterly report to the Administrator through the District Manager for the State where the selected establishments identified in the report are located.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Enforcement authority.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To facilitate oversight and enforcement of this part, selected establishments operating under a cooperative interstate shipment program must, upon request, give the FSIS selected establishment coordinator or other FSIS officials access to all establishment records required under the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The Administrator may deselect any selected establishment that refuses to comply with this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(b) Selected establishment coordinators may initiate any appropriate enforcement action provided for in part 500 of this chapter if they determine that a selected establishment under their jurisdiction is operating in a manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. Selected establishments participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program are subject to the notification and appeal procedures set out in part 500 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) If inspection at a selected establishment is suspended for any of the reasons specified in § 500.3 or § 500.4 of this chapter, FSIS will:</P>
            <P>(1) Provide an opportunity for the establishment to implement corrective actions and remain in the cooperative interstate shipment program, or</P>
            <P>(2) Move to deselect the establishment as provided in § 332.10 of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) The decision to deselect a selected establishment under a suspension will be made on a case-by-case basis. In making this decision, FSIS, in consultation with the State where the selected establishment is located, will consider, among other factors:</P>
            <P>(1) The non-compliance that led to the suspension;</P>
            <P>(2) The selected establishment's compliance history; and</P>
            <P>(3) The corrective actions proposed by the selected establishment.</P>

Except that an establishment that was deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program because it is located in a State whose agreement for such a program was terminated may either transition to become an official establishment or transition to become a State-inspected establishment under the cooperative State meat inspection program.</P>
            <P>(b) An establishment that has been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program and successfully transitioned to become an official establishment may withdraw from the Federal inspection program and resume operations under the cooperative State meat inspection program after operating as an official establishment in full compliance with the Act for a year.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, before any violation of the Federal Meat Inspection Act is reported to the Department of Justice by the Secretary for criminal prosecution the Secretary must give reasonable notice to the suspected violator that the Secretary intends to report the violation for prosecution and give the suspected violator an opportunity to present the violator's views to the Secretary with respect to such proceeding.</P>
              <P>(1) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Secretary has any reason to believe that providing such notice and opportunity could result in the alteration or destruction of evidence, or where disclosure could result in injury to persons or property.</P>
              <P>(2) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Secretary has any reason to believe that providing such notice and opportunity could result in flight of a suspected violator to avoid prosecution.</P>

              <P>(3) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Secretary has any reason to believe that providing such notice and opportunity could result in <PRTPAGE P="322"/>compromising special investigative techniques, such as undercover or other covert operations.</P>
              <P>(4) Notice and opportunity need not be provided when the impending criminal referral involves suspicion of bribery and related offenses, or clandestine slaughtering and/or processing operations.</P>
              <P>(5) Notice and opportunity need not be provided when the impending referral is part of an investigation involving non-Act violations, and the Act and non-Act violations are jointly referred for prosecution.</P>
              <P>(b) A notice of opportunity to present views will be sent by registered or certified mail, summarize the violations that constitute the basis of the contemplated prosecution, and describe the procedures for presentation of views. Any information given by a respondent, orally or in writing, shall become part of the Department's official record concerning the matter. The Department is under no obligation to disclose evidence to the suspected violator.</P>

            <P>Upon application in accordance with § 350.5 the following types of service may be furnished under the regulations in this part:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification service.</E> (1) Meat or other product that is federally inspected and passed at an official establishment, or upon importation, under the meat inspection laws, is officially marked to identify it as federally inspected and passed. In order to facilitate the division of such meat or other product into smaller portions or its combination into larger units and still maintain its identity as product which has been federally inspected and passed and so marked, inspectors may supervise the handling of the product and mark such portions or units with the marks of Federal inspection when they determine that the identity has been maintained.</P>
            <P>(2) At the time service is furnished product must be sound, wholesome and fit for human food. The service will be available only on premises other than those of an official establishment. The sanitation of the plant or area where service is furnished must comply with applicable provisions of part 416, §§ 416.1 through 416.6 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) The mark of inspection shall be applied only under the immediate supervision of an inspector.</P>
            <P>(4) The service will be available for products moved in tank cars and tank trucks from an official establishment or from a location operating under this service only if such tank cars or tank trucks bear a label before leaving such official establishment or such other location, in accordance with 9 CFR §§ 316.14 and 317.2.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification service.</E> At the request of a purchaser, supplier, exporter, or others, inspectors may make certification regarding livestock products for human food purposes (including casings), to be exported, as meeting conditions or standards that are not imposed or are in addition to those imposed by the regulations in parts 301 through 331 of this chapter and the laws under which such regulations were issued.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Food inspection service.</E> An inspection and certification service for wholesomeness relating to the manufacture of a food article may be furnished upon application.

            <P>(b) Service under the regulations in this part may also be denied to any person by the Secretary for such period as he may deem proper, if it is determined, after opportunity for hearing before a proper official in the Department, that such person has been responsible for any willful misrepresentation to the Department concerning any meat or other product for which service has been requested under the regulations, in this part, or that such person has been responsible for the use without authority, or the imitation, of any marks or certificates of Federal meat inspection on or with respect to any meat or other product, or has otherwise been responsible for any fraudulent or deceptive practice with respect to such service, or that such person has interfered with or obstructed any inspector in the performance of his duties under the regulations in this part, or attempted to do so. When the Administrator determines that the public interest so requires, he may deny or withdraw service provided for in this part, without a hearing, pending final determination of the matter. The applicant or recipient of service involved shall be notified of the Administrator's decision to deny or suspend service and the reasons therefor, in writing, in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), or orally. The Administrator's decision to deny or suspend the service shall be effective upon such oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the applicant or recipient of service. If such notification is oral, the Administrator shall confirm such decision and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the applicant or recipient of service, in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)). In other cases prior to the institution of proceedings for denial of service under this paragraph, the facts or conduct which may warrant such action shall be called to the attention of the person involved, in writing, and he shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all applicable requirements.</P>

Notice of such rejection, denial, or withdrawal, and the reasons therefore, shall promptly be given to the person involved. The applicant or recipient shall be notified of such decision to reject an application or request for service or to deny or withdraw the benefits of the service, and the reasons therefor, in writing in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), or orally. Such decision shall be effective upon such oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the applicant or recipient. If such notification is oral, the person making such decision shall confirm such decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the applicant or recipient in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)).</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (1) An application or request for service may be denied or benefits of the service may be withdrawn by the Secretary, as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, after notice and opportunity for hearing before a designated official of the Department. The Administrator may suspend service under this paragraph without hearing, pending final determination of the matter, when he determines that the public health, interest or safety so requires. The applicant or recipient shall be notified of the Administrator's decision to suspend service, and the reasons therefor, in writing or orally. The Administrator's decision to suspend service under this part shall be effective upon such an oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the applicant or recipient. If such notification is oral, the Administrator shall confirm such decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the applicant or recipient in the manner prescribed in 1.147(b) of Departmental rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)).</P>
              <P>(2) The written notification specified in paragraph (c) of this section, which shall constitute the complaint in the proceeding, shall briefly set forth the reason for the denial or withdrawal of service, including allegations of fact which constitute a basis for the action. After the complaint is served upon the respondent, as provided in § 1.147(b) of Departmental rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), the proceeding shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with rules of practice which shall be adopted for the proceeding.</P>

If the establishment complies with all these requirements for ante-mortem inspection, FSIS will conduct ante-mortem inspection at that establishment in accordance with § 352.10, and all other provisions in part 309 of this subchapter that pertain to horses will apply. FSIS may deny or withdraw ante-mortem inspection services at official establishments that slaughter horses for any applicable reason under § 352.6. Official marks and devices to identify inspected and passed horse carcasses and parts of carcasses, or horse meat food products shall be those in § 312.3 of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Wording and form of inspection mark.</E> Except as otherwise authorized, the inspection mark permitted to be used with respect to inspected and certified edible products shall include wording as follows: “Inspected for Wholesomeness by U.S. Department of Agriculture.” This wording shall be contained within a circle in the form and arrangement shown in § 354.65. The appropriate plant number of the official plant shall be included in the circle unless it appears elsewhere on the packaging material. The Administrator may approve the use of abbreviations of such inspection mark, and such approved abbreviations shall have the same force and effect as the inspection mark. The inspection mark or approved abbreviation thereof, as the case may be, may be applied to the inspected and certified edible product or to the packaging material of such product. When the inspection mark, or the approved abbreviation thereof, is used on packaging material, it shall be printed on such material or on a label to be affixed to the packaging material and the name of the packer or distributor of such product shall be printed on the packaging material or label, as the case may be, except that on shipping containers and containers for institutional packs, the inspection marks may be stenciled on the container and, when the inspection mark is so stenciled, the name and address of the packer or distributor may be applied by the use of a stencil or a rubber stamp. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the name and address of the packer or distributor, if appropriately shown elsewhere on the packaging material, may be omitted from insert labels which bear an official identification if the applicable plant number is shown.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Wording on labels.</E> Each trade label to be approved for use pursuant to §§ 354.60 to 354.64 with respect to any inspected and certified edible product shall bear the true name of the edible product, the name and address of the packer or distributor thereof, and in prominent letters and figures of uniform size, the inspection mark, as aforesaid, and the label shall also bear, in such manner as may be prescribed or approved by the Administrator, the plant number, if any, of the official plant in which such product was inspected and certified. The class of the rabbits shall be shown on the label. The appropriate designation “young”, “mature”, or “old” may be used as a prefix to the word “rabbit” in lieu of the class name.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Labels in foreign languages.</E> Any trade label to be affixed to a container of any edible products for foreign commerce may be printed in a foreign language. However, the inspection mark shall appear on the label in English, but, in addition, may be literally translated into such foreign language. Each such trade label which is to be printed in a foreign language must be approved pursuant to §§ 354.60 to 354.64.<PRTPAGE P="350"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unauthorized use or disposition of approved labels.</E> (1) Labels approved for use pursuant to §§ 354.60 to 354.64 shall be used only for the purpose for which approved and shall not otherwise be disposed of from the plant for which approved except with written approval of the Administrator. Any unauthorized use or disposition of approved labels or labels bearing official identification may result in cancellation of the approval and denial of the use of labels bearing official identification or denial of the benefits of the Act pursuant to the provisions of § 354.60.</P>
              <P>(2) The use of simulations or imitations of any official identification by any person is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Rescindment of approved labels.</E> Once a year, or more often if requested, each applicant shall submit to the Administrator a list in triplicate of approved labels that have become obsolete, accompanied with a statement that such approvals are no longer desired. The approvals shall be identified by the date of approval and the name of product or other designation showing the class of material.</P>

Immediately after the slaughter of any rabbit so infected, the infected premises and implements used shall be thoroughly sanitized. The part or parts of any carcass coming into contact with the carcass or any part of the carcass of any rabbit covered by this section other than those affected with acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges, shall be condemned.</P>
              <P>(g) Carcasses showing any degree of icterus with a parenchymatous degeneration of organs, the result of infection or intoxication, and those which, as a result of a pathological condition, show an intense yellow or greenish-yellow discoloration without evidence of infection or intoxication shall be condemned.</P>
              <P>(h) Carcasses of rabbits affected with mange or scab in advanced stages, or showing emaciation or extension of the inflammation to the flesh, shall be condemned.

              <P>(i) In the disposal of carcasses and parts of carcasses showing evidence of infestation with parasites not transmissible to man, the following general rules shall govern: If the lesions are localized in such manner and are of such character that the parasites and the lesions caused by them may be radically removed, the non-affected portion of the carcass, or part of the carcass, may be certified for food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions. Where a part of a carcass shows <PRTPAGE P="355"/>numerous lesions caused by parasites, or the character of the infestation is such that complete extirpation of the parasites and lesions is difficult and uncertainly accomplished, or if the parasitic infestation or invasion renders the organ or part in any way unfit for food, the affected organ or part shall be condemned. Where parasites are found to be distributed in a carcass in such a manner or to be of such a character that their removal and the removal of the lesions caused by them are impracticable, no part of the carcass shall be certified for food and the entire carcass shall be condemned. Carcasses infested with a hydatid cyst or cysts (Echinococcus granulosis), transmissible to dogs and from dogs to man, shall in all cases be condemned regardless of the degree of infestation.</P>
              <P>(j) Carcasses of rabbits showing such degree of emaciation or anemic condition as would render the meat unwholesome, and carcasses which show a slimy degeneration of the fat or a serious infiltration of the muscles shall be condemned.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Canning with heat processing and hermetically sealed containers; closures; code marking; heat processing; incubation.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Containers shall be cleaned thoroughly immediately before filling, and <PRTPAGE P="370"/>precaution must be taken to avoid soiling the inner surfaces subsequently.</P>
              <P>(b) The inside surfaces of containers of metal, glass, or other material shall be washed by spraying in an inverted position with running water at a temperature of at least 180 °F. The container washing equipment shall be provided with a thermometer to register the temperature of the water used for cleaning the containers.</P>
              <P>(c) Perfect closure is required for hermetically sealed containers. Heat processing shall follow promptly after closing.</P>
              <P>(d) Careful inspection shall be made of the containers by competent plant employees immediately after closing, and containers which are defectively filled or defectively closed, or which show inadequate vacuum, shall not be further processed until the defect has been corrected. The containers shall again be inspected by plant employees when they have cooled sufficiently for handling after processing by heating. The contents of defective containers shall be condemned unless correction of the defect is accomplished within six hours following the sealing of the containers or completion of the heat processing, as the case may be, except that (1) if the defective condition is discovered during an afternoon run the cans of product may be held in coolers at a temperature not exceeding 38 °F. under conditions that will promptly and effectively chill them until the following day when the defect may be corrected; and (2) short vacuum or overstuffed cans of products which have not been handled in accordance with the above may be incubated as provided in paragraph (i) of this section in the inspected plant under Program supervision, after which the cans shall be opened and the sound products passed.</P>
              <P>(e) Canned products shall not be passed unless, after cooling to atmospheric temperature, they show the external characteristic of sound cans; that is, the cans shall not be overfilled, the ends of the cans shall be concave, there shall be no bulging of the cans, the sides and ends of the cans shall conform to the products, and there shall be no slack or loose tin in the cans.</P>
              <P>(f) All canned products shall be plainly and permanently marked on the containers by code or otherwise with the identity of the contents and date of canning. The code used and its meaning shall be on record in the office of the circuit supervisor before use.</P>
              <P>(g) The canned products must be processed at such temperature and for such period of time as will assure keeping without refrigeration under usual conditions of storage and transportation as evidenced by the incubation test.</P>
              <P>(h) Lots of canned products shall be identified during their handling preparatory to and during heat processing by tagging the baskets or cages in which the cans are being conveyed, with a tag which will change color on going through the heat processing or by other effective means so as to insure the proper channeling of the products for effective heat processing after closing the cans.</P>

              <P>(i) Facilities shall be provided to incubate at least representative samples of the fully processed canned products. The incubation shall consist of holding the canned products for at least 10 days at about 98 °F. The extent to which incubation tests shall be required by inspectors depends on conditions such as the record of the inspected plant in conducting canning operations, the extent to which the plant furnishes competent supervision and inspection in connection with the canning operations, the character of the equipment used, and the degree to which such equipment is maintained at maximum efficiency. Such factors shall be considered by the circuit supervisor in determining the extent of incubation testing at a particular plant. In the event of failure by an inspected plant to provide suitable facilities for incubation of test samples, the circuit supervisor may require holding of the entire lot under such conditions and for such period of time as may, in his discretion, be necessary to establish the stability of the canned products. The circuit supervisor may permit lots of canned certified products to be shipped from the inspected plant prior to completion of sample incubation when he has no reason to suspect unsoundness in the particular lots, and under circumstances <PRTPAGE P="371"/>which will assure the return of the products to the plant for inspection should such action be indicated by the incubation results.</P>

The Administrator may reject an application or request for service or deny or withdraw service under this paragraph without hearing, pending final determination of the matter, when he determines that the public interest so requires. The operator or applicant of such plant shall be notified of the Administrator's decision to reject the application or request for service or to deny or withdraw such service, and the reasons therefor, in writing, in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), or orally. The Administrator's decision to reject an application or request for service or to deny or withdraw the benefits of service under the Act shall be effective upon such oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator or applicant of such plant. If such notification is oral, the Administrator shall confirm such decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the operator or applicant of such plant in <PRTPAGE P="379"/>the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">For correctable cause</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basis for denial or withdrawal.</E> An application or request for service may be rejected, or the benefits of the service may be otherwise denied to, or withdrawn from, any person whose establishment does not meet the requirements as to premises, facilities, and equipment, and the operation thereof, prescribed in the regulations to prevent the distribution of adulterated poultry or poultry products, or who has not received approval of labeling and containers to be used at the establishment as required by the regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> An application or request for service may be rejected, or benefits of the service may be otherwise denied to or withdrawn by the Secretary, as provided by this paragraph, after notice and opportunity for hearing before a proper official of the Department. The Administrator may reject an application or request for service or deny or withdraw service under this paragraph without hearing, pending final determination of the matter, when he determines that the public interest so requires.

The Administrator's decision to reject an application or request for service or to deny or withdraw the benefits of service under the Act shall be effective upon such oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator or applicant of such plant.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">For miscellaneous reasons.</E> An application or a request for service may be rejected, or the benefits of the service may be otherwise denied to, or withdrawn from, any person, without a hearing, by the official in charge of the appropriate regional office, with the concurrence of the Regional Director (1) for administrative reasons such as the nonavailability of personnel to perform the service; (2) for the failure to pay for service; (3) in case the application or request relates to birds or products which are not eligible for service under this part 362; or (4) in case the person is a partnership, corporation, or other person from whom the benefits of the service are currently being withheld under paragraph (a) of this section. Notice of such rejection, denial, or withdrawal, and the reasons therefor, shall promptly be given to the person involved. The operator or applicant of such plant shall be notified of such decisions to reject an application or request for service or to deny or withdraw the benefits of the service, and the reasons therefor, in writing, in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), or orally. Such decision shall be effective upon such oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator or applicant of such plant. If such notification is oral, the person making such decision shall confirm such decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the operator or applicant of such plant in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)).</P>

              <P>(a) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator may in specific classes of cases waive for limited periods any provisions of the regulations in order to permit appropriate and necessary action in the event of a public health emergency or to permit experimentation so that new procedures, equipment, and processing techniques may be tested to facilitate definite improvements: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such <PRTPAGE P="389"/>waivers of the provisions of the regulations are not in conflict with the purposes or provisions of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) Pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Administrator believes that, in establishments processing poultry products at which inspection under the Act and regulations is required, the frequency with which and the manner in which poultry products made from poultry previously slaughtered and eviscerated in official establishments are reinspected by Inspection Service employees should be based on considerations relevant to effective regulation of poultry products and protection of the health and welfare of consumers. In order to test procedures for use in making such determinations and, in particular, for determining whether and, if so, to what extent the intensity of inspection coverage exceeds that which should be deemed necessary pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Administrator is initiating experimentation of a new system of inspection for reviewing the performance of establishments and for designing the supervision and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage. For the period of such experimentation, the Administrator shall identify establishments for review, and the frequency and the manner of inspection by Inspection Service employees shall be determined on the basis of the results of those reviews and be otherwise in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The determinations referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be made by the Inspection Service and shall reflect evaluations of the performance and the characteristics of such establishments.</P>
              <P>(1) In assessing the performance of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:</P>
              <P>(i) The history of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the person operating such establishment or by anyone responsibly connected with the business operating such establishment, as “responsibly connected” is defined in section 18(a) of the Act,</P>
              <P>(ii) The competence of the person operating such establishment, as indicated by:</P>
              <P>(A) Knowledge of appropriate manufacturing practices and applicable regulatory requirements,</P>
              <P>(B) Demonstrated ability to apply such knowledge in a timely and consistent manner, and</P>
              <P>(C) Commitment to correcting deficiencies noted by Inspection Service employees and otherwise assuring compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and</P>
              <P>(iii) The procedures used in such establishment to control the production process, environment, and resulting product in order to assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.</P>
              <P>(2) In assessing the characteristics of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:</P>
              <P>(i) The complexity of the processing operation(s) conducted at such establishment,</P>
              <P>(ii) The frequency with which each such operation is conducted at such establishment,</P>
              <P>(iii) The volume of product resulting from each such operation at such establishment,</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether and to what extent slaughter and evisceration operations also are conducted at such establishment,</P>
              <P>(v) What, if any, food products not regulated under this Act or the Federal Meat Inspection Act also are processed at such establishment, and</P>
              <P>(vi) The size of such establishment.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) For the period of experimentation described in paragraph (c) of this section, the frequency of inspection by Inspection Service employees of operations other than slaughter and evisceration may be reduced in an establishment in which the procedures referred to therein are being tested if and only if the evaluation of the performance of such establishment described in paragraph (d)(1) indicates that there are:</P>

              <P>(i) No instances, documented in records compiled no earlier than 10 years before, of substantial and recent noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements (taking into account both the nature and frequency of any such noncompliance), and<PRTPAGE P="390"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The competence and control procedures needed to assure and monitor compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The frequency of Federal inspection and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage in any establishment in which the frequency of Federal inspection is reduced shall be based on:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Refusal of inspection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any application for inspection in accordance with this part may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters of the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards. No grant of inspection can be issued after April 3, 1970 (the date of enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act), unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act on a request for certification within 1 year after receipt of such request. Further, upon receipt of an application for inspection and a certification as required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Administrator (as defined in § 381.1) is required by paragraph (2) of said subsection to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for proceedings in accordance with that paragraph. No grant of inspection can be made until the requirements of said paragraph (2) have been met.</P>
              <P>(2) However, certification under subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is not initially required in connection with an application for inspection granted after April 3, 1970, for facilities existing or under construction on April 3, 1970, although certification for such facilities is required to be obtained within the 3-year period immediately following April 3, 1970. Failure to obtain such certification or to meet the other requirements of subsection 21(b) prior to April 3, 1973, will result in the termination of inspection at such facilities on that date.</P>
              <P>(3) Further, any application for inspection pending on April 3, 1970, and granted within 1 year thereafter shall not require certification for 1 year following the grant of inspection but such grant of inspection shall terminate at the end of 1 year after its issuance unless prior thereto such certification has been obtained and the other requirements of subsection 21(b) are met.</P>

              <P>(4) In the case of any activity which will affect water quality but for which there are no applicable water quality standards, no certification is required prior to the grant of inspection but <PRTPAGE P="401"/>such grant will be conditioned upon a requirement of compliance with the purpose of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as provided in paragraph 21(b)(9) of said Act.</P>

              <P>(b) Before being granted Federal inspection, an establishment shall have conducted a hazard analysis and developed and validated a HACCP plan, in accordance with §§ 417.2 and 417.4 of this chapter. A conditional grant of inspection shall be issued for a period not to exceed 90 days, during which period the establishment must validate its HACCP plan.</P>
              <P>(c) Before producing new product for distribution in commerce, an establishment shall have conducted a hazard analysis and developed a HACCP plan applicable to that product in accordance with § 417.2 of this chapter.

              <P>(a) No operations requiring inspection shall be conducted except under the supervision of an Inspection Service employee. All eviscerating of poultry and further processing shall be done with reasonable speed, considering the official establishment's facilities.</P>

              <P>(b) A shift is a regularly scheduled operating period, exclusive of mealtime. One lunch period is the only official authorized interruption in the inspector's tour of duty once it begins. Lunch periods may be 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or in any case may not exceed one hour in duration. Once established, the lunch period must remain relatively constant as to time and duration. Lunch periods for inspectors shall <PRTPAGE P="408"/>not, except as provided herein, occur prior to 4 hours after the beginning of scheduled operations nor later than 5 hours after operations begin. In plants where a company rest break of not less than 30 minutes is regularly observed, approximately midpoint between start of work and the lunch period, and the inspector is allowed this time to meet his personal needs, the lunch period may be scheduled as long as 5<FR>1/2</FR> hours after the beginning of scheduled operations.</P>

              <P>(c) Official establishments, importers, and exporters shall be provided inspection service, without charge, up to 8 hours per shift during the basic workweek subject to the provisions of § 381.38: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any additional shifts meet requirements as determined by the Administrator or his designee. The basic workweek shall consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days within the administrative workweek Sunday through Saturday, except that, when possible, the Department shall schedule the basic workweek so as to consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday. The 8-hour day excludes the lunch period but shall include activities deemed necessary by the Agency to fully carry out an inspection program, including the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to put on required gear, pick up required forms and walk to a work station; and the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to return from a work station, drop off required forms, and remove required gear; and to conduct duties scheduled by FSIS, including administrative duties. The Department may depart from the basic workweek in those cases where maintaining such a schedule would seriously handicap the Department in carrying out its functions. These provisions are applicable to all official establishments except in certain cases as provided in § 381.145(h) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Each official establishment shall submit a work schedule to the area supervisor for approval. In consideration of whether the approval of an establishment work schedule shall be given, the area supervisor shall take in account the efficient and effective use of inspection personnel. The work schedule must specify the workweek, daily clock hours of operation, and lunch periods for all departments of the establishment requiring inspection.</P>

              <P>(2) Establishments shall maintain consistent work schedules. Any request by an establishment for a change in its work schedule involving changes in the workweek or an addition or elimination of shifts shall be submitted to the area supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the proposed change. Frequent requests for change shall not be approved: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> Minor deviations from a daily operating schedule may be approved by the inspector in charge if such request is received on the day preceding the day of change.</P>

              <P>(3) Requests for inspection service outside an approved work schedule shall be made as early in the day as possible for overtime work to be performed within that same workday; or made prior to the end of the day's operation when such a request will result in overtime service at the start of the following day: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That an inspector may be recalled to his assignment after the completion of his daily tour of duty under the provisions of § 381.39(b).</P>

The standards in 381.170(a) of this part specify which classes of birds constitute young chickens and squabs. Section 381.76(b) specifies when either the traditional inspection procedure or the modified traditional inspection procedure can or must be used.</P>

              <P>(a) The maximum inspection rates for one inspector New Turkey Inspection (NTI-1 and NTI-1 Modified) and two inspectors New Turkey Inspection (NTI-2 and NTI-2 Modified) are listed in the table below. The line speeds for NTI-1 and NTI-2 are for lines using standard 9-inch shackles on 12-inch centers with birds hung on every shackle and opened with J-type or Bar-type opening cuts. The line speeds for NTI-1 Modified and NTI-2 Modified are for Bar-type cut turkey lines using a shackle with a 4-inch by 4-inch selector (or kickout), a 45 degree bend of the lower 2 inches, an extended central loop portion of the shackle that lowers the abdominal cavity opening of the carcasses to an angle of 30 degrees from the vertical in direct alignment with the inspector's view, and a width of 10.5 inches. Maximum rates for those establishments having varying configurations will be established by the Administrator but will not exceed those in the table. Neither the rates in the table nor those established for establishments with varying configurations shall be exceeded under any circumstances.</P>

              <P>(b) There are two categories of turkeys for determining inspection rates, “light turkeys” and “heavy turkeys”. Light turkeys are all turkeys weighing <PRTPAGE P="413"/>less than 16 pounds. Heavy turkeys are all turkeys weighing 16 pounds or more. The weights refer to the bird at the point of post-mortem inspection, with blood, feathers and feet removed.</P>
              <P>(c) The inspector in charge may reduce inspection line rates when in his/her judgment the prescribed inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed within the time available because the health conditions of a particular flock or other factors, including the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection and the level of contamination among the birds on the line, dictate a need for a more extended inspection.</P>

              <P>When any poultry at an official establishment is suspected of having been treated with or exposed to any substance that may impart a biological residue that would make their edible tissues adulterated, they shall, at the option of the operator of the establishment, be processed at the establishment and the carcasses and all parts thereof retained under U.S. Retained tags, pending final disposition in accordance with § 381.80, of this part, and other provisions in subpart K; or they shall be slaughtered at the establishment and buried or incinerated in a manner satisfactory to the inspector. Alternatively, such poultry may be returned to the grower, if further holding is likely to result in their not being adulterated by reason of any residue. The Inspection Service will notify the other Federal and State agencies concerned of such action. To aid in determining the amount of residue present in the poultry, officials of the Inspection Service may permit the slaughter of any such poultry for the purpose of collecting tissues for analysis of the residue. Such analysis may include the use of inplant screening procedures designed to detect the presence of antimicrobial residues in any species of poultry.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Post-mortem inspection under Traditional Inspection, the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS), the New Line Speed (NELS) Inspection System, the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS), the New Turkey Inspection System (NTI), and Ratite Inspection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A post-mortem inspection shall be made on a bird-by-bird basis on all poultry eviscerated in every official establishment. Each carcass, or all parts comprising such carcass, must be examined by an inspector, except for parts that are not needed for inspection purposes and are not intended for human food and are condemned. Each carcass eviscerated shall be prepared as ready-to-cook poultry.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) There are six systems of post-mortem inspection: the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS), which may be used for young chickens and turkeys; the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS) and the New Line Speed Inspection System (NELS), both of which may be used only for broilers and cornish game hens; the New Turkey Inspection (NTI) System, which may be used only for turkeys; Traditional Inspection, which may be used for all poultry, except for ratites; and Ratite Inspection.</P>
              <P>(i) The SIS shall be used only for broilers and cornish game hens if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The Administrator determines that SIS will increase inspector efficiency; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The operator requests SIS and the Administrator determines that the system will result in no loss of inspection efficiency.</P>
              <P>(ii) The NELS Inspection System shall be used only for broilers and cornish game hens if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The operator requests the NELS Inspection System, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The Administrator determines that the establishment has the intent and capability to operate at line speeds greater than 70 birds per minute, and meets all the facility requirements in § 381.36(d).</P>
              <P>(iii) The NTI System shall be used only for turkeys if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The operator requests it, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The Administrator determines that the establishment meets all the facility requirements in § 381.36(e).</P>
              <P>(iv) The NPIS may be used for young chickens and turkeys if the official establishment requests to use it and meets or agrees to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section and the Administrator approves the establishment's request. The Administrator may permit establishments that slaughter classes of poultry other than young chickens and turkeys to operate under the New Poultry Inspection System under a waiver from the provisions of the regulations as provided in § 381.3(b).</P>
              <P>(v) Traditional Inspection shall be used for turkeys when neither the NTI System nor the NPIS is used. For other classes of poultry, Traditional Inspection shall be used when SIS, NELS, and the NPIS are not used.</P>
              <P>(2) Official establishments that operate under Traditional Inspection, SIS, NELS, NTI, or Ratite Inspection must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) No viscera or any part thereof may be removed from any poultry processed in any official establishment, except at the time of post-mortem inspection, unless its identity with the rest of the carcass is maintained in a manner satisfactory to the inspector until such inspection is made.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each carcass to be eviscerated must be opened so as to expose the organs and the body cavity for proper examination by the inspector.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a carcass is frozen, it must be thoroughly thawed before being opened for examination by an inspector.</P>
              <P>(3) The following requirements are applicable to SIS:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) <E T="03">Cumulative sum (CUSUM).</E> A statistical concept used by the establishment and monitored by the inspector whereby compliance is determined based on sample results collected over a period of time. For purposes of determining compliance with the finished product standards, the CUSUM is equal to the sum of prior test results plus the weighted result of the current test <PRTPAGE P="417"/>minus the tolerance, with the condition that the resulting CUSUM cannot go below zero.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) <E T="03">Tolerance number.</E> A weighted measure that equates to product being produced at a national product quality level. See Table 2.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) <E T="03">Action number.</E> A level reached by the CUSUM where the process is out of control and product action is required by the establishment or the inspector. See Table 2.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) “Start number”. A value halfway between zero and the action number. The start number is used to determine the starting CUSUM for the first subgroup of a shift and to reset the CUSUM value if the CUSUM is equal to or greater than the action number. See Table 2.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) <E T="03">Subgroup.</E> A 10-bird sample collected before product enters the chiller and after product leaves the chiller.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">f</E>) <E T="03">Subgroup absolute limit.</E> The tolerance number plus 5. See Table 2.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">g</E>) <E T="03">Prechill testing.</E> Testing conducted by the establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected prior to product entering the chilling system.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">h</E>) <E T="03">Postchill testing.</E> Testing conducted by the establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected as the product leaves the chilling system.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) <E T="03">Rework.</E> Reprocessing the product to correct the condition or conditions causing the nonconformances listed in Table 1.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">General. (a</E>) Under SIS, one inspector inspects the outside, inside, and viscera of each bird. There may be two inspectors on one processing line, each inspecting every other bird. For the establishment to run its processing line(s) at maximum speed, optimal conditions must be maintained so that inspection may be conducted efficiently. The inspector in charge determines the speed at which each processing line may be operated to permit inspection. A variety of conditions may affect this determination including the health of each flock and the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) SIS may be performed by one inspector (SIS-1) or two inspectors (SIS-2). SIS-1 requires that the establishment provide one inspection station for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The maximum line speed for SIS-1 is 35 birds per minute. SIS-2 requires that the establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The maximum line speed for SIS-2 is 70 birds per minute.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Under all inspection systems, including SIS, inspectors conduct post-mortem inspection and look for a number of conditions, as specified elsewhere in this subpart, which may indicate adulteration. Adulterated product is condemned and destroyed, except that carcasses and parts which may be made unadulterated by reprocessing (reworking) may be so reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and reinspected. Under SIS, inspectors also reinspect product by sampling finished birds (both before and after chilling) for nonconformances with finished product standards (see Table 1). If such nonconformances are present at certain statistical levels, it may indicate process difficulties requiring corrective action by the establishment. If the establishment does not take adequate corrective action, the inspector shall initiate corrective actions such as conducting closer post-mortem inspections and requiring reprocessing and reinspection of previously processed carcasses and parts. Thus, SIS is conducted in two phases—a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. The following paragraphs describe the inspection requirements (not addressed elsewhere in this subpart) under each.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Post-mortem inspection. (a</E>) Facilities: Each inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(c).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Presentation: Each inspector shall be flanked by an establishment employee assigned to be the inspector's helper. The one inspector on the SIS-1 line shall be presented every bird. Each inspector on the SIS-2 line shall be presented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shall present each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward <PRTPAGE P="418"/>the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Each inspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Disposition: The inspector shall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to trim and reinspection. Carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects are not readily observable. Trimming of birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The helper, time permitting, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) One or more plant trimmers positioned after all giblets are harvested and prior to reinspection.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Reinspection. (a</E>) Facilities: Reinspection stations are required at both the prechill and postchill locations. The Agency will determine the number of stations needed in those establishments having more than one processing line or more than one chiller. One or more prechill reinspection stations shall be conveniently located at the end of the line or lines prior to chilling. One or more postchill stations must be conveniently located at the end of the chiller or chillers. The prechill and postchill reinspection stations must meet the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Floor space shall consist of 3 feet along each conveyor line. The space shall be level and protected from all traffic and overhead obstructions.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A table at least 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep and 3 feet in height designed to be readily cleanable and drainable shall be provided for reinspecting the sampled birds.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A minimum of 200 foot-candles of shadow-free lighting with a minimum color rendering index of 85 on the table surface.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A separate clip board holder shall be provided for holding the recording sheets.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Hangback racks designed to hold 10 carcasses shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of the person at the station.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Disposition: An inspector shall monitor the establishment's application of the Finished Product Standards program and shall take corrective action including retaining product to prevent adulterated product from leaving the establishment when the inspector determines that the establishment has failed to apply the program as prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">c</E>) of this section).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Finished Product Standards: Finished Product Standards (FPS) are criteria applied to processed birds before and after chill to ensure that the product being produced is consistently wholesome and unadulterated. These criteria consist of nonconformances (listed in Table 1), the incidence of which is determined from 10 bird subgroup samples, reduced to a CUSUM number, and measured against the standards (Table 2). The standards are applied to permit the Agency to estimate when the production process is in control and when it is out of control. The establishment is responsible for maintaining FPS which, in turn, is monitored by the inspector. FPS is applied in two separate parts. The first is called prechill testing. It is designed to ensure that the slaughter and evisceration procedures are in control. Compliance is measured by determining the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected prior to product entering the chilling system. The second part of the FPS is called postchill testing. It is designed to monitor the production through the chill system to ensure that it meets the postchill FPS. This test is independent of the prechill test. Compliance is measured by determining the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples as they exit the chilling system. When the system is operating within compliance, the establishment applies the FPS to product samples at the prechill reinspection station. Testing time and time between tests are such that birds represented by the test are still within the chiller. If an out-of-compliance condition is found, the <PRTPAGE P="419"/>product leaving the chiller is segregated for rework and retested before it may proceed into commerce. A second 10 bird subgroup sample of the birds is taken after they leave the chiller to ensure that the product meets the postchill FPS. Since the product is closer to the end of processing, the controls on releasing reworked product are stricter than controls under prechill testing, again to ensure that no adulterated product enters into commerce.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) <E T="03">Prechill testing.</E> The prechill FPS have been divided into processing and trim categories. The processing category is designed to monitor the output of the dressing and evisceration procedures. The trim category monitors the establishment's ability to remove unwholesome lesions and conditions from inspected and passed carcasses. Each category is monitored independently of the other category using a separate CUSUM for each category.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Actions to be taken when the process is in control.</E> If the CUSUM is less than the action number and the subgroup absolute limit is not exceeded, the process is judged to be in control.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) Randomly select and record subgroup sampling times for each production unit of time before product reaches the prechill reinspection station on the production line. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 1 hour of production time.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Conduct a 10-bird subgroup test at a random time on each poultry slaughter line. These times are preselected by the establishment and available to the inspector prior to the start of the shift/day's operations. All 10 samples of the subgroup shall be collected at the random time.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">C</E>) Obtain the weighted value of each nonconformance by multiplying the number recorded for each nonconformance by the “factor” in Table 1, sum the total of all the nonconformances, and calculate the CUSUM value for that test.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) Select random times for monitoring subgroup tests for each half-shift on the evisceration line. In establishments that have multiple evisceration lines on a production shift, monitor all lines of product at the random times.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Collect the subgroup samples to be monitored at preselected times. All 10 samples of the subgroup shall be collected at the random time selected in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">d</E>)(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>)(<E T="03">A</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">C</E>) Conduct the 10-bird monitoring subgroup test.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Actions to be taken when the subgroup absolute limit is exceeded.</E> If either an inspector or establishment subgroup test exceeds the subgroup absolute limit of tolerance plus 5 (T + 5), the establishment shall determine if any of the immediate past 5 plant prechill subgroups for that category (processing or trim) resulted in a CUSUM above the start number.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If all of the past 5 plant prechill subgroups are at or below the start number, the establishment shall immediately conduct a retest subgroup on that category of prechill to determine sample validity. If retest subgroup total equals tolerance or less, the establishment resumes random time testing. If the retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">d</E>)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section. In either case, the prechill retest results will be used to calculate CUSUM.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) If any of the past 5 plant prechill subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">d</E>)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Actions to be taken when a trimmable lesion/condition is found.</E> If either inspection or plant monitoring finds any trimmable lesion or condition as specified in item B(7) of Table 1 during a prechill subgroup test, the establishment shall immediately conduct an additional prechill subgroup test for the same trimmable lesion/condition category. This is a requirement on the subgroup testing for the prechill trim nonconformance that is in addition to <PRTPAGE P="420"/>the CUSUM test described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">d</E>)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If no additional item in the same category is found on retest, the establishment shall resume random time sampling.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) If an additional item in the same category is found on retest, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall initiate corrective action set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">d</E>)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section for this category only.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Actions to be taken when the CUSUM reaches the action number.</E> Once CUSUM reaches the action number, the process is judged to be not in control.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) Immediately notify the inspector in charge and the production supervisor responsible for the affected evisceration line.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Suspend random time prechill testing of the affected nonconformance category (processing or trim). Suspend random time postchill subgroup testing when the processing category is the affected nonconformance category.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">C</E>) Conduct subgroup retests on carcasses leaving the chill system. Apply the prechill criteria in Table 1 (A) or (B), depending upon which category caused the action, and apply prechill Finished Product Standards as listed in Table 2 to determine product compliance. In no case shall the time between retests exceed 30 minutes of production time. Apply prechill standard criteria at the postchill location after notifying the establishment's production supervisor. If any of these subgroup retests on product leaving the chill system result in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, identify for rework subsequent product at the postchill location. All noncomplying product will be brought into compliance prior to release into commerce. Product from the chiller will continue accumulating for rework until a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">D</E>) Conduct additional subgroup tests at the prechill reinspection station to determine the adequacy of production corrective action. If the prechill tests results in a subgroup total exceeding the tolerance, notify the production supervisor. The number of additional tests at the postchill reinspection station using prechill standards is increased as required to include the product in the chiller represented by this additional prechill test.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">E</E>) After two consecutive additional prechill subgroup tests result in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance:</P>

              <P>—Resume random time prechill subgroup testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">d</E>)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>—Identify product entering the chill system that will mark the end of the retest action upon arrival at the postchill sampling location. Such identification may include tagging or empty space in chillers, depending upon the establishment's identification method.</P>
              <P>—Once all product identified as needing retesting has arrived at the postchill sampling location, random time postchill FPS testing resumes.</P>
              <P>—If two consecutive additional prechill subgroup tests demonstrate process control with subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance, but they do not cause CUSUM to fall to the start line or below, reset CUSUM at the start number.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall monitor product and process actions by making spot-check observations to ensure that all program requirements are met.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) <E T="03">Postchill testing.</E> Postchill subgroups shall be collected after the product leaves the chiller but before the product is divided into separate processes. Each bird sampled shall be observed and its conformance measured against the postchill criteria. The subgroup nonconformance weights shall be totaled and the CUSUM calculated by subtracting the tolerance from the sum of the subgroup total and the starting CUSUM.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Actions to be taken when the process is in control.</E> If the CUSUM is less than the action number and the subgroup absolute limit is not exceeded, the process is judged to be in control.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall conduct a 10-bird subgroup test for each chiller system at a <PRTPAGE P="421"/>randomly selected time of production. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 2 hours of production time.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) Select random times for postchill monitoring.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Monitor each chill system twice per shift.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">C</E>) Conduct subgroup tests at preselected random times.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Actions to be taken when the subgroup absolute limit is exceeded.</E> If either an inspector or establishment subgroup test exceeds the subgroup absolute limit of tolerance plus 5(T + 5), the establishment shall determine if any of the last 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If all of the past 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM at or below the start number, the establishment shall immediately retest a subgroup to determine sample validity.

              <P>(<E T="03">C</E>) Immediately conduct an additional postchill subgroup test. If the retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall identify subsequent product for rework. Product will continue accumulating for rework until a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">D</E>) After two consecutive additional postchill subgroup tests results in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance:</P>

              <P>—Resume random time postchill subgroup testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(<E T="03">e</E>)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>—If the two consecutive additional postchill subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance do not cause CUSUM to fall to the start number or below, reset CUSUM at the start number.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall monitor product and process actions to ensure that program requirements are met.</P>
              <P>(v) When the prechill or postchill product has been identified as having been produced when the process was not in control, additional online subgroup testing by the establishment is required to determine its conformance to the standard. If any of the additional plant subgroup testing results in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, offline product corrective actions must take place. The responsibilities of the establishment and the inspector change depending on the CUSUM.</P>
              <P>All corrective actions such as identifying affected product, segregating product, and maintaining control through rework actions are the establishment's responsibility. Corrective actions by the inspector depends upon the establishment's ability to control rework of affected product. If the establishment fails in its responsibilities, the inspector will identify, segregate, and retain affected product to prevent adulterated product from reaching consumers.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Offline product. The establishment shall identify the affected product so that it may be segregated and accumulated offline for rework. The inspector shall spot check the establishment's identification, segregation, and control of reworked product to ensure that program requirements are met.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Reworked product. Reworked product must be tested by the establishment with a randomly selected subgroup test of the accumulated reworked lot. Before product is released, the random subgroup test must result <PRTPAGE P="422"/>in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance. If the subgroup test of a reworked lot results in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, the lot must be reworked again before another subgroup is selected. The following actions are required.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Select the random subgroup from throughout the lot only after the total lot has been reworked.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Conduct the subgroup test using the same criteria (prechill or postchill) that resulted in the rework action.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Release the lot if the reworked subgroup test resulted in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Identify and control the lot to be reworked if the reworked subgroup total again exceeds tolerance.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Inspector Actions: The inspector shall spot check the rework procedure to ensure that plant monitoring and production meet the requirements of the program.</P>
              <P>(vi) After the 10 bird subgroup tests are completed, the prechill and postchill processing nonconformances shall be corrected on all bird samples prior to returning the samples to the product flow. Samples with trim nonconformances shall be returned to the trim station for correction prior to their return to the product flow.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) <E T="03">Post-mortem inspection.</E> The establishment shall provide three inspection stations on each eviscerating line in compliance with the facility requirements § 381.36(d)(1). The three inspectors shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. Each inspector shall be flanked by two establishment employees—the presenter and the helper. The presenter shall ensure that the bird is properly eviscerated and presented for inspection and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. The inspector shall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection. Poultry carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects are not readily observable. Trimming or birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The helper, time permitting, and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) One or more plant trimmers positioned after giblet harvest and prior to reinspection.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) A reinspection station shall be located at the end of each line. This station shall comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(d)(2).

              <P>(i) Inspection under the NTI System is conducted in two phases, a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. The NTI-1 Inspection System requires that the establishment provide one inspection station for each line and adequate reinspection facilitiates so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The NTI-2 Inspection System requires that the establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) <E T="03">Post-mortem inspection.</E> Each inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(e)(1). Each inspector shall be flanked by and establishment employee assigned to be the inspector's helper. The one inspector on an NTI-1 Inspection System shall be presented every bird. Each inspector on an NTI-2 Inspection System line shall be presented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shall present each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Each inspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. The inspector shall determine which bird shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by a veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird <PRTPAGE P="426"/>subject to reinspection. Turkey carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects of birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:</P>

              <P>(B) Any carcasses removed from the line for reprocessing activities or salvage must be returned to the line before the online carcass inspection station. The establishment must include in its written HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program a process by which parts, other than parts identified as “major portions” as defined in § 381.170(b)(22), are available for inspection offline after reprocessing or salvage.</P>
              <P>(C) The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to ensure that poultry carcasses contaminated with septicemic and toxemic conditions do not enter the chiller. The establishment must incorporate these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program. These procedures must cover, at a minimum, establishment sorting activities required under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) The establishment must maintain records to document that the products resulting from its slaughter operation meet the definition of ready-to-cook poultry in § 381.1. These records are subject to review and evaluation by FSIS personnel.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Presentation for online carcass inspection.</E> To ensure the online carcass inspector may properly inspect every carcass, the establishment must present carcasses as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Each carcass, except carcasses and parts identified as “major portions” under 9 CFR 381.179(b)(22), must be held by a single shackle;</P>

The administrator may approve the use of abbreviations of such inspection mark; and such approved abbreviations shall have the same force and effect as the inspection mark. The official inspection legend, or the approved abbreviation thereof, shall be printed on consumer packages and other immediate containers of inspected and passed poultry products, or on labels to be securely affixed to such containers of such products and may be printed or stenciled thereon, but shall not be applied by rubber stamping. When applied by a stencil, the legend shall not be less than 4 inches in diameter. An official brand must be applied to inspected and passed carcasses and parts of ratites that are shipped unpacked.</P>

In determining the sufficiency of the available space, except as otherwise prescribed in this part, any vignettes, designs, and any other nonmandatory information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all required information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between the principal display panel and the information panel, provided that the information required by any given provision of this part, such as the ingredients statement, is not divided and appears on the same panel.</P>

              <P>(b) The name of the product required to be shown on labels for fresh or frozen raw whole carcasses of poultry <PRTPAGE P="436"/>shall be in either of the following forms: The name of the kind (such as chicken, turkey, or duck) preceded by the qualifying term “young” or “mature” or “old”, whichever is appropriate; or the appropriate class name as described in § 381.170(a). The name of the kind may be used in addition to the class name, but the name of the kind alone without the qualifying age or class term is not acceptable as the name of the product, except that the name “chicken” may be used without such qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen cut-up young chickens, or a half of a young chicken, and the name “duckling” may be used without such qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen young ducks. The class name may be appropriately modified by changing the word form, such as using the term “roasting chicken”, rather than “roaster.” The appropriate names for cut-up parts are set forth in § 381.170(b). When naming parts cut from young poultry, the identity of both the kind of poultry and the name of the part shall be included in the product name. The product name for parts or portions cut from mature poultry shall include, along with the part or portion name, the class name or the qualifying term “mature.” The name of the product for cooked or heat processed poultry products shall include the kind name of the poultry from which the product was prepared but need not include the class name or the qualifying term “mature.”</P>
              <P>(c) Poultry products containing light and dark chicken or turkey meat in quantities other than the natural proportions, as indicated in Table 1 in this paragraph, must have a qualifying statement in conjunction with the name of the product indicating, as shown in Table 1, the types of meat actually used, except that when the product contains less than 10 percent cooked deboned poultry meat or is processed in such a manner that the character of the light and dark meat is not distinguishable, the qualifying statement will not be required, unless the product bears a label referring to the light or dark meat content. In the latter case, the qualifying statement is required if the light and dark meat are not present in natural proportions. The qualifying statement must be in type at least one-half the size and of equal boldness as the name of the product; e.g., Boned Turkey (Dark Meat).</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The label shall show a statement of the ingredients in the poultry product if the product is fabricated from two or more ingredients. Such ingredients shall be listed by their common or usual names in the order of their descending proportions, except as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) Product ingredients which are present in individual amounts of 2 percent or less by weight may be listed in the ingredients statement in other than descending order of predominance: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such ingredients are listed by their common or usual names at the end of the ingredients statement and preceded by a quantifying statement, such as “Contains _____ percent or less of _____ ,” or “Less than _____ percent of _____ .” The percentage of the ingredient(s) shall be filled in with a threshold level of 2 percent, 1.5 percent, 1.0 percent, or 0.5 percent, as appropriate. No ingredient to which the quantifying statement applies may be present in an amount greater than the stated threshold. Such a quantifying statement may also be utilized when an ingredients statement contains a listing of ingredients by individual components. Each component listing may utilize the required quantifying statement at the end of each component ingredients listing.</P>

              <P>(ii) Such ingredients may be adjusted in the product formulation without a change being made in the ingredients statement on the labeling, provided that the adjusted amount complies with subpart P of this part and § 424.21(c) of subchapter E, and does not <PRTPAGE P="438"/>exceed the amount shown in the quantifying statement. Any such adjustments to the formulation shall be provided to the inspector-in-charge.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “chicken meat,” unless modified by an appropriate adjective, is construed to mean deboned white and dark meat; whereas the term “chicken” may include other edible parts such as skin and fat not in excess of their natural proportions, in addition to the chicken meat. If the term “chicken meat” is listed and the product also contains skin, giblets, or fat, it is necessary to list each such ingredient. Similar principles shall be followed in listing ingredients of poultry products processed from other kinds of poultry.</P>
              <P>(c) The terms spice, natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may be used in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) The term “spice” means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, with the exceptions of onions, garlic and celery, whose primary function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in 21 CFR 182.10, and 184.</P>
              <P>(2) The term “natural flavor,” “natural flavoring,” “flavor” or “flavoring” means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portions of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powdered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.</P>
              <P>(i) Natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring as described in paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section, which are also colors shall be designated as “natural flavor and coloring,” “natural flavoring and coloring,” “flavor and coloring” or “flavoring and coloring” unless designated by their common or usual name.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any ingredient not designated in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of livestock or poultry origin must be designated by names that include the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients are derived.</P>

              <P>(d) On containers of frozen dinners, entrees, and pizzas, and similarly packaged products in cartons, the ingredient statement may be placed on the front riser panel: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the words “see ingredients,” followed immediately by an arrow pointing to the front riser panel, are placed on the principal display panel immediately above the location of such statement, without intervening printing or designs.</P>
              <P>(e) The ingredients statement may be placed on the information panel, except as otherwise permitted in this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(f) Establishments may interchange the identity of two kinds of poultry (e.g., chicken and turkey, chicken meat and turkey meat) used in a product formulation without changing the product's ingredient statement or product name under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) The two kinds of poultry used must comprise at least 70 percent by weight of the poultry and the poultry ingredients [e.g. giblets, skin or fat in excess of natural proportions, or mechanically separated (kind)] used; and,</P>
              <P>(ii) Neither of the two kinds of poultry used can be less than 30 percent by weight of the total poultry and poultry ingredients used;</P>

              <P>(2) The word “and” in lieu of a comma must be shown between the declaration of the two kinds of poultry <PRTPAGE P="439"/>in the ingredients statement and in the product name.</P>

              <P>(a) The label shall bear a statement of the quantity of contents in terms of weight or measures as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. However, the Administrator may approve the use of labels for certain types of consumer packages which do not bear a statement of the net weight that would otherwise be required under this subparagraph: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the shipping container bears a statement “Net weight to be marked on consumer packages prior to display and sale”: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That the total net weight of the contents of the shipping container is marked on such container: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That the shipping container bears a statement “Tare weight of consumer package” and in close proximity thereto, the actual tare weight (weight of packaging material), weighed to the nearest one-eighth ounce or less, of the individual consumer package in the shipping container. The above-specified statements may be added to approved shipping container labels upon approval by the inspector in charge.</P>

              <P>(b) When a poultry product and a nonpoultry product are separately <PRTPAGE P="440"/>wrapped and are placed in a single immediate container bearing the same name of both products, the net weight on such immediate container may be the total net weight of the products, or such immediate container may show the net weights of the poultry product and the nonpoultry product separately. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, the label on consumer size retail packages of stuffed poultry and other stuffed poultry products must show the total net weight of the poultry product, and in close proximity thereto, a statement specifying the minimum weight of the poultry in the product.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The statement of net quantity of contents shall appear (except as otherwise permitted under this paragraph (c)), on the principal display panel of all containers to be sold at retail intact, in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other matter on the container, and shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c). An unused tare weight, as defined in section 381.121b of this subchapter, may be printed adjacent to the statement of net quantity of contents when the product is packaged totally with impervious packaging material and is packed with a usable medium.</P>

              <P>(2) The statement shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the panel, in lines generally parallel to the base: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the statement meets the other requirements of this paragraph. The declaration may appear in more than one line.</P>
              <P>(3) The statement shall be in letters and numerals in type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:</P>
              <P>(i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches;</P>
              <P>(iii) Not less than three-sixteenth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches;</P>
              <P>(iv) Not less than one-quarter inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 but not more than 400 square inches;</P>
              <P>(v) Not less than one-half inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 400 square inches.</P>
              <P>(vi) The ratio of height to width of letters and numerals shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide). This height standard pertains to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the height standards.</P>
              <P>(4) The statement shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel and shall be separated, from other label information appearing to the left or right of the statement, by a space at least equal in width to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement and shall be separated from other label information appearing above or below the statement by a space at least equal in height to the height of the lettering used in the statement.</P>

              <P>(5) The terms “net weight” or “net wt.” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight, and the term “net contents” or “contents” when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of fluid measure. Except as provided in § 381.128, the statement shall be expressed in terms of avoirdupois weight or liquid measure. Where no general consumer usage to the contrary exists, the statement shall be in terms of liquid measure, if the product is liquid, or in terms of <PRTPAGE P="441"/>weight if the product is solid, semisolid, viscous or a mixture of solid and liquid. On packages containing less than 1 pound or 1 pint, the statement shall be expressed in ounces or fractions of a pint, respectively. On packages containing 1 pound or 1 pint or more, and less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon, the statement shall be expressed as a dual declaration both in ounces and (immediately thereafter in parenthesis) in pounds, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pint or quart. For example, a declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 12 oz.”; a declaration of 1<FR>1/2</FR> pounds avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 24 oz. (1 lb. 8 oz.),” “Net Wt. 24 oz. (1<FR>1/2</FR> lb.),” or “Net Wt. 24 oz. (1.5 lbs.).” However, on random weight packages the statement shall be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound, for packages over 1 pound, and for packages which do not exceed 1 pound the statement may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces. The numbers may be written in provided the unit designation is printed. Paragraphs (c) (8) and (9) of this section permit certain exceptions to this paragraph for multi-unit packages, and random weight consumer size and small packages (less than <FR>1/2</FR> ounce), respectively.</P>
              <P>(6) The statement as it is shown on a label shall not be false or misleading and shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the container. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practices will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall be as provided in section 381.121b of this subchapter. The statement shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count such as “jumbo quart,” “full gallon,” “giant quart,” “when packed,” “minimum,” or words of similar importance except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) Labels for containers which bear any representation as to the number of servings contained therein shall bear, contiguous to such representation, and in the same size type as is used for such representation, a statement of the net quantity of each such serving.</P>
              <P>(8) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and subdivisions thereof, as otherwise required by this paragraph (c). “A multiunit retail package” is a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, with the individual packages intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being sold individually. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units and the labeling thereon are not subject to this paragraph (c) (8) if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of this paragraph (c).</P>
              <P>(9) The following exemptions from the requirements contained in this section are hereby established:</P>

              <P>(i) Individually wrapped, random weight consumer size packages of poultry products (as specified in paragraph (c)(10) of this section) and poultry products that are subject to shrinkage through moisture loss during good distribution practices and are designated as gray area type of products as defined in NBS handbook 133, section 3.18.2, need not bear a net weight statement when shipped from an official establishment provided a net weight shipping statement which meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section is applied to the shipping container prior to shipping it from the official establishment. Net weight statements so applied to the shipping container are exempt from the type size, <PRTPAGE P="442"/>dual declaration, and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the shipping container. The net weight also shall be applied directly to random weight consumer size packages prior to retail display and sale. The net weight statement of random weight consumer size packages for retail sale shall be exempt from the type size, dual declaration, and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.</P>
              <P>(ii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than <FR>1/2</FR> ounce net weight and random weight consumer size packages shall be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they are in a shipping container and the statement of net quantity of contents on the shipping container meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than <FR>1/2</FR> ounce net weight bearing labels declaring net weight, price per pound, and total price, shall be exempt from the type size, dual declaration, and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.</P>
              <P>(10) As used in this section a “random weight consumer size package” is one of a lot, shipment or delivery of packages of the same product, with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern.</P>

However, established trade names and other labeling and containers which are not false or misleading and which are approved by the Administrator in the regulations or in specific cases are permitted.</P>

              <P>(b) No statement, word, picture, design, or device which is false or misleading in any particular or conveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin, identity, or quality, shall appear on any label. For example:<PRTPAGE P="445"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Official grade designations such as the letter grades A, B, and C may be used in labeling individual carcasses of poultry or containers of poultry products only if such articles have been graded by a licensed grader of the Federal or Federal-State poultry grading service and found to qualify for the indicated grade.</P>
              <P>(2) Terms having geographical significance with reference to a particular locality may be used only when the product was produced in that locality.</P>
              <P>(3) “Fresh frozen”, “quick frozen”, “frozen fresh”, and terms of similar import apply only to ready-to-cook poultry processed in accordance with § 381.66(f)(1). Ready-to-cook poultry handled in any other manner and dressed poultry may be labeled “frozen” only if it is frozen in accordance with § 381.66(f)(2) under Department supervision and is in fact in a frozen state. “Individually quick frozen (Kind)” and terms of similar import are applicable only to poultry products that are frozen as stated on the label and whose component parts can be easily separated at time of packing.</P>
              <P>(4) Poultry products labeled with a term quoted in any paragraph of § 381.170(b) shall comply with the specifications in the applicable paragraph. However, parts of poultry may be cut in any manner the processor desires as long as the labeling appropriately reflects the contents of the container of such poultry.</P>
              <P>(5) The terms “All,” “Pure,” “100%,” and terms of similar connotation shall not be used on labels for products to identify ingredient content, unless the product is prepared solely from a single ingredient.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) A raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26  °F may not bear a label declaration of “fresh.” A raw poultry product bearing a label declaration of “fresh” but whose internal temperature has ever been below 26  °F is mislabeled. The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product within an official establishment may deviate below the 26  °F standard by 1 degree (i.e., have a temperature of 25  °F) and still be labeled “fresh.” The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product outside an official establishment may deviate below the 26  °F standard by 2 degrees (i.e., have a temperature of 24  °F) and still be labeled “fresh.” The average temperature of poultry product lots of each specific product type must be 26  °F. Product described in this paragraph is not subject to the freezing procedures required in § 381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been at or below 0°F must be labeled with the descriptive term “frozen,” except when such labeling duplicates or conflicts with the labeling requirements in § 381.125 of this subchapter. The word “previously” may be placed next to the term “frozen” on an optional basis. The descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing the descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently affixed to the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. Product described in this paragraph is subject to the freezing procedures required in § 381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>(iii) Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F, but is above 0 °F, is not required to bear any specific descriptive term. Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F, but is above 0 °F, may bear labeling with an optional, descriptive term, provided the optional, descriptive term does not cause the raw poultry product to become misbranded. If used, an optional, descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing the optional, descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently affixed on the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.<PRTPAGE P="446"/>

The transportation of the product may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported or to another official establishment designated by the person desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for the purpose of the relabeling of the product. The Area Supervisor shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product and shall provide a copy of the record to the inspector at the establishment receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.</P>
              <P>(B) Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment, a careful inspection shall be made of the product by the inspector, and if it is found that the product is not adulterated, it may be received into the establishment; but if the product is found to be adulterated, it shall at once be condemned and disposed of in accordance with § 381.95 of this subchapter. Wholesome product will be relabeled in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(C) When any inspected and passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has been transported from an official establishment, the owner may transport the product in commerce to a retail entity for relabeling in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate, or to other end users, such as hotels, restaurants or similar institutions; or, relabel the product in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate if the product is already at a retail entity. A hotel, restaurant or similar institution is not required to relabel product misbranded under this subpart; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the product is prepared in meals or as entrees only for sale or service directly to individual consumers at such institutions, and that the mark of inspection is removed or obliterated. Oral permission shall be obtained from the Area Officer-in-Charge of the Compliance Program for the area in which the product is located prior to such transportation or relabeling. The Area Officer-in-Charge shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product, and shall furnish a copy of the authorization record upon request. Before being offered for sale at a retail entity, such product shall be relabeled.</P>
              <P>(v) Ready-to-cook chicken may bear the claim “air chilled” or “air chilling” on its label only if the product was chilled under a process that meets the definition of air chilling in § 381.66(e).</P>
              <P>(c) A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year identification to be misleading.</P>
              <P>(2) Immediately adjacent to the calendar date will be a phrase explaining the meaning of such date in terms of “packing” date, “sell by” date, or “use before” date, with or without a further qualifying phrase, e.g., “For Maximum Freshness” or “For Best Quality.”</P>
              <P>(d) When sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate are used together in a dry binding matrix in ground or formed poultry products, as permitted in § 424.21(c) of subchapter E, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the product name a statement to indicate the use of sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate.</P>

              <P>(e) When transglutaminase enzyme is used to bind pieces of poultry to form a cut of poultry, or to reform a piece of poultry from a multiple cuts of poultry, there shall appear on the label, as <PRTPAGE P="447"/>part of the product name, a statement that indicates that the product has been “formed” or “reformed,” in addition to other preparation steps, e.g., “Formed Turkey Thigh Roast” or “Reformed and Shaped Chicken Breast.”</P>
              <P>(f) A country of origin statement on the label of any poultry product “covered commodity” as defined in 7 CFR part 65, subpart A, that is to be sold by a “retailer,” as defined in 7 CFR 65.240, must comply with the requirements in 7 CFR 65.300 and 65.400.</P>

              <P>(a) Edible products may not be packaged in a container which is composed in whole or in part of any poisonous or deleterious substances which may render the contents adulterated or injurious to health. All packaging materials must be safe for the intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FFDCA).</P>
              <P>(b) Packaging materials entering the official establishment must be accompanied or covered by a guaranty, or statement of assurance, from the packaging supplier under whose brand name and firm name the material is marketed to the official establishment. The guaranty shall state that the material's intended use complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations. The guaranty must identify the material, e.g., by the distinguishing brand name or code designation appearing on the packaging material shipping container; must specify the applicable conditions of use, including temperature limits and other pertinent limits specified under the FFDCA and food additive regulations; and must be signed by an authorized official of the supplying firm. The guaranty may be limited to a specific shipment of an article, in which case it may be part of or attached to the invoice covering such shipment, or it may be general and continuing, in which case, in its application to any article or other shipment of an article, it shall be considered to have been given at the date such article was shipped by the person who gives the guaranty. Guaranties consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's regulations regarding such guaranties (21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13) will be acceptable. The management of the establishment must maintain a file containing guaranties for all food contact packaging materials in the establishment. The file shall be made available to Program inspectors or other Department officials upon request. While in the official establishment, the identity of all packaging materials must be traceable to the applicable guaranty.</P>
              <P>(c) The guaranty by the packaging supplier will be accepted by Program inspectors to establish that the use of material complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations.</P>

              <P>(d) The Department will monitor the use of packaging materials in official establishments to assure that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and may question the basis for any guaranty described under paragraph (b) of this section. Official establishments and packaging suppliers providing written guaranties to those official establishments will be permitted an opportunity to provide information to designated Department officials as needed to verify the basis <PRTPAGE P="450"/>for any such guaranty. The required information will include, but is not limited to, manufacturing firm's name, trade name or code designation for the material, complete chemical composition, and use. Selection of a material for review does not in itself affect a material's acceptability. Materials may continue to be used during the review period. However, if information requested from the supplier is not provided within the time indicated in the request—a minimum of 30 days—any applicable guaranty shall cease to be effective and approval to continue using the specified packaging material in official establishments may be denied. The Administrator may extend this time where reasonable grounds for extension are shown, as, for example, where data must be obtained from suppliers.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator may disapprove for use in official establishments packaging materials whose use cannot be confirmed as complying with the FFDCA and applicable food additive regulations. Before approval to use a packaging material is finally denied by the Administrator, the affected official establishment and the supplier of the material shall be given notice and the opportunity to present their views to the Administrator. If the official establishment and the supplier do not accept the Administrator's determination, a hearing in accordance with applicable rules of practice will be held to resolve such dispute. Approval to use the materials pending the outcome of the presentation of views or hearing shall be denied if the Administrator determines that such use may present an imminent hazard to public health.</P>
              <P>(f) Periodically, the Administrator will issue to inspectors a listing, by distinguishing brand name or code designation, of packaging materials that have been reviewed and that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Listed materials will not be permitted for use in official establishments. If a subsequent review of any material indicates that it meets the requirements of paragraph (a), the material will be deleted from the listing.</P>
              <P>(g) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of Program inspectors to refuse a specific material if he/she determines the material may render products adulterated or injurious to health.</P>

              <P>(a) No poultry product (including poultry broth for use in any poultry product in any official establishment) may be brought into any official establishment unless it has been processed in the United States only in an official establishment or imported from a foreign country eligible to export such poultry and poultry products to the United States under § 381.196(b), and inspected and passed, in accordance with the regulations; and unless the container of such product is marked so as to identify the product as so inspected and passed, in accordance with § 381.115 or § 381.205, except that poultry products inspected and passed and identified as such under the laws of an “at least equal” State or territory listed in § 381.187 may be brought into any official establishment solely for storage and distribution therefrom without repackaging, relabeling, or processing in such establishment. No carcass, part thereof, meat or meat food product of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines may be brought into an official establishment unless it has been prepared in the United States only in an official meat packing establishment, or imported, and inspected and passed, in accordance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and the regulations under such Act (Subchapter A of this chapter) and is properly marked as so inspected and passed; or has been inspected and passed and is identified as such in accordance with the requirements of the law and regulations of a State not designated in § 331.2 of this chapter; or is present in the official establishment by reason of an exemption <PRTPAGE P="451"/>allowed in the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the regulations under such Act (Subchapter A of this chapter) or the law and regulations of a State not so designated. However, such exempted articles may enter only under conditions approved by the Administrator in specific cases, including but not limited to, complete separation of inspected poultry products and processing and other operations with respect thereto from the exempted articles and operations with respect thereto, complete cleanup of facilities and equipment between processing of inspected poultry products and the exempted articles and no commingling of inspected and exempted articles in receiving, holding or storage areas.</P>
              <P>(b) All poultry products and all carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines which enter any official establishment shall be identified by the operator of the official establishment at the time of receipt at the official establishment. All poultry products, and all carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of such animals, which are processed or otherwise handled at any official establishment shall be subject to examination by an inspector at the official establishment in such manner and at such times as may be deemed necessary by the inspector in charge to assure compliance with the regulations. Upon such examination, if any such article or portion thereof is found to be adulterated, such article or portion shall, in the case of poultry products, be condemned and disposed of as prescribed in § 381.95, unless by reprocessing they may be made not adulterated, and shall, in the case of such other articles be disposed of according to applicable law.</P>
              <FP>Such examination may be accomplished through use of statistically sound sampling plans that assure a high level of confidence. The inspector in charge shall designate the type of plan and the program employee shall select the specific plan to be used in accordance with instructions issued by the Administrator. <SU>1</SU>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authorization to establish specifications.</E> (1) The Administrator is authorized to establish specifications or definitions and standards of identity or composition, covering the principal constituents of any poultry product with respect to which a specified name of the product or other labeling terminology may be used, whenever he determines such action is necessary to prevent sale of the product under false or misleading labeling. Further, the Administrator is authorized to prescribe definitions and standards of identity or composition for poultry products whenever he determines such action is otherwise necessary for the protection of the public. The requirements of this subpart are hereby found to be necessary for these purposes and standards are hereby established as set forth in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Where cooked poultry meat is specified in this subpart as an ingredient of poultry products, this means poultry meat derived from poultry processed, cooked, and cooled in a manner approved by the Administrator in specific cases without use of liquid or moisture in direct contact with the poultry meat following the cooking and cooling of the poultry.</P>

              <P>(3) If, following cooking and cooling of poultry meat to be used in poultry products, liquid or moisture is used in direct contact with such poultry meat and the percentage of solids, excluding salt, in the poultry meat is found to be <PRTPAGE P="456"/>below 34 percent when such poultry meat is tested by acceptable methods, the percentage of poultry meat required by this section for any poultry product shall be increased in proportion to the deficiency, or the meat shall be so processed as to raise the solids content, excluding salt, to 34 percent. The official establishment shall furnish adequate facilities for such testing.</P>
              <P>(b) Any binder or antimicrobial agent that has been found to be safe and suitable by the Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and Inspection Service may be used in the production of poultry products with standards of identity in this part, where the product standards and applicable Federal regulations already permit the use of these types of ingredients.</P>

              <P>(1) “Breasts” shall be separated from the back at the shoulder joint and by a cut running backward and downward from that point along the junction of the vertebral and sternal ribs. The ribs may be removed from the breasts, and the breasts may be cut along the breastbone to make two approximately equal halves; or the wishbone portion, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, may be removed before cutting the remainder along the breastbone to make three parts. Pieces cut in this manner may be substituted for lighter or heavier pieces for exact weight-making purposes and the package may contain two or more of such parts without affecting the appropriateness of the labeling as e.g., “chicken breasts.” Neck skin shall not be included with the <PRTPAGE P="460"/>breasts, except that “turkey breasts” may include neck skin up to the whisker.</P>
              <P>(2) “Breasts with ribs” shall be separated from the back at the junction of the vertebral ribs and back. Breasts with ribs may be cut along the breastbone to make two approximately equal halves; or the wishbone portion, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, may be removed before cutting the remainder along the breastbone to make three parts. Pieces cut in this manner may be substituted for lighter or heavier pieces for exact weight-making purposes and the package may contain two or more of such parts without affecting the appropriateness of the labeling as “breasts with ribs.” Neck skin shall not be included, except that “turkey breasts with ribs” may include neck skin up to the whisker.</P>

Neck skin shall not be included with the wishbone.</P>
              <P>(4) “Drumsticks” shall be separated from the thigh by a cut through the knee joint (femorotibial and patellar joint) and from the hock joint (tarsal joint).</P>
              <P>(5) “Thighs” shall be disjointed at the hip joint and may include the pelvic meat, but shall not include the pelvic bones. Back skin shall not be included.</P>
              <P>(6) “(Kind) legs” shall be the poultry product which includes the thigh and the drumstick, i.e., the whole leg, and may include the pelvic meat, but shall not include the pelvic bones. Back skin shall not be included.</P>
              <P>(7) “Wings” shall include the entire wing with all muscle and skin tissue intact, except that the wingtip may be removed.</P>
              <P>(8) “Backs” shall include the pelvic bones and all the vertebrae posterior to the shoulder joint. The meat shall not be peeled from the pelvic bones.

              <P>(9) “Stripped backs” shall include the vertebrae from the shoulder joint to the tail, and include the pelvic bones. The meat may be stripped off of the pelvic bones.</P>
              <P>(10) “Necks”, with or without neck skin, shall be separated from the carcass at the shoulder joint.</P>
              <P>(11) “Halves” are prepared by making a full-length back and breast split of an eviscerated poultry carcass so as to produce approximately equal right and left sides.</P>
              <P>(12) “Quarters” consist of the entire eviscerated poultry carcass, which has been cut into four equal parts, but excluding the neck.</P>
              <P>(13) “Breast quarter” consists of half a breast with the wing and a portion of the back attached.</P>
              <P>(14) “Breast quarter without wing” consists of a front quarter of a poultry carcass, from which the wing has been removed.</P>
              <P>(15) “Leg quarter” consists of a poultry thigh and drumstick, with a portion of the back attached.</P>
              <P>(16) “Thigh with back portion” consists of a poultry thigh with back portion attached.</P>
              <P>(17) “Legs with pelvic bone” consists of a poultry leg with adhering meat and skin and pelvic bone.</P>
              <P>(18) “Wing drummette” consists of the humerus of a poultry wing with adhering skin and meat attached.</P>
              <P>(19) “Wing portion” consists of a poultry wing except that the drummette has been removed.</P>

              <P>(21) “Giblets” consist of approximately equal numbers of hearts, gizzards, and livers, as determined on a count basis.</P>
              <P>(22) “Major portions” of eviscerated poultry carcasses are either carcasses from which parts may be missing, or the front or rear portions of transversely-split carcasses.</P>

              <P>(a) “Turkey Ham” shall be fabricated from boneless, turkey thigh meat with skin and the surface fat attached to the skin removed. The thighs shall be that cut of poultry described in § 381.170(b)(5) of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The product may or may not be smoked, and shall be cured using one or more of the approved curing agents as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B. The product may also contain cure accelerators, phosphates, and flavoring agents as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B; common salt, sugars, spices, spice extractives, dehydrated garlic, and dehydrated onions; and water for purpose of dissolving and dispersing the substances specified above.</P>
              <P>(c) The cooked finished product weight shall be no more than the original weight of the turkey thigh meat used prior to curing.</P>
              <P>(d) The product name on the label shall show the word “Turkey” in the same size, style, color, and with the same background as the word “Ham” and shall precede and be adjacent to it.</P>
              <P>(e) The product name shall be qualified with the statement “Cured Turkey Thigh Meat.” The qualifying statement shall be contiguous to the product name, without intervening type or designs, shall be not less than one-half the size of the product name but not less than one-eighth inch in height, and shall be in the same style and color and with the same background as the product name.</P>
              <P>(f) If the product is fabricated from pieces of turkey thigh meat that result from the cutting through the muscle (as opposed the whole thighs intact or whole thighs with some incidental separation of muscle tissue during removal of the bone), the product name shall be further qualified by a descriptive statement. The product name of product fabricated from such pieces of turkey thigh meat equivalent in size to a one-half inch cube or greater shall be further qualified to specify that the product is “Chunked and Formed.” The product name of product fabricated from such pieces of turkey thigh meat smaller than the equivalent of a one-half inch cube shall be further qualified to specify that the product is “Ground and Formed” or “Chopped and Formed” as appropriate. The qualifying statement shall immediately follow and be contiguous to the statement required in paragraph (e) of this section, and shall be not less than one-half the size of the product name but not less than one-eighth inch in height, and shall be in the same style and color and with the same background as the product name.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The poultry products prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those products that substitute, in accordance with § 381.413(d), for a standardized product defined in this subpart and use the name of that standardized product in their statements of identity, but that do not comply with the established standard because of a compositional deviation that results from reduction of a constituent that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by regulation in this subpart. The expressed nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 381.413 and with the requirements in subpart Y of this part which define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The poultry product shall comply with the relevant standard in this part in all other respects, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance characteristics.</E> The performance characteristics, such as physical properties, functional properties, and shelf-life, of the poultry product shall be similar to those of the standardized poultry product produced under subpart P of this part. If there is a significant difference in a performance characteristic that materially <PRTPAGE P="462"/>limits the use of the product compared to the use of the standardized product defined in subpart P of this part, the label shall include a statement in accordance with § 381.413(d)(1) and (2) of this part, that informs the consumer of such differences (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, if appropriate, “not recommended for frozen storage” or “not suitable for roller grilling”). Deviations from the ingredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim, while maintaining similar performance characteristics.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ingredients used in substitute products.</E> (1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for in the standard as defined in subpart P of this part, except that safe and suitable ingredients permitted for use in poultry products as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, may be used at the minimum level necessary to improve texture and prevent syneresis, so that the substitute product is not inferior in performance characteristics from the standardized product defined in subpart P of this part for which it is a substitute.</P>
              <P>(2) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard prescribed in subpart P of this part shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source, for example, extruded turnips shall not replace noodles in poultry with noodles.</P>
              <P>(3) An ingredient that is specifically prohibited from use in any poultry product by subpart P of this part shall not be added to the substitute poultry product under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless otherwise specified in this part, a substitute poultry product must meet all other requirements of the applicable standards of identity or composition.</P>
              <P>(5) Water and fat-replacers (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, binders), in combination, may be added to replace fat in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) Textured vegetable protein may be used by itself or in combination with other binders and water as a fat replacer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Nomenclature.</E> The name of a substitute poultry product that complies with this section is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> (1) Each of the ingredients used in the substitute poultry product shall be declared on the label as required by this section and subpart N of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in subpart P of this part, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular _____” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product) or “**Ingredients in excess of amounts permitted in regular _____” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product), or both, as appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same type and size.</P>

              <P>(b) “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” shall not have a bone solids content of more than 1 percent. At least 98 percent of the bone particles present in “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry) “ shall have a maximum size no greater than 1.5 mm (millimeter) in their greatest dimension and there shall be no bone particles larger than 2.0 mm in their greatest dimension.</P>

              <P>(c) “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.235 percent when made from mature chickens or from <PRTPAGE P="463"/>turkeys as defined in § 381.170(a)(l)(vi) and (vii) and (a)(2), respectively, or 0.175 percent when made from other poultry, based on the weight of product that has not been heat treated, as a measure of a bone solids content of not more than 1 percent.</P>
              <P>(d) “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” may be used in the formulation of poultry products in accordance with § 381.174 and meat food products in accordance with subchapter A of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) Product resulting from the mechanical separation process that fails to meet the bone particle size or calcium content requirements for “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” shall be used only in producing poultry extractives, including fats, stocks, and broths and labeled as “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry) for Further Processing.”</P>

Such cooperation is authorized if the jurisdiction has enacted a mandatory law imposing ante mortem and post mortem inspection, reinspection, and sanitation requirements (at least equal to those under the Federal Act), with respect to all or certain classes of persons engaged in slaughtering poultry or otherwise processing poultry products for use as human food solely for distribution within such jurisdiction.</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator is also authorized under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Act, to cooperate with any State <PRTPAGE P="466"/>(including Puerto Rico) or any organized territory in developing and administering programs under the laws of such jurisdiction containing authorities at least equal to those provided in section 11 of the Act (relating to records; registration of specified classes of operators; dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry; and products not intended for human food) when he determines that such cooperation would effectuate the purposes of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) Such cooperation may include advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial aid. The Federal contribution to any State (or territory) for any year shall not exceed 50 percent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative State (or territorial) program. A cooperative program under this section is called a State-Federal program.</P>

A cooperative program for this purpose is called a “cooperative interstate shipment program.”</P>
              <P>(b) Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program described in this section must receive inspection services from designated State personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel determine that the poultry products prepared in establishments selected to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce. The Administrator will assign an FSIS “selected establishment coordinator,” who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's requirements.

              <P>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, no animal food processed, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of poultry in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation in commerce, or imported, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) It is properly identified as animal food;</P>

              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of poultry and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the poultry industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95 if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appears on the label in a conspicuous manner.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be stated in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from carcasses of poultry.</P>

              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains poultry carcass-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Chicken for Pets” or “Turkey Dinner for Cats”: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass, but shall not be less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch high.

              <P>(a)(1) Whenever it shall be determined by the Administrator that the system of poultry inspection maintained by any foreign country, with respect to establishments preparing products in such country for export to the United States, insures compliance of such establishments and their poultry products, with requirements equivalent to all the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this part which are applied to official establishments in the United States, and their poultry products, and that reliance can be placed upon certificates required under this subpart from authorities of such foreign country, notice of that fact will be given in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, poultry products processed in such establishments which are certified and approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be eligible, so far as the regulations in this part are concerned, for importation into the United States from such foreign country after applicable requirements of this part have been met.</P>
              <P>(2) The determination of acceptability of a foreign poultry inspection system for purposes of this section shall be based on an evaluation of the foreign program in accordance with the following requirements and procedures:</P>
              <P>(i) The system shall have a program organized and administered by the national government of the foreign country. The system as implemented must provide standards equivalent to those of the Federal system of poultry inspection in the United States with respect to:</P>
              <P>(A) Organizational structure and staffing, so as to insure uniform enforcement of the requisite laws and regulations in all establishments throughout the system at which poultry products are processed for export to the United States;</P>
              <P>(B) Ultimate control and supervision by the national government over the official activities of all employees or licensees of the system;</P>
              <P>(C) The assignment of competent, qualified inspectors;</P>
              <P>(D) Authority and responsibility of national inspection officials to enforce the requisite laws and regulations governing poultry inspection and to certify or refuse to certify poultry products intended for export;</P>
              <P>(E) Adequate administrative and technical support;</P>
              <P>(F) The inspection, sanitation, quality, species verification, and residue standards applied to products produced in the United States.</P>
              <P>(G) Other requirements of adequate inspection service as required by the regulations.</P>
              <P>(ii) The legal authority for the system and the regulations thereunder shall impose requirements equivalent to those governing the system of poultry inspection organized and maintained in the United States with respect to:</P>
              <P>(A) Ante mortem inspection of poultry for slaughter, which shall be performed by veterinarians or by other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;</P>
              <P>(B) Post mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;</P>

              <P>(E) Complete separation of establishments certified under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified, and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation throughout all certified establishments;</P>
              <P>(F) Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for sanitary handling of poultry products;</P>
              <P>(G) Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;</P>
              <P>(H) A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as set forth in part 417 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(I) Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of poultry products into the United States may request a determination of eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which the foreign poultry inspection system is based and such other information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii). Determination of eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a country for importation of poultry products into the United States depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign poultry inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department, and the timely submission of such documents and other information related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system as the Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations required by this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those applicable to the Federal system in the United States, are being met. The program as implemented must provide for the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Periodic supervisory visits by a representative of the foreign inspection system to each establishment certified in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section to ensure that requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section are being met: Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States;</P>

              <P>(B) Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign inspection system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (a)(2)(ii)(H) of this section, copies of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department at the time of the representative's review upon request by that representative to a responsible foreign inspection official: <E T="03">Provided,</E> that such reports are not required during a period when the establishment is not operating or not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States.</P>

              <P>(C) Random sampling and testing at the point of slaughter of carcasses, including internal organs and fat, for residues identified by the exporting country's inspection authorities or by this Agency as potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical techniques approved by the Administrator: <E T="03">Provided,</E> that such testing is required only on samples taken of carcasses from which poultry or poultry products intended for importation into the United States are produced.</P>

              <P>(3) Only those establishments that are determined and certified to the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program representatives at times prearranged with <PRTPAGE P="473"/>the foreign meat inspection system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed annually. Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of adulterated or misbranded product.</P>
              <P>(i) For a new establishment or any establishment for which information from last year's electronic certification or paper certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name, address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title; the foreign official's signature (for paper certificates only); the type of operation(s) conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)). Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the process category).</P>

              <P>(2) Every lot of product shall routinely be given visual inspection for appearance and condition, and checked for certification and label compliance.</P>
              <P>(3) The electronic inspection system shall be consulted for reinspection instructions. The electronic inspection system will assign reinspection levels and procedures based on established sampling plans and established product and plant history.</P>
              <P>(4) When the inspector deems it necessary, the inspector may sample and inspect lots not designated by the electronic inspection system.</P>

              <P>(d) In addition to the provisions specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the following requirements apply to imported canned product.</P>

              <P>(1) Imported canned products are required to be sound, healthful, properly labeled, wholesome, and otherwise not <PRTPAGE P="475"/>adulterated at the time the products are offered for importation into the United States. Provided other requirements of this part are met, the determination of the acceptability of the product and the condition of the containers shall be based on the results of an examination of a statistical sample drawn from the consignment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. If the inspector determines, on the basis of the sample examination, that the product does not meet the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder, the consignment shall be refused entry. However, a consignment rejected for container defects but otherwise acceptable may be reoffered for inspection under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) If the defective containers are not indicative of an unsafe or unstable product as determined by the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the number and kinds of container defects found in the original sample do not exceed the limits specified for this purpose in FSIS guidelines; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the defective containers in the consignment have been sorted out and exported or destroyed under the supervision of an inspector.</P>

              <P>(2) Representative samples of canned product designated by the Administrator in instructions to inspectors shall be incubated under the supervision of such inspectors in accordance with § 381.309 (d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv)(<E T="03">c</E>), (d)(1)(v), (d)(1)(vii), and (d)(1)(viii) of this subchapter. The importer or his/her agent shall provide the necessary incubation facilities in accordance with § 381.309(d)(1)(i) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(3) Sampling plans and acceptance levels as prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section may be obtained, upon request, from International Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.</P>
              <P>(e) All products, required by this part to be inspected, shall be inspected only at an official establishment or at an official import inspection establishment approved by the Administrator as provided in this section. Such approved official import inspection establishments will be listed in the Meat, Poultry and Egg Product Inspection Directory, published by the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The listing will categorize the kind or kinds of product which may be inspected at each official import inspection establishment, based on the adequacy of the facilities for making such inspections and handling such products in a sanitary manner.</P>
              <P>(f) Owners or operators of establishments, other than official establishments, who want to have import inspections made at their establishments, shall apply to the Administrator for approval of their establishments for such purpose. Application shall be made on a form furnished by the Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, and shall include all information called for by that form.</P>
              <P>(g) Approval for Federal import inspection shall be in accordance with subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Owners or operators of establishments at which import inspections of product are to be made shall furnish adequate sanitary facilities and equipment for examination of such product. The requirements of §§ 381.21 and 381.36, and part 416 of this chapter shall apply as conditions for approval of establishments as official import inspection establishments to the same extent and in the same manner as they apply with respect to official establishments.</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator is authorized to approve any establishment as an official import inspection establishment provided that an application has been filed and drawings have been submitted in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and he determines that such establishment meets the requirements under paragraph (e) of this section. Any application for inspection under this section may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(j) Approval of an official import inspection establishment may be withdrawn in accordance with applicable rules of practice if it is determined that the sanitary conditions are such that the product is rendered adulterated, that such action is authorized by <PRTPAGE P="476"/>section 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (84 Stat. 91), or that the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section were not complied with. Approval may also be withdrawn in accordance with section 401 of the Act and applicable rules of practice.</P>
              <P>(k) A special official number shall be assigned to each official import inspection establishment. Such number shall be used to identify all products inspected and passed for entry at the establishment.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Program inspectors shall report their findings as to any product which has been inspected in accordance with this part, to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry.</P>
              <P>(2) When product has been identified as “U.S. refused entry,” the inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and immediate exportation, or an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) No lot of product which has been refused entry may be subdivided during disposition pursuant to paragraph <PRTPAGE P="477"/>(a)(2) of this section, except that removal and destruction of any damaged or otherwise unsound product from a lot destined for reexportation is permitted under supervision of USDA prior to exportation. Additionally, such refused entry lot may not be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the product came into the United States without the expressed consent of the Administrator, based on full information concerning the product's disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “lot” shall refer to that product identified on MP Form 410 in the original request for inspection for importation pursuant to § 381.198.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for “refused entry” product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.</P>
              <P>(5) If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Department will take such actions as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expenses in the appropriate forum.</P>
              <P>(6) No product which has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in accordance with section 19 of the Act, and seizure and condemnation in accordance with section 20 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to the Director any product which has been delivered to consignee under this subpart and subsequently designated “U.S. Refused Entry” or found in any request not to comply with the requirements in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in § 381.200(a) or (b), no person shall remove or cause to be removed from any place designated as the place of inspection, any poultry product which the regulations in this subpart require to be marked in any way, unless the same has been clearly and legibly marked in compliance with this subpart.</P>

              <P>(d) Any person receiving inspection service may, if dissatisfied with any decision of an inspector relating to any inspection, file an appeal from such decision: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such appeal is filed within 48 hours from the time the decision was made. Any such appeal from a decision of an inspector shall be made to his/her immediate supervisor having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal, and such supervisor shall determine whether the inspector's decision was correct. Review of such appeal determination, when requested, shall be made by the immediate supervisor of the employee of the Department making the appeal determination. The cost of any such appeal shall be borne by the appellant if the Administrator determines that the appeal is frivolous. The charges for such frivolous appeal shall be at the rate of $9.28 per hour for the time required to make the appeal inspection. The poultry or poultry products involved in any appeal shall be identified by U.S. retained tags and segregated in a manner approved by the inspector pending completion of an appeal inspection.</P>
              <P>(e) All condemned carcasses, or condemned parts of carcasses, or other condemned poultry products, except those condemned for biological residues, shall be disposed of by one of the following methods, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service. (Facilities and materials for carrying out the requirements in this section shall be furnished by the official establishments.)</P>

              <P>(1) Steam treatment (which shall be accomplished by processing the condemned product in a pressure tank under at least 40 pounds of steam pressure) or thorough cooking in a kettle <PRTPAGE P="478"/>or vat, a sufficient time to effectively destroy the product for human food purposes and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals. (Tanks and equipment used for this purpose or for rendering or preparing inedible products shall be in rooms or compartments separate from those used for the preparation of edible products. There shall be no direct connection by means of pipes, or otherwise, between tanks containing inedible products and those containing edible products.)</P>
              <P>(2) Incineration or complete destruction by burning.</P>
              <P>(3) Chemical denaturing, which shall be accomplished by the liberal application to all carcasses and parts thereof, of:</P>

              <SUBJECT>States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act; application of regulations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The provisions of the regulations in this part apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in § 381.221 under paragraph 5(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)</P>
              <P>(a) Each establishment located in such a designated State, shall be granted inspection required under § 381.6(b) only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.</P>
              <P>(b) Section 381.26 will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 381.6(b), except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments or between official establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible poultry product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of the regulations. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible poultry product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) Sections 381.49 and 381.51 shall apply to such establishments, except that separate facilities for men and women workers will not be required when the majority of the workers in the establishment are related by blood or marriage, provided that this will not conflict with municipal or State requirements; and except that separation of toilet soil lines from house drainage lines to a point outside the buildings will not be required in existing construction when positive acting backflow devices are installed.</P>
              <P>(d) Subpart N of this part shall apply to such establishments except as provided in this paragraph (d).</P>

              <P>(1) The operator of each such establishment shall, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under § 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment <PRTPAGE P="484"/>number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 4(h) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) The Front Line Supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff and will retain one copy in a temporary approval file for the establishment.</P>
              <P>(3) The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff at headquarters, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection, all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by § 412.1 or their use must be discontinued.</P>
              <P>(4) The Front Line Supervisor will also review all shipping containers to ensure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of pressure sensitive tape of a type that cannot be removed without visible evidence of such removal, or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of the regulations must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.</P>
              <P>(e) Sections 381.175 through 381.179 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 5(c) only if the State is also designated under section 11 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in § 381.224.</P>
              <P>(f) Section 381.185(a) will not apply to States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(g) Provisions of this part relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Control and disposition of nonfederally inspected poultry products in States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Upon the effective date of designation of a State under paragraph 5(c) of the Act, no poultry products can be processed within the State unless they are prepared under inspection pursuant to the regulations or are exempted from the requirement of inspection under § 381.10, and no unexempted poultry products which were processed without any inspection can lawfully be distributed within the State. For a period of 90 days from the effective date of such designation, poultry products which were processed in any State listed in § 381.187 and inspected and passed under the supervision of a responsible State or local inspection agency or exempted from State inspection can be distributed solely within the State, provided they are not adulterated or misbranded, except that the official inspection legend shall not be used. Such products may not enter official establishments. After said 90-day period, only federally inspected and passed products may be distributed within the designated State, except as provided in § 381.10.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria and procedure for designating establishments with operations which would clearly endanger the public health; disposition of poultry products therein.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An establishment in any State not listed in § 381.221 that is preparing poultry products solely for distribution within such State shall be designated as one producing adulterated products which would clearly endanger the public health, if:</P>
              <P>(1) Any poultry product processed at the establishment is adulterated in any of the following respects:</P>
              <P>(i) It bears or contains a pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive, that is “unsafe” within the meaning of section 408, 409, or 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or was intentionally subjected to radiation in a manner not permitted under section 409 of said Act; or if it bears or contains any other added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health or make it unfit for human food; or</P>
              <P>(ii) It consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food (for example, it was prepared from a poultry carcass or other ingredients exhibiting spoilage characteristics); or it is, or was prepared from, a poultry carcass which would be required to be condemned under subpart K at official establishments; or</P>
              <P>(iii) It has been prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health (for example, if insects or vermin are not effectively controlled at the establishment, or insanitary water is used in preparing poultry products for human food); or</P>
              <P>(iv) It is, in whole or in part, the product of poultry that died otherwise than by slaughter; or</P>
              <P>(v) Its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; and</P>
              <P>(2) Such adulterated articles are intended to be or are distributed from the establishment while capable of use as human food.</P>
              <P>(b) When any such establishment is identified by an inspector as one producing adulterated poultry products which would clearly endanger public health under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the following procedure will be followed:</P>

              <P>(1) The inspector will informally advise the operator of the establishment concerning the deficiencies found by him and report his findings to the appropriate Regional Director for the Inspection Service. When it is determined by the Regional Director that <PRTPAGE P="487"/>any establishment preparing poultry products solely for distribution within any State is producing adulterated poultry products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health, written notification thereof will be issued to the appropriate State officials, including the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee, for effective action under State or local law to prevent such endangering of the public health. Such written notification shall clearly specify the deficiencies deemed to result in the production of adulterated poultry products and shall specify a reasonable time for such action under State or local law.</P>
              <P>(2) If effective action is not taken under State or local law within the specified time, written notification shall be issued by the Regional Director to the operator of the establishment, specifying the deficiencies involved and allowing him 10 days to present his views or make the necessary corrections, and notifying him that failure to correct such deficiencies may result in designation of the establishment and operator thereof as subject to the provisions of sections 1 through 4, 6 through 10, and 12 through 22 of the Act as though engaged in commerce.</P>
              <P>(3) Thereafter the inspector shall survey the establishment and designate it if he determines, in consultation with the Regional Director, that it is producing adulterated poultry products, which would clearly endanger the public health, and formal notice of such designation will be issued to the operator of the establishment by the Regional Director.</P>

              <P>(c) Poultry products on hand at the time of designation of an establishment under this section are subject to retention or detention, and seizure and condemnation in accordance with § 381.145 or subpart U of this part: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That poultry products that have been federally inspected and so identified and that have not been further prepared at any nonfederally inspected establishment may be released for distribution if the products appear to be not adulterated or misbranded at the time of such release.</P>
              <P>(d) No establishment designated under this section can lawfully prepare any poultry products unless it first obtains inspection or qualifies for exemption under § 381.10 of this subpart. All other provisions of the regulations shall apply to establishments designated under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if they were engaged in commerce, except that the exceptions provided for in § 381.222 shall apply to such establishments.</P>

              <P>(a) All nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The term “serving” or “serving size” means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older, which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the product. When the product is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.</P>

              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8), (b)(12), and (b)(14) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, the serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion—General Food Supply” (Reference Amount(s)) that appear in § 381.412(b) using the procedures described in this paragraph (b). For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ___ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the Reference Amounts in § 381.412(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrition claims.<PRTPAGE P="489"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of the product “as packaged” for all products, except that single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products as described in § 381.401 may be declared on the basis of the product “as consumed.” For single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, if data are based on the product “as consumed,” the data must be presented in accordance with § 381.445(d). In addition to the required declaration on the basis of “as packaged” for products other than single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products as described in § 381.401, the declaration may also be made on the basis of “as consumed,” provided that preparation and cooking instructions are clearly stated.</P>
              <P>(4) For products in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings, and individually packaged products within a multi-serving package), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings and barbecue sauce), the serving size shall be declared as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent but less than 67 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be one unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a unit weighs 200 percent or more of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit as the serving size if the whole unit can reasonably be consumed at a single eating occasion.</P>
              <P>(v) For products that have Reference Amounts of 100 grams (or milliliter) or larger and are individual units within a multi-serving package, if a unit contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may decide whether to declare the individual unit as 1 or 2 servings.</P>
              <P>(vi) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings and barbecue sauce), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product as determined in § 381.412(c).</P>
              <P>(vii) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.</P>

              <P>(5) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza, pan of poultry lasagna), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g., <FR>1/8</FR> quiche, <FR>1/4</FR> pizza) that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category. The serving size may be the fraction of the package used to make the Reference Amount for the unprepared product determined in § 381.412(d) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount of the combined product determined in § 381.412(c). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use <FR>1/2</FR>, <FR>1/3</FR>, <FR>1/4</FR>, <FR>1/5</FR>, <FR>1/6</FR>, or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.<PRTPAGE P="490"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., whole turkey, turkey breast, ground poultry), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., turkey breast and gravy), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product determined in § 381.412(c).</P>
              <P>(7) For labeling purposes, the term “common household measure” or “common household unit” means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g., <FR>1/4</FR> pizza), ounce (oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar or tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section, the following rules shall be used:</P>
              <P>(i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate. Cups shall be expressed in <FR>1/4</FR>- or <FR>1/3</FR>-cup increments, tablespoons in whole number of tablespoons for quantities less than <FR>1/4</FR> cup but greater than or equal to 2 tablespoons (tbsp), 1, 1<FR>1/3</FR>, 1<FR>1/2</FR>, or 1<FR>2/3</FR> tbsp for quantities less than 2 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 tbsp, and teaspoons in whole number of teaspoons for quantities less than 1 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 teaspoon (tsp), and in <FR>1/4</FR>-tsp increments for quantities less than 1 tsp.</P>
              <P>(ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.</P>
              <P>(iii) If cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, or units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, or fraction are not applicable, ounces may be used. Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5-ounce increments most closely approximating the Reference Amount with rounding indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2.5 ounces).</P>
              <P>(iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single-serving containers and for individually packaged products within multi-serving containers (e.g., can, box, package, meal, or dinner). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., wing, slice, link, or patty).</P>
              <P>(v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.</P>
              <P>(vi) For products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., chicken wings with a glaze packet), the nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 grams (g).</P>
              <P>(viii) When a serving size, determined from the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes (e.g., 2.5 tbsp), manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.</P>
              <P>(8) A product that is packaged and sold individually and that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable Reference Amount shall be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product shall be labeled as one serving, except for products that have Reference Amounts of 100 g (or mL) or larger, manufacturers may decide whether a package that contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount is 1 or 2 servings. Packages sold individually that contain 200 percent or more of the applicable Reference Amount may be labeled as a single-serving if the entire content of the package can reasonably be consumed at a single-eating occasion.</P>

              <P>(9) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) <PRTPAGE P="491"/>through (b)(8) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams), except for single-serving containers.</P>
              <P>(i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to paragraph (b)(11) of this section. However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.</P>
              <P>(ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.</P>
              <P>(iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced chicken roll. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1-oz increments.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, and oz for ounce.</P>
              <P>(10) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2 servings; about 3.5 servings).</P>
              <P>(ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size, the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).</P>
              <P>(iii) For random weight products, a manufacturer may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the Reference Amount expressed in ounces. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parenthesis following the “varied” statement (e.g., varied (approximately 8 servings per pound)).</P>
              <P>(iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.</P>
              <P>(v) For packages containing several individually packaged multi-serving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number of individual multi-serving units in the total package by the number of servings in each individual unit. The declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, including those that have been previously frozen.</P>

              <P>(11) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of product as packaged or purchased with the exception of single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and products that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of products that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.<PRTPAGE P="492"/>
              </P>
              <P>(12) The serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(l) and § 381.413 (m) in single-serve containers will be the entire edible content of the package. Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers will be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 381.412(b) if the product is listed in § 381.412(b). Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers that are not listed in § 381.412(b) will be based on the reference amount according to § 381.412(c), (d), and (e).</P>
              <P>(13) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information in the same format as required by § 381.409(e),</P>
              <P>(i) Per 100 grams, 100 milliliters, or 1 ounce of the product as packaged or purchased.</P>
              <P>(ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units in a multi-serving container is more than one unit.</P>
              <P>(14) If a product consists of assortments of poultry products (e.g., variety packs) in the same package, nutrient content shall be expressed on the entire package contents or on each individual product.</P>

              <P>(15) If a product is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient contents on the basis of the product as consumed for the product alone (e.g., a cream soup mix may be labeled with one set of Daily Values for the dry mix (per serving), and another set for the serving of the final soup when prepared (e.g., per serving of cream soup mix and 1 cup of vitamin D fortified whole milk)): <E T="03">Provided,</E> that the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.</P>
              <P>(c) The declaration of nutrition information on the label or in labeling of a poultry product shall contain information about the level of the following nutrients, except for those nutrients whose inclusion, and the declaration of amounts, is voluntary as set forth in this paragraph. No nutrients or food components other than those listed in this paragraph as either mandatory or voluntary may be included within the nutrition label. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, nutrient information shall be presented using the nutrient names specified and in the following order in the formats specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) “Calories, total,” “Total calories,” or “Calories”: A statement of the caloric content per serving, expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, and 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero.

              <P>(i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product is represented or purported to be for infants or children under 4 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it shall be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the product is represented or purported to be for infants and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.</P>

              <P>(ii) The corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving for products represented or purported to be for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 in “Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” Rome, 1990, which is incorporated by reference. Sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 of the “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” as published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization, is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval.

For products represented or purported to be for infants, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject product's protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein <PRTPAGE P="497"/>value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.</P>
              <P>(iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and the RDI for protein for children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women shall be 16 grams, 14 grams, 60 grams, and 65 grams, respectively.</P>

For products represented or purported to be for use by both infants and children under 4 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants from birth to 12 months of age and for children under 4 years of age. Similarly, the percent of Daily Value based on both the RDI values for pregnant women and for lactating women shall be declared separately on products represented or purported to be for use by both pregnant and lactating women. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. All other products shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.</P>
              <P>(ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a percent of the RDI shall include vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron, in that order, and shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added, or when a claim is made about them. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or in labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:</P>
              <P>(A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another product; or</P>

              <P>(11)(i) If the space beneath the information on vitamins and minerals is not adequate to accommodate the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the information required in paragraph (d)(9) may be moved to the right of the column required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the space beneath the mandatory declaration of iron is not adequate to accommodate any remaining vitamins and minerals to be declared or the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the remaining information may be moved to the right and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information given to the left. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.</P>
              <P>(iii) If there is not sufficient continuous vertical space (i.e., approximately 3 inches) to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label up to and including the mandatory declaration of iron, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular display in which the footnote required by paragraph (d)(9) of the section is given to the far right of the label, and additional vitamins and minerals beyond the four that are required (i.e., vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) are arrayed horizontally following declarations of the required vitamins and minerals.</P>
              <P>(12) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section:</P>

              <P>(13)(i) Nutrition labeling on the outer label of packages of poultry products that contain two or more products in the same packages (e.g., variety packs) or of packages that are used interchangeably for the same type of food (e.g., poultry salad containers) may use an aggregate display.</P>

              <P>(ii) Aggregate displays shall comply with format requirements of paragraph <PRTPAGE P="502"/>(d) of this section to the maximum extent possible, except that the identity of each food shall be specified to the right of the “Nutrition Facts” title, and both the quantitative amount by weight (i.e., g/mg amounts) and the percent Daily Value for each nutrient shall be listed in separate columns under the name of each food.</P>
              <P>(14) When nutrition labeling appears in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in a separate nutrition label for each language or in one nutrition label with the information in the second language following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated (e.g., “Protein/Proteinas 2 g”). All required information must be included in both languages.</P>
              <P>(e) Nutrition information may be presented for two or more forms of the same product (e.g., both “raw” and “cooked”) or for common combinations of foods as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for different units (e.g., per 100 grams) as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for two or more groups for which RDI's are established (e.g., both infants and children less than 4 years of age) as provided for in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. When such dual labeling is provided, equal prominence shall be given to both sets of values. Information shall be presented in a format consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) Following the subheading of “Amount Per Serving,” there shall be two or more column headings accurately describing the forms of the same product (e.g., “raw” and “roasted”), the combinations of foods, the units, or the RDI groups that are being declared. The column representing the product as packaged and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) shall be to the left of the numeric columns.</P>
              <P>(2) When the dual labeling is presented for two or more forms of the same product, for combinations of foods, or for different units, total calories and calories from fat (and calories from saturated fat, when declared) shall be listed in a column and indented as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section with quantitative amounts declared in columns aligned under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Quantitative information by weight required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section shall be specified for the form of the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b).</P>
              <P>(i) Quantitative information by weight may be included for other forms of the product represented by the additional column(s) either immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information by weight for the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) or as a footnote.</P>
              <P>(A) If such additional quantitative information is given immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information, it shall be declared for all nutrients listed and placed immediately following and differentiated from the required quantitative information (e.g., separated by a comma). Such information shall not be put in a separate column.</P>

              <P>(B) If such additional quantitative information is given in a footnote, it shall be declared in the same order as the nutrients are listed in the nutrition label. The additional quantitative information may state the total nutrient content of the product identified in the second column or the nutrient amounts added to the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, for only those nutrients that are present in different amounts than the amounts declared in the required quantitative information. The footnote shall clearly identify which <PRTPAGE P="503"/>amounts are declared. Any subcomponents declared shall be listed parenthetically after principal components (e.g., <FR>1/2</FR> cup skim milk contributes an additional 40 calories, 65 mg sodium, 6 g total carbohydrate (6 g sugars), and 4 g protein).</P>
              <P>(ii) Total fat and its quantitative amount by weight shall be followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) (e.g., “Total fat (2 g)*”) referring to another asterisk (or symbol) at the bottom of the nutrition label identifying the form(s) of the product for which quantitative information is presented.</P>
              <P>(4) Information required in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii) and (d)(8) of this section shall be presented under the subheading “% DAILY VALUE” and in columns directly under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:</P>

              </GPH>

              <P>(f)(1) Nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as set forth herein when any required nutrients, other than the core nutrients (i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, and protein), are present in insignificant amounts. An insignificant amount shall be defined as that <PRTPAGE P="505"/>amount that may be rounded to zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars and protein, it shall be an amount less than 1 gram.</P>
              <P>(2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:</P>
              <P>(i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, sodium, and protein;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any of the following that are present in more than insignificant amounts: Calories from fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, sugars, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added in fortified or fabricated foods.</P>
              <P>(3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the product in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.</P>
              <P>(4) Any required nutrient, other than a core nutrient, that is present in an insignificant amount may be omitted from the tabular listing, provided that the following statement is included at the bottom of the nutrition label, “Not a significant source of ____.” The blank shall be filled in with the appropriate nutrient or food component. Alternatively, amounts of vitamins and minerals present in insignificant amounts may be declared by the use of an asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).”</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section and in § 381.500(c) and (d), nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required. When the footnote is omitted, an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”</P>
              <P>(g) Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section and § 381.402(a) by one or more of the following means:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or linear (i.e., string) fashion, rather than in vertical columns if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion only if the package shape or size will not accommodate a tabular display.</P>
              <P>(ii) When nutrition information is given in a linear display, the nutrition information shall be set off in a box by the use of a hairline. The percent Daily Value is separated from the quantitative amount declaration by the use of parenthesis, and all nutrients, both principal components and subcomponents, are treated similarly. Bolding is required only on the title “Nutrition Facts” and is allowed for nutrient names for “Calories,” “Total fat,” “Cholesterol,” “Sodium,” “Total carbohydrate,” and “Protein.”</P>

              <P>(h) Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A production lot is a set of food production consumer units that are from one production shift. Alternatively, a collection of consumer units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, constitutes a production lot.</P>

              <P>(2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each from a production lot. Alternatively, the sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each randomly chosen to be representative of a production lot. In each case, the units may be individually analyzed and the results of the analyses averaged, or the units would be composited and the composite analyzed. In both cases, the results, whether an average or a single result from a composite, will be considered by the Agency to be the nutrient content of a composite. All analyses shall be performed by appropriate methods and procedures used by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the “Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,” or, if no USDA method is available and appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in accordance with the 1990 edition of the “Official Methods of Analysis” of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15th ed., which is incorporated by reference, unless a particular method of analysis is specified in § 381.409(c), or, if no USDA, AOAC, or specified method is available and appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures as so determined by the Agency. The “Official Methods of Analysis” is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              <P>(3) Two classes of nutrients are defined for purposes of compliance:</P>
              <P>(i) Class I. Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. If any ingredient which contains a naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrient is added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food product is subject to Class II requirements unless the same nutrient is also added, which would make the total amount of such nutrient subject to Class I requirements.</P>

              <P>(i) Class I vitamin, mineral, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.</P>

              <P>(ii) Class II vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls below this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.</P>

              <P>(5) A product with a label declaration of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 4(h) of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)) if the nutrient content of the composite is greater <PRTPAGE P="507"/>than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls above this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.</P>
              <P>(6) The amount of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium may vary over labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice. The amount of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium may vary under labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The general principles followed in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (Reference Amount(s)), as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are:</P>
              <P>(1) The Reference Amounts are calculated for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.</P>
              <P>(2) The Reference Amounts are calculated for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such Reference Amounts are to be used only when the product is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.</P>
              <P>(3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.</P>
              <P>(4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion were considered.</P>
              <P>(5) When survey data were insufficient, FSIS took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:</P>
              <P>(i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;</P>
              <P>(iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.<PRTPAGE P="508"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the Reference Amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.</P>
              <P>(7) The Reference Amount is based on the major intended use of the product (e.g., a mixed dish measurable with a cup as a main dish and not as a side dish).</P>
              <P>(8) The Reference Amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other products, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., ground poultry), are based on use in the form purchased.</P>
              <P>(9) FSIS sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform Reference Amount.</P>
              <P>(b) The following Product Categories and Reference Amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:</P>

              <P>(2) For products where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is one or more discrete units, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be either the number of small discrete units or the fraction of the large discrete unit that is represented as the main ingredient that is closest to the Reference Amount for that ingredient as established in paragraph (b) of this section plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Reference Amounts are in compatible units, they shall be summed (e.g., ingredients in equal volumes such as tablespoons). If the Reference Amounts are in incompatible units, the weights of the appropriate volumes should be used (e.g., grams of one ingredient plus gram weight of tablespoons of a second ingredient).</P>
              <P>(d) If a product requires further preparation, e.g., cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a Reference Amount for the product in the prepared form, then the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be determined using the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare one large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the fraction of the large discrete unit closest to the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(e) The Reference Amount for an imitation or substitute product or altered product as defined in § 381.413(d), such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the <PRTPAGE P="510"/>same as for the product for which it is offered as a substitute.</P>
              <P>(f) The Reference Amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutritional claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the Reference Amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the Reference Amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the Reference Amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parenthesis, by the amount in common household measure if the Reference Amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures.</P>
              <P>(g) The Administrator, on his or her own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a labeling application, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a Product Category or Reference Amount identified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Labeling applications and supporting documentation to be filed under this section shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer disc copy. If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application shall state the applicant's post office address.</P>
              <P>(2) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information submitted to and retained in the files of the Food Safety and Inspection Service. However, any reference to unpublished information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or part be subject to release to the public) in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.</P>
              <P>(3) The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.</P>
              <P>(4) Data accompanying the labeling application, such as food consumption data, shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified. If such data has already been submitted with an earlier labeling application from the applicant, the present labeling application must provide the data.</P>
              <P>(5) The labeling application must be signed by the applicant or by his or her attorney or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.</P>
              <P>(6) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application, that to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her pertinent to the evaluation of the labeling application.</P>

              <P>(7) Labeling applications for a new Reference Amount and/or Product Category shall be accompanied by the following data which shall be submitted in the following form to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Washington, DC 20250:

                <P>The undersigned, ______ submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 381.412 with respect to Reference Amount and/or Product Category.</P>
                <P>Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:</P>
                <P>(i) A statement of the objective of the labeling application;</P>
                <P>(ii) A description of the product;</P>
                <P>(iii) A complete sample product label including nutrition label, using the format established by regulation;</P>
                <P>(iv) A description of the form in which the product will be marketed;</P>
                <P>(v) The intended dietary uses of the product with the major use identified (e.g., turkey as a luncheon meat);</P>

                <P>(vi) If the intended use is primarily as an ingredient in other foods, list of foods or food categories in which the product will be used as an ingredient with information on the prioritization of the use;<PRTPAGE P="511"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vii) The population group for which the product will be offered for use (e.g., infants, children under 4 years of age);</P>
                <P>(viii) The names of the most closely-related products (or in the case of foods for special dietary use and imitation or substitute foods, the names of the products for which they are offered as substitutes);</P>
                <P>(ix) The suggested Reference Amount (the amount of edible portion of food as consumed, excluding bone, skin or other inedible components) for the population group for which the product is intended with full description of the methodology and procedures that were used to determine the suggested Reference Amount. In determining the Reference Amount, general principles and factors in paragraph (a) of this section should be followed.</P>
                <P>(x) The suggested Reference Amount shall be expressed in metric units. Reference Amounts for foods shall be expressed in grams except when common household units such as cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons are more appropriate or are more likely to promote uniformity in serving sizes declared on product labels. For example, common household measures would be more appropriate if products within the same category differ substantially in density such as mixed dishes measurable with a cup.</P>
                <P>(A) In expressing the Reference Amount in grams, the following general rules shall be followed:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For quantities greater than 10 grams, the quantity shall be expressed in nearest 5 grams increment.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For quantities less than 10 grams, exact gram weights shall be used.</P>
                <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(xi) A labeling application for a new subcategory of food with its own Reference Amount shall include the following additional information:</P>
                <P>(A) Data that demonstrate that the new subcategory of food will be consumed in amounts that differ enough from the Reference Amount for the parent category to warrant a separate Reference Amount. Data must include sample size, and the mean, standard deviation, median, and modal consumed amount per eating occasion for the product identified in the labeling application and for other products in the category. All data must be derived from the same survey data.</P>
                <P>(B) Documentation supporting the difference in dietary usage and product characteristics that affect the consumption size that distinguishes the product identified in the labeling application from the rest of the products in the category.</P>
                <P>(xii) In conducting research to collect or process food consumption data in support of the labeling application, the following general guidelines should be followed.</P>
                <P>(A) Sampled population selected should be representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the target population group for which the food is intended.</P>
                <P>(B) Sample size (i.e., number of eaters) should be large enough to give reliable estimates for customarily consumed amounts.</P>
                <P>(C) The study protocol should identify potential biases and describe how potential biases are controlled for or, if not possible to control, how they affect interpretation of results.</P>
                <P>(D) The methodology used to collect or process data including study design, sampling procedures, materials used (e.g., questionnaire, interviewer's manual), procedures used to collect or process data, methods or procedures used to control for unbiased estimates, and procedures used to correct for nonresponse, should be fully documented.</P>

                <P>(xiii) A statement concerning the feasibility of convening associations, corporations, consumers, and other interested parties to engage in negotiated rulemaking to develop a proposed rule.

              <SECTNO>§ 381.413</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Nutrient content claims; general principles.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to poultry products that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale.</P>
              <P>(b) A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in nutrition labeling pursuant to § 381.409, may not be made on a label or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the product, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”</P>
              <P>(2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:</P>
              <P>(i) Describes the product or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Suggests that the product, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).</P>
              <P>(3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on products intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in subpart Y of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in applicable provisions in this subpart and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).</P>
              <P>(c) Information that is required or permitted by § 381.409 to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.</P>
              <P>(d) A “substitute” product is one that may be used interchangeably with another product that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”</P>
              <P>(1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the product, the product may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).</P>
              <P>(2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a product implies that the product differs from other products of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only products that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the product, remove the nutrient from the product, or not include the nutrient in the product, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium chicken noodle soup”).</P>

              <P>(2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a product, or that a product is low in a nutrient when the product has not been specially processed, altered, <PRTPAGE P="514"/>formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the product inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all products of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “chicken breast meat, a low sodium food”).</P>
              <P>(f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size and style no larger than two times that of the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.</P>
              <P>(g) Labeling information required in §§ 381.413, 381.454, 381.456, 381.460, 381.461, 381.462, and 381.480, whose type size is not otherwise specified, is required to be in letters and/or numbers no less than <FR>1/16</FR> inch in height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(h) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in § 381.409 or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart Y of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 10 g of fat per serving;”</P>
              <P>(2) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the product is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 milligrams (mg) sodium per serving, not a low sodium product.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than required by § 381.121(c) for the net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2);</P>
              <P>(3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the product and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.</P>
              <P>(4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 381.462(b)(6).</P>
              <P>(j) A product may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the product with the level of a nutrient in a reference product. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.</P>
              <P>(1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the product must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference product as specified in this paragraph (j).</P>
              <P>(i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference product may be a dissimilar product within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet or a similar product.</P>
              <P>(B) For “light,” “reduced,” and “added” claims, the reference product shall be a similar product, and</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference product shall be representative of the type of product that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference product shall be representative of a broad base of products of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the product type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.</P>

              <P>(B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference product may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a <PRTPAGE P="515"/>substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name, provided the name of the competitor is not used on the labeling of the product. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting labeling is internally consistent (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information, and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the product has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) For products bearing relative claims:</P>
              <P>(i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference product by which the nutrient has been modified, (e.g., “50 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” or “<FR>1/3</FR> fewer calories than ‘reference product’ ”); and</P>
              <P>(ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim, but no smaller than <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:</P>
              <P>(A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;</P>
              <P>(B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;</P>
              <P>(C) A claim on the information panel; or</P>
              <P>(D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.</P>
              <P>(iv) The label or labeling must also bear:</P>
              <P>(A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that in the reference product; and</P>
              <P>(B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.</P>
              <P>(3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient.</P>
              <P>(k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a product that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “modified fat ‘product’ ”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “contains 35 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.</P>
              <P>(l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal-type” product will be defined as a product that:</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under § 381.500. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Nutrition information on single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, may be provided at their point-of-purchase in accordance with the provisions of this section or on their label, in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409.</P>
              <P>(3) A retailer may provide nutrition information at the point-of-purchase by various methods, such as by posting a sign or by making the information readily available in brochures, notebooks, or leaflet form in close proximity to the food. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media. If a nutrition claim is made on point-of-purchase materials, all of the format and content requirements of § 381.409 apply. However, if only nutrition information—and not a nutrition claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase materials, the requirements of § 381.409 apply, provided, however:</P>
              <P>(i) The listing of percent of Daily Value for the nutrients (except vitamins and minerals specified in § 381.409(c)(8)) and footnote required by § 381.409(d)(9) may be omitted; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The point-of-purchase materials are not subject to any of the format requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) For the point-of-purchase materials, the declaration of nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as specified in § 381.409(f).</P>
              <P>(d) The nutrition label data for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be based on either raw or cooked edible portions of poultry cuts with skin. If data are based on cooked portions, the methods used to cook the products must be specified and for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be those which do not add nutrients from other ingredients such as flour, breading, and salt. Additional nutritional data may be presented on an optional basis for the raw or cooked edible portions of the skinless poultry meat.</P>

              <P>(e) Nutrient data that are the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, may be used for nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen. These data may be composite data that reflect different classes of turkey or other variables affecting nutrient content. Alternatively, data that reflect specific classes or other variables may be used, except that if data are used on labels attached to a product which is labeled as to class of poultry or other variables, the data must represent the product in the package when such data are contained in the representative <PRTPAGE P="518"/>data base. When data are used on labels attached to a product, the data must represent the edible poultry tissues present in the package.</P>
              <P>(f) If the nutrition information is provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a nutrition label or labeling will not be subject to the Agency compliance review under § 381.409(h), unless a nutrition claim is made on the basis of the representative data base values.</P>
              <P>(g) Retailers may use data bases that they believe reflect the nutrient content of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen; however, such labeling shall be subject to the compliance procedures of paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements specified in this subpart for the mandatory nutrition labeling program.</P>

              <P>(3) The terms “light” or “lite” may be used in the brand name of a product to describe the sodium content, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The product is reduced by 50 percent or more in sodium content compared to the reference product;</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement specifically stating that the product is “light in sodium” or “lite in sodium” appears:</P>
              <P>(A) Contiguous to the brand name; and</P>
              <P>(B) In uniform type size, style, color, and prominence as the product name; and</P>
              <P>(iii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>
              <P>(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium was reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim; and</P>

              <P>(1) It describes some physical or organoleptic attribute of the product such as texture or color and the information (e.g., “light in color” or “light in texture”) so stated, clearly conveys the nature of the product; and</P>
              <P>(2) The attribute (e.g., “color” or “texture”) is in the same style, color, and at least one-half the type size as the word “light” and in immediate proximity thereto.</P>
              <P>(f) If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the word “light” has been associated, through common use, with a particular product to reflect a physical or organoleptic attribute to the point where it has become part of the statement of identity, such use of the term “light” shall not be considered a nutrient content claim subject to the requirements in this part.</P>
              <P>(g) The term “lightly salted” may be used on a product to which has been added 50 percent less sodium than is normally added to the reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1)(i)(B) and (j)(1)(ii)(B), provided that if the product is not “low in sodium” as defined in § 381.461(b)(4), the statement “not a low sodium food,” shall appear adjacent to the nutrition information and the information required to accompany a relative claim shall appear on the label or labeling as specified in § 381.413(j)(2).</P>

Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such terms unless:</P>

              <P>(ii) The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: “Adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie product,” “not a low calorie product,” or “not for weight control.”</P>
              <P>(2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:</P>
              <P>(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 381.409(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging;</P>
              <P>(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice;</P>
              <P>(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a product, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results;</P>
              <P>(iv) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and</P>
              <P>(v) The product bears a statement that the product is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the product meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” product) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.</P>
              <P>(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product, including products intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.</P>
              <P>(4) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar,” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 318.413(m), provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and</P>

              <P>(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate <PRTPAGE P="524"/>proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “this product contains 25 percent less sugar than our regular product”); and</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving”).</P>
              <P>(5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and</P>

                <P>The undersigned, ______ submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 381.469 with respect to (statement of the claim and its proposed use).</P>
                <P>Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:</P>

                <P>(i) A statement identifying the nutrient content claim and the nutrient that the term is intended to characterize with respect to the level of such nutrient. The statement shall address why the use of the term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement <PRTPAGE P="534"/>shall provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of products on which the claim will be used. The statement shall also specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the product must be met for the appropriate use of the term in labels or labeling, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.</P>
                <P>(ii) A detailed explanation supported by any necessary data of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and scientific data sufficient for such purpose, and data and information to the extent necessary to demonstrate that consumers can be expected to understand the meaning of the term under the proposed conditions of use.</P>
                <P>(iii) Analytical data that demonstrates the amount of the nutrient that is present in the products for which the claim is intended. The assays should be performed on representative samples in accordance with 381.409(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the nutrient in the particular food. The validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.</P>

                <P>(iv) A detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption, and any corresponding changes in nutrient intake. The analysis shall specifically address the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the above analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group.

              <P>(1) Nutrition labeling in conformity with § 381.409 of this subpart, unless exempt under that section, and</P>
              <P>(2) A conspicuous statement of the basis upon which the product claims to be of special dietary usefulness.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonnutritive ingredients.</E> (1) Any product subject to paragraph (a) of this section that achieves its special dietary usefulness by use of a nonnutritive ingredient (i.e., one not utilized in normal metabolism) shall bear on its label a statement that it contains a nonnutritive ingredient and the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive ingredient.</P>
              <P>(2) A special dietary product may contain a nonnutritive sweetener or other ingredient only if the ingredient is safe for use in the product under the applicable law and regulations of this chapter. Any product that achieves its special dietary usefulness in reducing or maintaining body weight through the use of a nonnutritive sweetener shall bear on its label the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not state the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive sweetener. If a nutritive sweetener(s) as well as nonnutritive sweetener(s) is added, the statement shall indicate the presence of both types of sweetener; e.g., “Sweetened with nutritive sweetener(s) and nonnutritive sweetener(s).”</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">“Label terms suggesting usefulness as low calorie or reduced calorie foods”.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, a product may be labeled with terms such as “diet,” “dietetic,” “artificially sweetened,” or “sweetened with nonnutritive sweetener” only if the claim is not false or misleading, and the product is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears another comparative calorie claim in compliance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms that is specifically authorized by regulation governing a particular food, or, unless otherwise restricted by regulation, to any use of the term “diet” that clearly shows that the product is offered solely for a dietary use other than regulating body weight, e.g., “for low sodium diets.”</P>

              <P>(3) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms on a formulated meal replacement or other product that is represented to be of special dietary use as a whole meal, pending the issuance of a <PRTPAGE P="539"/>regulation governing the use of such terms on foods.</P>

              <P>(ii) Multi-ingredient products (e.g. sausage) processed at a retail store or similar retail-type establishment, provided, however, that this exemption does not apply to multi-ingredient ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 that are processed at a retail establishment, unless the establishment qualifies for an exemption under (a)(1); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Products that are ground or chopped at an individual customer's request.</P>

              <P>(b) Restaurant menus generally do not constitute labeling or fall within the scope of these regulations.<PRTPAGE P="540"/>

              <P>(v) Such labeling shall not include the footnote specified in § 381.409(d)(9).</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Products in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are exempt from nutrition labeling, provided that the labeling for these products bear no nutrition claims or other nutrition information except that this exemption does not apply to the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444. The manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall provide, on the label of packages that qualify for and use this exemption, an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (e.g., “For nutrition information call 1-800-123-4567”).</P>
              <P>(2) When such products bear nutrition labeling, either voluntarily or because nutrition claims or other nutrition information is provided, all required information shall be in a type size no smaller than 6 point or all upper case type of <FR>1/16</FR>-inch minimum height, except that individual serving-size packages of poultry products that have a total area available to bear labeling of 3 square inches or less may provide all required information in a type size no smaller than <FR>1/32</FR>-inch minimum height.</P>

              <P>(b) To request an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program under this subpart, a State must submit a written request to the Administrator through the FSIS District Office for the FSIS District in which the State is located. In the request the State must:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify establishments in the State that have requested to be selected for the program that the State recommends for initial selection into the program, if any;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the State is able to provide the necessary inspection services to selected establishments in the State and conduct any related activities that would be required under a cooperative interstate shipment program established under this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(3) Agree that, if the State enters into an agreement with FSIS for a cooperative interstate shipment program, the State will:</P>
              <P>(i) Provide FSIS with access to the results of all laboratory analyses conducted on product samples from selected establishments in the State;</P>
              <P>(ii) Notify the selected establishment coordinator for the State of the results of any laboratory analyses that indicate that a product prepared in a selected establishment may be adulterated or may otherwise present a food safety concern; and</P>

              <P>(c) If an establishment is selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the State is to assign the establishment an official number that reflects the establishment's participation in the cooperative interstate shipment program and advise the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State of the official number assigned to each selected establishment in the State. The official numbers assigned to every selected establishment must contain a suffix, e.g., “SE,” that identifies the establishment as a selected establishment; that includes the letter “P,” which identifies <PRTPAGE P="543"/>the establishment as a poultry establishment; and that identifies the State, e.g., “SEPND,” for “selected establishment poultry North Dakota.”</P>
              <P>(d) Failure of a State to comply with paragraph (c) of this section will disqualify the State from participation in the cooperative interstate shipment program.</P>

              <P>(a) The FSIS selected establishment coordinator for a State that has entered into an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program will visit each selected establishment in the State on a regular basis to verify that the establishment is operating in a manner that is consistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The frequency with which the SEC will visit selected establishments under the SEC's jurisdiction will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the operations conducted at the selected establishment, the establishment's schedule of operations, and the establishment's performance under the cooperative interstate shipment program. If necessary, the selected establishment coordinator, in consultation with the District Manager that covers the State, may designate qualified FSIS personnel to visit a selected establishment on behalf of the selected establishment coordinator.</P>
              <P>(b) The selected establishment coordinator, in coordination with the State, will verify that selected establishments in the State are receiving the necessary inspection services from designated personnel, and that these establishments are eligible, and remain eligible, to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program. The selected establishment coordinator's verification activities may include:</P>
              <P>(1) Verifying that each selected establishment employs, and continues to employ, 25 or fewer employees, on average, as required under § 381.513(a) of this part, unless the establishment is transitioning to become an official establishment;</P>
              <P>(2) Verifying that the designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter;</P>
              <P>(3) Verifying that that the State staffing levels for each selected establishments are appropriate to carry out the required inspection activities; and</P>
              <P>(4) Assessing each selected establishment's compliance with the Act and implementing regulations in this chapter.</P>

              <P>(c) If the selected establishment coordinator determines that designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in the State in a manner that is inconsistent with the Acts and the implementing regulations in this chapter, the Administrator will provide an opportunity for the State to develop and implement a corrective action plan to address inspection deficiencies identified by the selected establishment coordinator. If the State fails to develop a corrective action plan, or the selected establishment coordinator for <PRTPAGE P="544"/>the State determines that the corrective action plan is inadequate, the Administrator will terminate the agreement for the cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 381.187(d) of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Enforcement authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To facilitate oversight and enforcement of this subpart, selected establishments operating under a cooperative interstate shipment program must, upon request, give the FSIS selected establishment coordinator or other FSIS officials access to all establishment records required under the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The Administrator may deselect any selected establishment that refuses to comply with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) Selected establishment coordinators may initiate any appropriate enforcement action provided for in part 500 of this chapter if they determine that a selected establishment under their jurisdiction is operating in manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. Selected establishments participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program are subject to the notification and appeal procedures set out in part 500 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) If inspection at a selected establishment is suspended for any of the reasons specified in § 500.3 or § 500.4 of this chapter, FSIS will:</P>

              <P>(d) The decision to deselect a selected establishment under a suspension will be made on a case-by-case basis. In making this decision, FSIS, in consultation with the State where the selected establishment is located, will consider, among other factors:</P>
              <P>(1) The non-compliance that led to the suspension;</P>
              <P>(2) The selected establishment's compliance history; and</P>
              <P>(3) The corrective actions proposed by the selected establishment.</P>

              <P>(a) If an establishment is deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 381.520 of this subpart, FSIS, in coordination with the State where the establishment is located, will develop and implement a plan to transition the establishment to become an official establishment. Except that an establishment that was deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program because it is located in a State whose agreement for such a program was terminated may either transition to become an official <PRTPAGE P="545"/>establishment or transition to become a State-inspected establishment under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program.</P>
              <P>(b) An establishment that has been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program and successfully transitioned to become an official establishment may withdraw from the Federal inspection program and resume operations under the cooperative State poultry products inspection program after operating as an official establishment in full compliance with the Act for a year.</P>

The availability of records, including electronic records created on or after November 1, 1996, of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and the procedures by which the public may request such information, will be governed by the FOIA and by the Department regulations as implemented and supplemented by the regulations in this part.</P>

            <P>FSIS rules and regulations relating to its regulatory responsibilities and administrative procedures are published and made available to the public in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and codified in chapter III, title 9, of the Code of Federal Regulations. FSIS also issues numerous publications relating to Agency programs, which implement the laws listed in the Delegation of Authority, 7 CFR 2.15(a). Most of these publications are available free from the USDA Publications Division, Office of Governmental and Public Affairs, or at established rates from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, 20402-9328.</P>

            <P>(a) Pursuant to the regulations in 7 CFR 1.4(c), FSIS will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying an index providing identifying information regarding the materials required to be published or made available under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)). The Agency will make the index available by computer telecommunications by December 31, 1999. Quarterly publication of the index is unnecessary and impractical, since the material is voluminous and does not change often enough to justify the expense of quarterly publication. The Agency will provide copies of any index, upon request, at a cost not to exceed direct cost of duplication.</P>
            <P>(b) FSIS is responsible for preparing reference material or a guide for requesting records or information from the Agency. This guide also will include an index of all major information systems and a description of major information and record locator systems.</P>
            <P>(c) FSIS will prepare a handbook for obtaining information from the Agency. The handbook will be available on paper and through electronic means, and will discuss how the public can use it to access Agency FOIA annual reports. Similarly, the annual reports will refer to the handbook and how to obtain it.</P>

Therefore, unless the disclosable and nondisclosable portions are so inextricably linked that it is not reasonably possible to separate them, the document will be released with the nondisclosable portions deleted. The Coordinator or designee may exercise discretion as limited by 7 CFR l.15 to release the entire document or make only a minimum number of deletions. If portions of a document in electronic format have been redacted, the Agency must indicate, on the released portion of the document, the amount of information that has been deleted from a record, unless that indication would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.</P>

            <P>(a) For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the basetime rate for inspection services, per hour per program employee, provided pursuant to §§ 350.7, 351.8, 351.9, 352.5, 354.101, 355.12, and 362.5 of this chapter, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate.<PRTPAGE P="549"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) FSIS will calculate the benefits, travel and operating, overhead, and allowance for bad debt rate components of the basetime rate, using the following formulas:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's direct benefits costs by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday), plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan basic and matching contributions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Travel and operating rate.</E> The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's total direct travel and operating costs by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday), plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of inflation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Overhead rate.</E> The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's indirect costs plus the previous fiscal year's information technology (IT) costs in the Public Health Data Communication Infrastructure System Fund plus the previous fiscal year's Office of Management Program cost in the Reimbursable and Voluntary Funds plus the provision for the operating balance less any Greenbook costs (i.e., costs of USDA support services prorated to the service component for which the fees are charged) that are not related to food inspection, by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked across all funds, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of inflation.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Previous fiscal year's allowance for bad debt (for example, debt owed that is not paid in full by plants and establishments that declare bankruptcy) divided by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
            <P>(c) The calendar year's cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Label approval.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) No final label may be used on any product unless the label has been submitted for approval to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff, accompanied by FSIS Form 7234-1, Application for Approval of Labels, Marking, and Devices, and approved by such staff, except for generically approved labels authorized for use in § 412.2. The management of the official establishment or establishment certified under a foreign inspection system, in accordance with parts 327 and 381, subpart T, must maintain a copy of all labels used, in accordance with parts 320 and 381, subpart Q, of this chapter. Such records must be made available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary upon request.</P>
            <P>(b) All labels required to be submitted for approval as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section will be submitted to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff. A parent company for a corporation may submit only one label application for a product produced in other establishments that are owned by the corporation.</P>
            <P>(c) The Food Safety and Inspection Service requires the submission of labeling applications for the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Sketch labels as defined in paragraph (d) of this section for products which are produced under a religious exemption;</P>
            <P>(2) Sketch labels for products for foreign commerce whose labels deviate from FSIS regulations, with the exception of printing labels in foreign language or printing labels that bear a statement of the quantity of contents in accordance with the usage of the country to which exported as described in § 317.7 and part 381, subpart M of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) Special statements and claims as defined in paragraph (e) of this section and presented in the context of a final label.</P>
            <P>(4) Requests for the temporary use of final labels as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) A “sketch” label is the concept of a label. It may be a printer's proof or equivalent that is sufficiently legible to clearly show all labeling features, size, and location. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will accept sketches that are hand drawn or computer generated, or other reasonable facsimiles that clearly reflect and project the final version of the label.</P>

            <P>(e) “Special statements and claims” are claims, logos, trademarks, and other symbols on labels that are not defined in the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations or the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, (except for “natural” and negative claims (e.g., “gluten free”)), health claims, ingredient and processing method claims (e.g., high-pressure processing), structure-function claims, claims regarding the raising of animals, organic claims, and instructional or disclaimer statements concerning pathogens (e.g., “for cooking only” or “not tested for <E T="03">E. coli</E> O157:H7”). Examples of logos and symbols include graphic representations of hearts and geographic landmarks. Special statements and claims do not include allergen statements (e.g., “contains soy”) applied in accordance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act.</P>

            <P>(f)(1) Temporary approval for the use of a final label that may be deemed deficient in some particular may be granted by the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff. Temporary approvals may be granted for a period not to exceed 180 calendar days, under the following conditions:<PRTPAGE P="554"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The proposed label would not misrepresent the product;</P>
            <P>(ii) The use of the label would not present any potential health, safety, or dietary problems to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(iii) Denial of the request would create undue economic hardship; and</P>
            <P>(iv) An unfair competitive advantage would not result from the granting of the temporary approval.</P>
            <P>(2) Extensions of temporary approvals may also be granted by the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff provided that the applicant demonstrates that new circumstances, meeting the above criteria, have developed since the original temporary approval was granted.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 412.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Approval of generic labels.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) An official establishment, or an establishment certified under a foreign inspection system in accordance with part 327, or part 381, subpart T of this chapter, is authorized to use generically approved labels, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, and thus is free to use such labels without submitting them to the Food Safety and Inspection Service for approval, provided the label, in accordance with this section, displays all mandatory features in a prominent manner in compliance with part 317 or part 381, and is not otherwise false or misleading in any particular.</P>
            <P>(2) The Food Safety and Inspection Service will select samples of generically approved labels from the records maintained by official establishments and establishments certified under foreign inspection systems, in accordance with part 327 or part 381, subpart T, to determine compliance with label requirements. If the Agency finds that an establishment is using a false or misleading label, it will institute the proceedings prescribed in § 500.8 of this chapter to revoke the approval for the label.</P>
            <P>(b) Generically approved labels are labels that bear all applicable mandatory labeling features (i.e., product name, safe handling statement, ingredients statement, the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor, net weight, legend, safe handling instructions, and nutrition labeling) in accordance with Federal regulations. Labels that bear claims and statements that are defined in FSIS's regulations or the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book (except for natural and negative claims), such as a statement that characterizes a product's nutrient content, such as “low fat,” has geographical significance, such as “German Brand,” or makes a country of origin statement on the label of any meat or poultry product “covered commodity”,<SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> and that comply with those regulations are also deemed to be generically approved by the Agency without being submitted for evaluation and approval. Allergen statements (e.g., “contains soy”) applied in accordance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act are also deemed generically approved.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Hazard analysis.</E> (1) Every official establishment shall conduct, or have conducted for it, a hazard analysis to determine the food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in the production process and identify the preventive measures the establishment can apply to control those hazards. The hazard analysis shall include food safety hazards that can occur before, during, and after entry into the establishment. A food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to occur is one for which a prudent establishment would establish controls because it historically has occurred, or because there is a reasonable possibility that it will occur in the particular type of product being processed, in the absence of those controls.</P>
            <P>(2) A flow chart describing the steps of each process and product flow in the establishment shall be prepared, and the intended use or consumers of the finished product shall be identified.</P>
            <P>(3) Food safety hazards might be expected to arise from the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Natural toxins;</P>
            <P>(ii) Microbiological contamination;</P>

            <P>(x) Physical hazards.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">The HACCP plan.</E> (1) Every establishment shall develop and implement a written HACCP plan covering each product produced by that establishment whenever a hazard analysis reveals one or more food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, based on the hazard analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, including products in the following processing categories:</P>
            <P>(i) Slaughter—all species.</P>
            <P>(ii) Raw product—ground.</P>
            <P>(iii) Raw product—not ground.</P>
            <P>(iv) Thermally processed—commercially sterile.</P>
            <P>(v) Not heat treated—shelf stable.</P>
            <P>(vi) Heat treated—shelf stable.</P>

            <P>(4) No product that is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation enters commerce.</P>

            <P>(b) If a deviation not covered by a specified corrective action occurs, or if <PRTPAGE P="561"/>another unforeseen hazard arises, the establishment shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Segregate and hold the affected product, at least until the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section are met;</P>
            <P>(2) Perform a review to determine the acceptability of the affected product for distribution;</P>
            <P>(3) Take action, when necessary, with respect to the affected product to ensure that no product that is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated, as a result of the deviation, enters commerce;</P>
            <P>(4) Perform or obtain reassessment by an individual trained in accordance with § 417.7 of this part, to determine whether the newly identified deviation or other unforeseen hazard should be incorporated into the HACCP plan.</P>
            <P>(c) All corrective actions taken in accordance with this section shall be documented in records that are subject to verification in accordance with § 417.4(a)(2)(iii) and the recordkeeping requirements of § 417.5 of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Validation, Verification, Reassessment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Every establishment shall validate the HACCP plan's adequacy in controlling the food safety hazards identified during the hazard analysis, and shall verify that the plan is being effectively implemented.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Initial validation.</E> Upon completion of the hazard analysis and development of the HACCP plan, the establishment shall conduct activities designed to determine that the HACCP plan is functioning as intended. During this HACCP plan validation period, the establishment shall repeatedly test the adequacy of the CCP's, critical limits, monitoring and recordkeeping procedures, and corrective actions set forth in the HACCP plan. Validation also encompasses reviews of the records themselves, routinely generated by the HACCP system, in the context of other validation activities.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ongoing verification activities.</E> Ongoing verification activities include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) The calibration of process-monitoring instruments;</P>
            <P>(ii) Direct observations of monitoring activities and corrective actions; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The review of records generated and maintained in accordance with § 417.5(a)(3) of this part.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">Reassessment of the HACCP plan.</E> Every establishment shall reassess the adequacy of the HACCP plan at least annually and whenever any changes occur that could affect the hazard analysis or alter the HACCP plan. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes in: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; slaughter or processing methods or systems; production volume; personnel; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or, the intended use or consumers of the finished product. The reassessment shall be performed by an individual trained in accordance with § 417.7 of this part. The HACCP plan shall be modified immediately whenever a reassessment reveals that the plan no longer meets the requirements of § 417.2(c) of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) Each establishment must make a record of each reassessment required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and must document the reasons for any changes to the HACCP plan based on the reassessment, or the reasons for not changing the HACCP plan based on the reassessment. For annual reassessments, if the establishment determines that no changes are needed to its HACCP plan, it is not required to document the basis for this determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reassessment of the hazard analysis.</E> Any establishment that does not have a HACCP plan because a hazard analysis has revealed no food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur shall reassess the adequacy of the hazard analysis whenever a change occurs that could reasonably affect whether a food safety hazard exists. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes in: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; slaughter or processing methods or systems; production volume; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or, the intended use or consumers of the finished product.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 424.22</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Certain other permitted uses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Under appropriate declaration as required in parts 316 and 317 of this chapter, the following substances may be added to meat:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Common salt, approved sugars (sucrose, cane or beet sugar), maple sugar, dextrose, invert sugar, honey, corn syrup solids (corn syrup, glucose syrup and fructose), wood smoke, vinegar, flavorings, spices, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, potassium nitrite, and other food and color additives specified in the chart in paragraph (c) of this section may be added to meat under conditions, if any, specified in this part or in part 317 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Artificial flavorings.</E> Other harmless artificial flavorings may be added to meat, with the approval of the Administrator in specific cases.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Coloring matter and dyes.</E> Coloring matter and dyes, other than those specified in a regulation permitting that use in this chapter or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A and Subchapter B, may be applied to meat mixed with rendered fat, applied to natural and artificial casings, and applied to such casings enclosing products, if approved by the Administrator in specific cases. When any coloring matter or dye is applied to casings, there shall be no penetration of coloring into the product.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate) in bacon</E>—(1) <E T="03">Pumped bacon.</E> With respect to bacon injected with curing ingredients and massaged bacon, sodium nitrite shall be used at 120 parts per million (ppm) ingoing or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite shall be used (148 ppm ingoing); and 550 ppm of sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate) shall be used. Sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate have a molecular weight of approximately 198. Hydrated forms of these substances shall be adjusted to attain the equivalent of 550 ppm of sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate.</P>

              <P>(i) The Department shall collect samples of pumped bacon from producing plants and analyze them for the level of nitrosamines by the Thermal Energy Analyzer (TEA). In the event that a TEA analysis indicates that a confirmable level of nitrosamines might be present, additional samples shall be collected and analyzed by gas chromatography. Presumptive positive results <PRTPAGE P="586"/>must be confirmed by mass spectrometry before being considered positive. If during the interval required for the Department to analyze the confirmatory samples by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, changes are made in processing procedures which are expected to result in no confirmable levels of nitrosamines in pumped bacon produced by these new procedures, an establishment may submit samples to USDA for analysis upon prior notification and arrangements with USDA. If, however, an establishment furnishes USDA with laboratory results from testing five consecutive lots of pumped bacon produced under the new procedures and the testing is performed by the USDA methodology and procedures, those results will be utilized in making the determination concerning the product produced under the new procedures. Should the results of these tests reveal that confirmable levels of nitrosamines are not indicated in any of the five consecutive lots, the confirmation analysis by USDA shall be terminated and the establishment shall revert to normal monitoring status. In the event the test results continue to indicate nitrosamines, however, USDA shall proceed in its confirmation analysis on the original samples taken for confirmation. If any one of the original samples collected by USDA for confirmation is found to contain confirmable levels of nitrosamines, all pumped bacon in the producing establishment and all future production will be retained. The Department shall sample and analyze such retained pumped bacon for nitrosamines on a lot by lot basis. A production lot shall be that pumped bacon produced by the establishment in any single shift. Samples from any lot of pumped bacon under retention found to contain nitrosamines at a confirmable level shall cause the lot of pumped bacon to be disposed of in a manner to ensure it will not form nitrosamines when cooked. Such disposal may include incorporation of the uncooked pumped bacon as an ingredient of another meat provided it is processed for eating without further preparation in a manner to preclude the formation of nitrosamines. Bacon subsequently produced shall not be retained because of nitrosamines if the operator of the establishment makes adjustments in the processing of the product and laboratory results obtained by TEA analysis of samples from five consecutive normal sized lots of pumped bacon indicates that the product being produced contains no confirmable levels of nitrosamines. These tests from five consecutive normal sized lots of pumped bacon shall be conducted by the Department. However, if the establishment furnishes the Department with the results of tests conducted under the methodology and procedures used by the Department, such test results will be utilized in making the determination concerning the nitrosamine content of the product. All tests of pumped bacon for nitrosamines under this paragraph (b)(1)(i) shall be made on pumped bacon cooked at 340 degrees F. for 3 minutes on each side. In order to determine that no confirmable levels of nitrosamines are present in a sample tested, the testing must be performed by methodology and procedures that would detect the presence of any nitrosamines at 10 ppb.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, sodium nitrite may be used at:</P>
              <P>(A) 100 ppm ingoing (potassium nitrite at 123 ppm ingoing); and 550 ppm sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate) shall be used; or</P>

              <P>(B) A predetermined level between 40 and 80 ppm (potassium nitrite at a level between 49 and 99 ppm); 550 ppm sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate (isoascorbate); and additional sucrose or other similar fermentable carbohydrate at a minimum of 0.7 percent and an inoculum of lactic acid producing bacteria such as <E T="03">Pediococcus acetolactii</E> or other bacteria demonstrated to be equally effective in preventing the production of botulinum toxin at a level sufficient for the purpose of preventing the production of botulinum toxin.</P>

              <P>(C) The Department shall collect samples of bacon from establishments producing under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and analyze them for the level of nitrosamines. Samples shall be randomly selected throughout the production of a lot. The actual sampling <PRTPAGE P="587"/>plans and methods of analysis that are used will result in approximately the same likelihood as under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section of having a presumptive positive result when the true mean level of nitrosamines in a production lot is 10 ppb. In the event of a presumptive positive result, the establishment shall become subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Immersion cured bacon.</E> Immersion cured bacon may be placed in a brine solution containing salt, nitrite and flavoring material or in a container with salt, nitrite and flavoring material. Sodium nitrite shall not exceed 120 ppm ingoing or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite (148 ppm ingoing) based on the actual or estimated skin-free green weight of the bacon bellies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Bacon made with dry curing materials.</E> With respect to bacon made with dry curing materials, the product shall be cured by applying a premeasured amount of cure mixture to the bacon belly surfaces, completely covering the surfaces. Sodium nitrite shall not exceed 200 ppm ingoing or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite (246 ppm ingoing) in dry cured bacon based on the actual or estimated skin-free green weight of the bacon belly.</P>
              <P>(c) Irradiation of meat food and poultry products.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> Meat food and poultry products may be treated to reduce foodborne pathogens and to extend product shelf-life by the use of sources of ionizing radiation as identified in 21 CFR 179.26(a). Official establishments must irradiate meat food and poultry products in accordance with 21 CFR 179.26(b), the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system requirements in part 417 of this chapter, and the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Dosimetry.</E> Official establishments that irradiate meat food and poultry products must have the following procedures in place:</P>
              <P>(i) Laboratory operation procedures for determining the absorbed dose value from the dosimeter.</P>

              <P>(ii) Calibration criteria for verifying the accuracy and consistency of any means of measurement (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> time clocks and weight scales).</P>
              <P>(iii) Calibration and accountability criteria for verifying the traceability and accuracy of dosimeters for the intended purpose, and the verification of calibration at least every 12 months. To confirm traceability, establishments must relate, through documentation, the end point measurement of a dosimeter to recognized standards.</P>
              <P>(iv) Procedures for ensuring that the product unit is dose mapped to identify the regions of minimum and maximum absorbed dose and such regions are consistent from one product unit to another of like product.</P>
              <P>(v) Procedures for accounting for the total absorbed dose received by the product unit (e.g., partial applications of the absorbed dose within one production lot).</P>
              <P>(vi) Procedures for verifying routine dosimetry, i.e., assuring each production lot receives the total absorbed dose. Establishments may either position one dosimeter at the regions of minimum and maximum absorbed dose (or at one region verified to represent such) on at least the first, middle, and last product unit in each production lot or use statistically based validation and dose mapping to determine the number and placement of dosimeters in each production lot.</P>
              <P>(vii) Procedures for verifying the relationship of absorbed dose as measured by the dosimeter to time exposure of the product unit to the radiation source.</P>
              <P>(viii) Procedures for verifying the integrity of the radiation source and processing procedure. Aside from expected and verified radiation source activity decay for radionuclide sources, the radiation source or processing procedure must not be altered, modified, replenished, or adjusted without repeating dose mapping of product units to redefine the regions of minimum and maximum absorbed dose.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> Official establishments that irradiate meat food or poultry products must have the following documentation on premises, available to FSIS:</P>

              <P>(i) Documentation that the irradiation facility is licensed or possesses gamma radiation sources registered <PRTPAGE P="588"/>with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or the appropriate State government acting under authority granted by the NRC.</P>
              <P>(ii) Documentation that the machine radiation source irradiation facility is registered with the appropriate State government, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(iii) Documentation that a worker safety program addressing OSHA regulations (29 CFR chapter XVII) is in place.</P>
              <P>(iv) Citations or other documents that relate to incidences in which the establishment was found not to comply with Federal or State agency requirements for irradiation facilities.</P>
              <P>(v) A certification by the operator that the irradiation facility personnel will only operate under supervision of a person who has successfully completed a course of instruction for operators of food irradiation facilities.</P>
              <P>(vi) A certification by the operator that the key irradiation personnel, who monitor or control daily operations, have been trained in food technology, irradiation processing, and radiation health and safety.</P>

              <P>(vii) Guarantees from the suppliers of all food-contact packaging materials that may be subject to irradiation that those materials comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> (i) The labels on packages of meat food and poultry products irradiated in their entirety, in conformance with this section and with 21 CFR 179.26(a) and (b), must bear the logo shown at the end of this paragraph. Unless the word “Irradiated” is part of the product name, labels also must bear a statement such as “Treated with radiation” or “Treated by irradiation.” The logo must be placed in conjunction with the required statement, if the statement is used. The statement is not required to be more prominent than the declaration of ingredients required under § 317.2(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <GPH DEEP="102" SPAN="1">
                <GID>ER23DE99.000</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>(ii) For meat food or poultry products that have been irradiated in their entirety, but that are not sold in packages, the required logo must be displayed to the purchaser with either the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or a counter sign, card, or other appropriate device bearing the information that the product has been treated with radiation. In either case, the information must be prominently and conspicuously displayed to purchasers. Unless the word “Irradiated” is part of the product name, the labeling counter sign, card, or other device also must bear a statement such as “Treated with radiation” or “Treated by irradiation.” The logo must be placed in conjunction with the required statement, if the statement is used.</P>
              <P>(iii) The inclusion of an irradiated meat food or poultry product ingredient in any multi-ingredient meat food or poultry product must be reflected in the ingredient statement on the finished product labeling.</P>
              <P>(iv) Optional labeling statements about the purpose for radiation processing may be included on the product label in addition to the stated requirements elsewhere in this section, provided that such statements are not false or misleading. Statements that there has been a specific reduction in microbial pathogens must be substantiated by processing documentation.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Listeria monocytogenes</E> can contaminate RTE products that are exposed to the environment after they have undergone a lethality treatment. <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> is a hazard that an establishment producing post-lethality exposed RTE products must control through its HACCP plan or prevent in the processing environment through a Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program. RTE product is adulterated if it contains <E T="03">L. monocytogenes,</E> or if it comes into direct contact with a food contact surface that is contaminated with <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E> Establishments must not release into commerce product that contains <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or that has been in contact with a food contact surface contaminated with <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> without first reworking the product using a process that is destructive of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) In order to maintain the sanitary conditions necessary to meet this requirement, an establishment producing post-lethality exposed RTE product must comply with the requirements included in one of the three following alternatives:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Alternative 1.</E> Use of a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product <E T="03">and</E> an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E> If an establishment chooses this alternative:</P>
            <P>(i) The post-lethality treatment must be included in the establishment's HACCP plan. The antimicrobial agent or process used to suppress or limit the growth of the pathogen must be included in either the establishment's HACCP plan or its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program.</P>

            <P>(ii) The establishment must validate the effectiveness of the post-lethality treatment incorporated in its HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.4. The establishment must document, either in its HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program, that the antimicrobial agent or process, as used, is effective in suppressing or limiting growth of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternative 2.</E> Use of either a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product <E T="03">or</E> an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits growth of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E> If an establishment chooses this alternative:</P>
            <P>(i) The post-lethality treatment must be included in the establishment's HACCP plan. The antimicrobial agent or process used to suppress or limit growth of the pathogen must be included in either the establishment's HACCP plan or its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program.</P>

            <P>(ii) The establishment must validate the effectiveness of a post-lethality treatment incorporated in its HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.4. The establishment must document in its HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program that the antimicrobial agent or process, as used, is effective in suppressing or limiting growth of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(iii) If an establishment chooses this alternative and chooses to use only an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes,</E> its sanitation program must:</P>

            <P>(A) Provide for testing of food contact surfaces in the post-lethality processing environment to ensure that the surfaces are sanitary and free of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or of an indicator organism;</P>

            <P>(B) Identify the conditions under which the establishment will implement hold-and-test procedures following a positive test of a food-contact surface for an indicator organism;<PRTPAGE P="591"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) State the frequency with which testing will be done;</P>
            <P>(D) Identify the size and location of the sites that will be sampled; and</P>

            <P>(E) Include an explanation of why the testing frequency is sufficient to ensure that effective control of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or of indicator organisms is maintained.</P>

            <P>(iv) An establishment that chooses this alternative and uses a post-lethality treatment of product will likely be subject to more frequent verification testing by FSIS than if it had chosen Alternative 1. An establishment that chooses this alternative and uses an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> will likely be subject to more frequent FSIS verification testing than if it uses a post-lethality treatment.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative 3.</E> Use of sanitation measures only.</P>
            <P>(i) If an establishment chooses this alternative, its sanitation program must:</P>

            <P>(A) Provide for testing of food contact surfaces in the post-lethality processing environment to ensure that the surfaces are sanitary and free of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or of an indicator organism;</P>

            <P>(ii) An establishment producing a deli product or a hotdog product, in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, must meet the following requirements:</P>

            <P>(A) The establishment must verify that the corrective actions that it takes with respect to sanitation after an initial positive test for <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or an indicator organism on a food contact surface in the post-lethality processing environment are effective by conducting follow-up testing that includes a targeted test of the specific site on the food contact surface area that is the most likely source of contamination by the organism and such additional tests in the surrounding food contact surface area as are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the corrective actions.</P>
            <P>(B) During this follow-up testing, if the establishment obtains a second positive test for an indicator organism, the establishment must hold lots of product that may have become contaminated by contact with the food contact surface until the establishment corrects the problem indicated by the test result.</P>

            <P>(C) In order to release into commerce product held under this section, the establishment must sample and test the lots for <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or an indicator organism using a sampling method and frequency that will provide a level of statistical confidence that ensures that each lot is not adulterated with <E T="03">L. monocytogenes.</E> The establishment must document the results of this testing. Alternatively, the establishment may rework the held product using a process that is destructive of <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or the indicator organism.</P>
            <P>(iii) An establishment that chooses Alternative 3 is likely to be subject to more frequent verification testing by FSIS than an establishment that has chosen Alternative 1 or 2. An establishment that chooses Alternative 3 and that produces deli meat or hotdog products is likely to be subject to more frequent verification testing than one that does not produce such products.</P>
            <P>(c) For all three alternatives in paragraph (b):</P>

            <P>(1) Establishments may use verification testing that includes tests for <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> or an indicator organism, such as <E T="03">Listeria</E> species, to verify the effectiveness of their sanitation procedures in the post-lethality processing environment.</P>
            <P>(2) Sanitation measures for controlling <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> and procedures for antimicrobial agents or processes that suppress or limit the growth of the pathogen may be incorporated either in the establishment's HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other <PRTPAGE P="592"/>prerequisite program. When these control procedures are incorporated into the Sanitation SOP or prerequisite program, and not as a CCP in the HACCP plan, the establishment must have documentation that supports the decision in its hazard analysis that <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> is not a hazard that is reasonably likely to occur.</P>
            <P>(3) The establishment must maintain sanitation in the post-lethality processing environment in accordance with part 416.</P>
            <P>(4) If <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> control measures are included in the HACCP plan, the establishment must validate and verify the effectiveness of measures for controlling <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> included in its HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.4.</P>
            <P>(5) If <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> control measures are included in the Sanitation SOP, the effectiveness of the measures must be evaluated in accordance with § 416.14.</P>
            <P>(6) If the measures for addressing <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> are addressed in a prerequisite program other than the Sanitation SOP, the establishment must include the program and the results produced by the program in the documentation that the establishment is required to maintain under 9 CFR 417.5.</P>
            <P>(7) The establishment must make the verification results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the measures it employs, whether under its HACCP plan or its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program, available upon request to FSIS inspection personnel.</P>
            <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(e) An establishment that controls <E T="03">L. monocytogenes</E> by using a post-lethality treatment or an antimicrobial agent or process that eliminates or reduces, or suppresses or limits the growth of the organism may declare this fact on the product label provided that the establishment has validated the claim.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Containers and closures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Examination and handling of empty containers.</E> (1) Empty containers, closures, and flexible pouch roll stock must be evaluated by the establishment to ensure that they are free of structural defects and damage that may affect product or container integrity. Such an examination should be based on a statistical sampling plan.</P>
            <P>(2) All empty containers, closures, and flexible pouch roll stock must be stored, handled, and conveyed in such a manner that will prevent damage that could affect the hermetic condition of the sealed container.</P>
            <P>(3) Just before filling, rigid containers must be cleaned to prevent incorporation of foreign matter into the finished product. Closures, semirigid containers, preformed flexible pouches, and flexible pouch roll stock contained in original wrappings do not need to be cleaned before use.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Closure examinations for rigid containers (cans)</E>—(1) <E T="03">Visual examinations.</E> A closure technician must visually examine the double seams formed by each closing machine head. When seam defects (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> cutovers, sharpness, knocked down flanges, false seams, droops) are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine, must be taken. In addition to the double seams, the entire container must be examined for product leakage or obvious defects. A visual examination must be performed on at least one container from each closing machine head, and the observations, along with any corrective actions, must be recorded. Visual examinations must be conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure and should be conducted at least every 30 minutes of continuous closing machine operation. Additional visual examinations must be made by the closure technician at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for changes in container size).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Teardown examinations.</E> Teardown examinations of double seams formed by each closing machine head must be performed by a closure technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be made at intervals of not more than 4 hours of continuous closing machine operation. At least one container from each closing head must be examined on the packer's end during each regular examination period. Examination results along with any necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine, must be promptly recorded by the closure technician. The establishment must have container specification guidelines for double seam integrity on file and available for review by Program employees. A teardown examination of the can maker's end must be performed on at least one container selected from each closing machine during each examination period except when teardown examinations are made on incoming empty containers or when, in the case of self-manufactured containers, the containers are made in the vicinity of the establishment and the container plant records are made available to Program employees. Additional teardown examinations on the packer's end should be made at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in a closing machine and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size). The following procedures must be used in teardown examinations of double seams:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Dimensional measurement.</E> One of the following two methods must be employed for dimensional measurements of the double seam.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Micrometer measurement.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) For cylindrical containers, measure the following dimensions (Figure 1 to § 431.2) at three points approximately 120 degrees apart on the double seam excluding and at least one-half inch from the side seam juncture:
            </P>
            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Double seam length—W;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Double seam thickness—S;</P>

            </GPH>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Seamscope or seam projector.</E> Required measurements of the seam include thickness, body hook, and overlap.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Seam thickness.</E> Seam thickness must be obtained by micrometer. For cylindrical containers, at least two locations, excluding the side seam juncture, must be used to obtain the required measurements.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Seam tightness.</E> Regardless of the dimensional measurement method used to measure seam dimensions, at a minimum, the seam(s) examined must be stripped to assess the degree of wrinkling.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Side seam juncture rating.</E> Regardless of the dimensional measurement method used to measure seam dimensions, the cover hook must be stripped to examine the cover hook droop at the juncture for containers having side seams.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Examination of noncylindrical containers.</E> Examination of noncylindrical containers (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> square, rectangular, <PRTPAGE P="596"/>“D”-shaped, and irregularly-shaped) must be conducted as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section except that the required dimensional measurements must be made on the double seam at the points listed in the establishment's container specification guidelines.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Closure examinations for glass containers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Visual examinations.</E> A closure technician must visually assess the adequacy of the closures formed by each closing machine. When closure defects, such as loose or cocked caps, fractured or cracked containers and low vacuum jars, are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine must be taken and recorded. In addition to the closures, the entire container must be examined for defects. Visual examinations must be made with sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure and should be conducted at least every 30 minutes of continuous closing machine operation. Additional visual examinations must be made by the closure technician and the observations recorded at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine, and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Closure examinations and tests.</E> Depending upon the container and closure, tests must be performed by a closure technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be made either before or after thermal processing and at intervals of not more than 4 hours of continuous closing machine operation. At least one container from each closing machine must be examined during each regular examination period. Examination results along with any necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine, must be promptly recorded by the closure technician. The establishment must have specification guidelines for closure integrity on file and available for review by Program employees. Additional closure examinations should be made at the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine, and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Closure examinations for semi-rigid and flexible containers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Heat seals</E>—(i) <E T="03">Visual examinations.</E> A closure technician must visually examine the seals formed by each sealing machine. When sealing defects are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the sealing machine, must be taken and recorded. In addition to examining the heat seals, the entire container must be examined for product leakage or obvious defects. Visual examinations must be performed before and after the thermal processing operation and with sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be conducted at least in accordance with a statistical sampling plan. All defects noted and corrective actions taken must be promptly recorded.</P>

Additionally, bulb sheaths or probes of indicating temperature devices and probes of temperature/time recording devices must be installed either within the retort shell or in external wells attached to the retort. External wells must be connected to the retort through at least a <FR>3/4</FR> inch (1.9 cm) diameter opening and equipped with a <FR>1/16</FR> inch (1.6 mm) or larger bleeder opening so located as to provide a constant flow of steam past the length of the bulb or probe. The bleeder for the external wells must emit steam continuously during the entire thermal processing period.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Steam inlet.</E> The steam inlet to each retort must be large enough to provide steam for proper operation of the retort, and must enter at a point(s) to facilitate air removal during venting.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Bleeder and vent mufflers.</E> If mufflers are used on bleeders or vent systems, the establishment must have on <PRTPAGE P="600"/>file documentation that the mufflers do not impede the removal of air from the retort.

All bleeders must be arranged so that the retort operator can observe that they are functioning properly. For horizontal retorts, batch agitating retorts, and continuous rotary retorts, bleeders must be located within approximately 1 foot (or 30 cm) of the outmost locations of containers at each end along the top of the retort. Additional bleeders must be located not more than 8 feet (2.4 m) apart along the top. This information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review. Vertical retorts must have at least one bleeder opening located in the portion of the retort opposite the steam inlet. Hydrostatic retorts must have bleeder openings <FR>1/4</FR> inch (or 6 mm) or larger which are to be located in the steam chamber(s) opposite the point of steam entry. Bleeders may be installed at positions other than those specified above, as long as the establishment has heat distribution data or other documentation from the manufacturer or from a processing authority demonstrating that the bleeders accomplish removal of air and circulate the steam within the retort.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Batch still retorts</E>—(i) <E T="03">Crate supports.</E> Vertical still retorts with bottom steam entry must employ bottom retort crate supports. Baffle plates must not be used in the bottom of retorts.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Steam spreader.</E> Perforated steam spreaders, if used, must be maintained to ensure they are not blocked or otherwise inoperative. Horizontal still retorts must be equipped with perforated steam spreaders that extend the full length of the retort unless the adequacy of another arrangement is documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority. Such information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Condensate removal.</E> In retorts having a steam inlet above the level of the lowest container, a bleeder must be installed in the bottom of the retort to remove condensate. The condensate bleeder must be so arranged that the retort operator can observe that it is functioning properly. The condensate bleeder must be checked with sufficient frequency to ensure adequate removal of condensate. Visual checks should be performed at intervals of not more than 15 minutes and the results recorded. Intermittent condensate removal systems must be equipped with an automatic alarm system that will serve as a continuous monitor of condensate bleeder functioning. The automatic alarm system must be tested at the beginning of each shift for proper functioning and the results recorded. If the alarm system is not functioning properly, it must be repaired before the retort is used.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Stacking equipment</E>—(A) <E T="03">Equipment for holding or stacking containers in retorts.</E> Crates, trays, gondolas, carts, and other vehicles for holding or stacking product containers in the retort must be so constructed to ensure steam circulation during the venting, come-up, and process times. The bottom of each vehicle must have perforations at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter on 2 inch (or 5 cm) centers or the equivalent unless the adequacy of another arrangement is documented by heat distribution data or other documentation from a processing authority and such information is maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Divider plates.</E> Whenever one or more divider plates are used between any two layers of containers or placed on the bottom of a retort vehicle, the establishment must have on file documentation that the venting procedure allows the air to be removed from the retort before timing of the thermal process is started. Such documentation must be in the form of heat distribution data or documentation from a processing authority. This information <PRTPAGE P="601"/>must be made available to Program employees for review.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Vents.</E> (A) Vents must be located in that portion of the retort opposite the steam inlet and must be designed, installed, and operated in such a way that air is removed from the retort before timing of the thermal process is started. Vents must be controlled by a gate, plug cock, or other full-flow valve which must be fully opened to permit rapid removal of air from retorts during the venting period.</P>
            <P>(B) Vents must not be connected to a closed drain system without an atmospheric break in the line. Where a retort manifold connects several pipes from a single retort, the manifold must be controlled by a gate, plug cock, or other full-flow valve and the manifold must be of a size such that the cross-sectional area of the manifold is larger than the total cross-sectional area of all connecting vents. The discharge must not be connected to a closed drain without an atmospheric break in the line. A manifold header connecting vents or manifolds from several still retorts must lead to the atmosphere. The manifold header must not be controlled by a valve and must be of a size such that the cross-sectional area is at least equal to the total cross-sectional area of all connecting retort manifold pipes from the maximum number of retorts to be vented simultaneously.</P>
            <P>(C) Some typical installations and operating procedures are described below. Other retort installations, vent piping arrangements, operating procedures or auxiliary equipment such as divider plates may be used provided there is documentation that the air is removed from the retort before the process is started. Such documentation must be in the form of heat distribution data or other documentation from the equipment manufacturer or processing authority. This information must be maintained on file by the establishment and made available to Program employees for review.</P>
            <P>(D) For crateless retort installations, the establishment must have heat distribution data or other documentation from the equipment manufacturer or from a processing authority that demonstrates that the venting procedure used accomplishes the removal of air and condensate.

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For temperature drops of 10 °F (or 5.5 °C) or more, all containers in the retort must be given an emergency still process (developed per § 431.3(b)). The time the reel was stopped and the time the retort was used for a still retort process must be marked on the temperature/time recording device by the establishment and entered on the other production records required in § 431.7. Alternatively, container entry to the retort must be prevented and the reel restarted to empty the retort. The discharged containers must be either reprocessed, repacked and reprocessed, or destroyed. Product to be destroyed must be handled as “U.S. Inspected and Condemned,” as defined in § 301.2 of this chapter, or as “U.S. Condemned,” as defined in § 381.1(b) of this chapter, and disposed of in accordance with part 314 of this chapter or with § 381.95 of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Deviations identified through record review.</E> Whenever a deviation is noted during review of the processing and production records required by § 431.8(a) and (b), the establishment must hold the product involved and the deviation must be handled in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Process deviation file.</E> The establishment must maintain full records regarding the handling of each deviation. Such records must include, at a minimum, the appropriate processing and production records, a full description of the corrective actions taken, the evaluation procedures and results, and the disposition of the affected product.

            <SUBJECT>Finished product inspection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Finished product inspections must be handled according to:</P>
            <P>(1) An HACCP plan for canned product that addresses hazards associated with microbiological contamination;</P>
            <P>(2) An FSIS-approved total quality control system;</P>
            <P>(3) Alternative documented procedures that will ensure that only safe and stable product is shipped in commerce; or</P>
            <P>(4) Paragraph (b) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="617"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) Procedures for handling finished product inspections where the HACCP plan for thermally processed/commercially sterile product does not address food safety hazards associated with microbial contamination, where there is no approved total quality control system, or where the establishment has no alternative documented procedures for handling process deviations.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Incubation of shelf stable canned produc</E>t—(i) <E T="03">Incubator.</E> The establishment must provide incubation facilities which include an accurate temperature/time recording device, an indicating temperature device, a means for the circulation of the air inside the incubator to prevent temperature variations, and a means to prevent unauthorized entry into the facility. The Program is responsible for the security of the incubator.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Incubation temperature.</E> The incubation temperature must be maintained at 95±5 °F (35±2.8 °C). If the incubation temperature falls below 90 °F (or 32 °C) or exceeds 100 °F (or 38 °C) but does not reach 103 °F (or 39.5 °C), the incubation temperature must be adjusted within the required range and the incubation time extended for the time the sample containers were held at the deviant temperature. If the incubation temperature is at or above 103 °F (or 39.5 °C) for more than 2 hours, the incubation test(s) must be terminated, the temperature lowered to within the required range, and new sample containers incubated for the required time.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Product requiring incubation.</E> Shelf stable product requiring incubation includes:</P>
            <P>(A) Low acid products as defined in § 431.1; and</P>
            <P>(B) Acidified low acid products as defined in § 431.1.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Incubation samples.</E> (A) From each load of product processed in a batch-type thermal processing system (still or agitation), the establishment must select at least one container for incubation.</P>
            <P>(B) For continuous rotary retorts, hydrostatic retorts, or other continuous-type thermal processing systems, the establishment must select at least one container per 1,000 for incubation.</P>
            <P>(C) Only normal-appearing containers must be selected for incubation.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Incubation time.</E> Canned product requiring incubation must be incubated for not less than 10 days (240 hours) under the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Incubation checks and record maintenance.</E> Designated establishment employees must visually check all containers under incubation each working day and the inspector must be notified when abnormal containers are detected. All abnormal containers should be allowed to cool before a final decision on their condition is made. For each incubation test the establishment must record at least the product name, container size, container code, number of containers incubated, in and out dates, and incubation results. The establishment must retain such records, along with copies of the temperature/time recording charts, in accordance with § 431.8(d).</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Abnormal containers.</E> The finding of abnormal containers (as defined in § 431.1) among incubation samples is cause to officially retain at least the code lot involved.</P>
            <P>(viii) <E T="03">Shipping.</E> No product must be shipped from the establishment before the end of the required incubation period. An establishment wishing to ship product prior to the completion of the required incubation period must submit a written proposal to the District Office. Such a proposal must include provisions that will assure that shipped product will not reach the retail level of distribution before sample incubation is completed and that product can be returned promptly to the establishment should such action be deemed necessary by the incubation test results. Upon receipt of written approval from the District Office, product may be routinely shipped provided the establishment continues to comply with all requirements of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Container condition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Normal containers.</E> Only normal-appearing containers must be shipped from an establishment as determined by an appropriate sampling plan or other means acceptable to program employees.<PRTPAGE P="618"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Abnormal containers.</E> When abnormal containers are detected by any means other than incubation, the establishment must inform the inspector, and the affected code lot(s) must not be shipped until the Program has determined that the product is safe and stable. Such a determination will take into account the cause and level of abnormals in the affected lot(s) as well as any product disposition actions either taken or proposed by the establishment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Accreditation</E>—Determination by FSIS that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of raw or processed meat and poultry products, because it has met the requirements for accreditation specified in this part, for the presence and amount of all four food chemistry analytes (protein, moisture, fat, and salt); or a determination by FSIS that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of raw or processed meat and poultry products, because it has met the requirements for accreditation in this part, for the presence and amount of a specified chemical residue of any one of several classes of chemical residues. A laboratory may hold more than one accreditation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Accredited laboratory</E>—A non-Federal analytical laboratory that has met the requirements for accreditation specified in this Part and, therefore, at an establishment's discretion, may be used in lieu of an FSIS laboratory for analyzing official regulatory samples. Payment for the analysis of official samples is to be made by the establishment using the accredited laboratory.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP)</E>—The FSIS program in which non-Federal laboratories are accredited as eligible to perform analyses on official regulatory samples of raw or processed meat and poultry products, and through which a check sample program for quality assurance is conducted.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Chemical residue misidentification</E>—see “Correct chemical residue identification” definition.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Coefficient of variation (CV)</E>—The standard deviation of a distribution of analytical values multiplied by 100 and divided by the mean of those values.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Comparison mean</E>—The average result, for a sample, obtained from all submitted results that have a large deviation measure of zero. When only two laboratories perform the analysis and the large deviation measure is not zero, alternative procedures for establishing a comparison mean may be employed by FSIS. For purposes of computing the comparison mean, a laboratory's “result” for a food chemistry analyte is the obtained analytical value; a laboratory's “result” for a chemical residue is the logarithmic transformation of the obtained analytical value.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Correct chemical residue identification</E>—Reporting by a laboratory of the presence and analytical value of a chemical residue that was included in <PRTPAGE P="619"/>the ALP check sample above the minimum reporting level. Failure of a laboratory to report the presence of such a chemical residue is considered a misidentification. In addition, reporting the presence of and analytical value for a residue that was not included in the ALP check sample above the minimum reporting level is considered a misidentification.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">CUSUM</E>—A class of statistical procedures for assessing whether or not a process is “in control.” Each CUSUM value is constructed by accumulating incremental values obtained from observed results of the process, and then determined to either exceed or fall within acceptable limits for that process. The initial CUSUM values for each laboratory whose application for accreditation is accepted are set at zero. The CUSUM values are reset to zero at the beginning of each year; that is, the CUSUM values associated with the first maintenance check sample each year are set equal to the CUSUM increment for that sample. The four CUSUM procedures are:</P>
            <P>(1) Positive systematic laboratory difference CUSUM (CUSUM-P)—monitors how consistently an accredited laboratory gets numerically greater results than the comparison mean;</P>
            <P>(2) Negative systematic laboratory difference CUSUM (CUSUM-N)—monitors how consistently an accredited laboratory gets numerically smaller results than the comparison mean;</P>
            <P>(3) Variability CUSUM (CUSUM-V)—monitors the average “total deviation” (i.e., the combination of the random fluctuations and systematic differences) between an accredited laboratory's results and the comparison mean; and</P>
            <P>(4) Individual large deviation CUSUM (CUSUM-D)—monitors the magnitude and frequency of large differences between the results of an accredited laboratory and the comparison mean.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Food chemistry</E>—For the purposes of part 439, “food chemistry” will refer to analysis of raw or processed meat or poultry products for the analytes moisture, protein, fat, and salt. All four analytes must be determined when a food chemistry analysis is conducted, unless otherwise advised by the ALP.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Individual large deviation</E>—An analytical result that differs from the sample comparison mean by more than would be expected assuming normal laboratory variability.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Initial accreditation check sample</E>—A sample provided by the ALP to a non-Federal laboratory to determine whether the laboratory's analytical capability meets the standards for granting accreditation.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Inter-laboratory accreditation maintenance check sample</E>—A sample provided by FSIS to an accredited laboratory to assist in determining whether the laboratory is maintaining acceptable levels of analytical capability.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Large deviation measure</E>—A measure that quantifies an unacceptably large difference between a laboratory's analytical result and the sample comparison mean.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Minimum proficiency level</E> (MPL)—The minimum concentration of a residue at which an analytical result will be used to assess a laboratory's quantification capability. This concentration is an estimate of the smallest concentration for which the average coefficient of variation (CV) for reproducibility (i.e., combined within and between laboratory variability) does not exceed 20 percent.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Minimum reporting level</E> (MRL)—The number such that if any obtained analytical value for a residue in a check sample or official sample equals or exceeds this number, then the residue is reported together with the obtained analytical value.</P>
            <P>(p) <E T="03">Official sample</E>—A sample selected by an inspector or inspection service employee in accordance with FSIS procedures for regulatory use.</P>
            <P>(q) <E T="03">Probation</E>—The period commencing with official notification to an accredited laboratory that its check sample results no longer satisfy the performance requirements specified in this rule, and ending with official notification that accreditation either is fully restored, is suspended, or is revoked.</P>
            <P>(r) <E T="03">QA</E> (See Quality assurance recovery).</P>
            <P>(s) <E T="03">QC</E> (See Quality control recovery).</P>
            <P>(t) <E T="03">Quality assurance (QA) recovery</E>—The ratio of a laboratory's analytical value for a check sample residue to the <PRTPAGE P="620"/>established level of the analyte in the check sample, multiplied by 100. As dictated by the procedures for the analyte, the analytical value may be adjusted prior to the recovery computation.</P>
            <P>(u) <E T="03">Quality control (QC) recovery</E>—The ratio of a laboratory's analytical value of a quality control standard to the established level of the analyte in the standard, multiplied by 100. As dictated by the procedures for the analyte, the analytical value may be adjusted prior to the recovery computation.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Refusal of accreditation</E>—An action taken by FSIS when a laboratory that is applying for accreditation is denied the accreditation.</P>
            <P>(w) <E T="03">Responsibly connected</E>—Any individual, or entity, that is a partner, officer, director, manager, or owner of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of the applicant or recipient of accreditation or an employee in a managerial or executive capacity or any employee who conducts or supervises the chemical analysis of FSIS official samples.</P>
            <P>(x) <E T="03">Revocation of accreditation</E>—An action taken by FSIS against a laboratory, removing the laboratory's right to analyze official samples.</P>
            <P>(y) <E T="03">Standardizing constant</E>—A number that results from a mathematical adjustment to the “standardizing value” and is used to compute the standardized difference for a check sample result. The number takes into consideration the expected variance of the difference between the accredited or applying laboratory's result(s) and the comparison mean for a sample, the standardizing value, the correlation and number of repeated results by a laboratory on a sample, and the number of laboratories that analyzed a sample.</P>
            <P>(z) <E T="03">Standardized difference</E>—The quotient of the difference between a laboratory's result on a sample and the comparison mean of the sample divided by the standardizing constant.</P>
            <P>(aa) <E T="03">Standardizing value</E>—A number representing the performance standard deviation of an individual result. The number is given, or computed by, the information provided in Tables 1 and 2 to this paragraph (aa).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for obtaining accreditation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Analytical laboratories may be accredited for the analyses of food chemistry analytes, as defined in § 439.1 of this part, or a specific chemical residue or a class of chemical residues in raw or processed meat and poultry products.</P>
            <P>(b) Accreditation will be given only if the applying laboratory successfully satisfies the requirements presented below. For food chemistry accreditation, the requirements must be satisfied for all four analytes.</P>
            <P>(c) This accreditation authorizes official FSIS acceptance of the analytical test results provided by these laboratories on official samples.</P>
            <P>(d) To obtain FSIS accreditation, an analytical laboratory must:</P>
            <P>(1) Be supervised by a person holding, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree in chemistry, food science, food technology, or a related field.</P>
            <P>(i) For food chemistry accreditation, the supervisor must also have one year's experience in food chemistry analysis, or equivalent qualifications, as determined by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>(ii) For chemical residue accreditation, either the supervisor or the analyst assigned to analyze the sample must also have three years' experience determining analytes at or below part <PRTPAGE P="622"/>per million levels, or equivalent qualifications, as determined by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(2) Demonstrate an ability to achieve quality assurance levels that are within acceptable limits for systemic laboratory difference, variability, and individual large deviations, in the analyte category for which accreditation is sought, using analytical procedures designated by the FSIS ALP as being acceptable. An applying laboratory will successfully demonstrate these capabilities for:</P>
            <P>(i) Food chemistry if its results from a 36 check sample accreditation study each satisfy the criteria presented in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Chemical residues if its analytical results for each specific chemical residue provided in a check sample accreditation study containing a minimum of 14 check samples satisfy the criteria presented in paragraph (e) of this section, including criteria for QA and QC recovery and for residue identification. In addition, if the laboratory is requesting accreditation for the analysis of chlorinated hydrocarbons, all analytical results for the residue class must collectively satisfy the criteria. [Conformance to criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will only be determined when six or more analytical results with associated comparison means at or above the logarithm of the minimum proficiency level are available.]</P>
            <P>(3) Round all check sample statistical computations to the nearest tenth, except where otherwise noted.</P>
            <P>(4) Complete a second set of the requisite number of check samples if the results of the first set of check samples do not meet the criteria for obtaining accreditation.</P>
            <P>(i) The second set of check samples will be provided within 30 days following the date of receipt by FSIS of a request from the applying laboratory. The second set of food chemistry check samples will be analyzed for only the analyte(s) for which unacceptable initial results had been obtained by the laboratory.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the results of the second set of check samples do not meet the criteria for obtaining accreditation, the laboratory may reapply after a 60-day waiting period, commencing from the date of refusal of accreditation by FSIS. At that time, a new application, all fees, and all documentation of corrective action required for accreditation must be submitted.</P>
            <P>(5) Allow inspection of the laboratory by FSIS officials prior to the determination of granting accredited status.</P>
            <P>(6) Pay the accreditation fee by the date required.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Quality assurance levels</E>—(1) <E T="03">Systematic laboratory difference:</E> The absolute value of the average standardized difference must not exceed the following:</P>
            <P>(i) For food chemistry, 0.73 minus the product of 0.17 and the standard deviation of the standardized differences; and</P>
            <P>(ii) For chemical residues, 1.67 (2.00 if there are less than 12 analytical results) minus the product of 0.29 and the standard deviation of the standardized differences.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Variability:</E> The estimated standard deviation of the standardized difference must not exceed the following:</P>
            <P>(i) For food chemistry, 1.15; and</P>
            <P>(ii) For chemical residues, a computed limit that is a function of the number of analytical results used in the computation of the standard deviation, and of the amount of variability.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Individual large deviations:</E> One hundred times the average of the large deviation measures of the individual samples must be less than 5.0. A result will have a large deviation measure equal to zero when the absolute value of the result's standardized difference, (d), is less than 2.5 and otherwise a measure equal to 1-(2.5/d).</P>
            <P>(4) For residue analyses, the following additional quality assurance requirements must be met.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">QA recovery:</E> The average of the QA recoveries of the individual check sample analytical results must lie within ranges established by FSIS.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">QC recovery:</E> All QC recoveries must lie within ranges established by FSIS. Supporting documentation must be made available to FSIS upon request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for maintaining accreditation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To maintain accreditation, an analytical laboratory must fulfill the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Official samples.</E> (1) An accredited laboratory must expeditiously report analytical results, in the analyte category for which accreditation was granted, of official samples on designated forms to the Data Center Staff, USDA/FSIS Eastern Laboratory, Russell Research Center, P.O. Box 6085, Athens, GA 30604 (for U.S. Postal Service delivery), or Data Center Staff, USDA/FSIS Eastern Laboratory, Russell Research Center, 950 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605 (for commercial carrier delivery). When so provided for by FSIS, analytical results may be reported to the Data Center Staff by facsimile at (706) 546-3589, or electronically. The Federal inspector at any establishment may assign the analysis of official samples to an FSIS laboratory if, in the inspector's judgment, there are delays in receiving test results on official samples from an accredited laboratory.</P>
            <P>(2) Every QC recovery associated with reporting of official samples must lie within ranges established by FSIS. Supporting documentation must be made available to FSIS upon request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Records.</E> An accredited laboratory must:</P>
            <P>(1) Maintain laboratory quality control records for the most recent three years that samples have been analyzed under this Program.</P>
            <P>(2) Maintain complete records of the receipt, analysis, and disposition of official samples for the most recent three years that samples have been analyzed under this Program.</P>
            <P>(3) Maintain in a secure electronic format or in a standards book, which is preferably a permanently bound book with sequentially numbered pages, all records, readings, and calculations for standard solutions. All entries are to be dated and signed by the analyst immediately upon completion of the entry, and by the supervisor, or in the absence of the supervisor by the supervisor's designee, before use of the standard solution but no later than within one week. The standards book is to be retained for three years after the last recorded entry.</P>
            <P>(4) Maintain records and supervisor approvals of recoveries, and of instrument maintenance and calibration. The records are to be retained for three years after the last recorded entry.</P>
            <P>(5) As provided in paragraph (f) of this section, records should be available for review by any duly authorized representative of the Secretary of Agriculture, including ALP personnel or their designees.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Check samples.</E> (1) An accredited laboratory must analyze interlaboratory accreditation maintenance check samples and return the results to FSIS within three weeks of sample receipt. This must be done whenever requested by FSIS and at no cost to FSIS.</P>
            <P>(2) Results must be those of the accredited laboratory. Analyses of maintenance check samples shall not be contracted out by the accredited laboratory.</P>
            <P>(3) As provided by the requirements in paragraph (h) of this section, a check sample report will be considered complete only if laboratories report all analytes present in the check sample for the analyte category in which accreditation was granted.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Corporate changes.</E> The ALP must be informed within 30 days of any change of address or in the laboratory's ownership, officers, directors, supervisory personnel, or other responsibly connected individual or entity.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">On-site review.</E> An accredited laboratory must permit any duly authorized representative of the Secretary to perform both announced and unannounced on-site laboratory reviews of facilities and records, both hard copy and electronic, during normal business hours, and to copy any records pertaining to the laboratory's participation in the ALP.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Analytical procedures.</E> An accredited laboratory must use analytical procedures designated by the FSIS ALP as being acceptable.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Quality assurance levels.</E> (1) An accredited laboratory must demonstrate an ability to maintain quality assurance levels that are within acceptable limits for systematic laboratory difference, variability, and individual large deviations in the analysis of <PRTPAGE P="624"/>interlaboratory check samples for the analyte category for which accreditation was granted. An accredited laboratory will successfully demonstrate the maintenance of these capabilities if its analytical results from interlaboratory accreditation maintenance check samples satisfy the criteria presented in this paragraph (h). All statistical computations are to be rounded to the nearest tenth, except where otherwise noted.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition, a laboratory accredited for a specific chemical residue or a chemical residue class:</P>
            <P>(i) Must satisfy criteria presented in this paragraph for chemical residue recoveries and proper identification;</P>
            <P>(ii) Must demonstrate the maintenance of its capabilities by reporting its analytical results for each specific chemical residue found above the minimum proficiency level; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Must, if accredited for the analysis of chlorinated hydrocarbons, obtain analytical results that collectively satisfy the criteria.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Systematic laboratory difference:</E> The standardized difference between the accredited laboratory's result and the comparison mean for each interlaboratory accreditation maintenance check sample is used to determine two CUSUM values, designated as CUSUM-P and CUSUM-N.</P>
            <P>(i) When determining compliance with this criterion for all chlorinated hydrocarbon results in a sample collectively, the following statistical procedure must be followed to account for the correlation of analytical results within a sample: The average of the standardized differences of the analytical results within the sample, divided by a constant, is used in place of a single standardized difference to determine the CUSUM-P (or CUSUM-N) value for the sample. The constant is a function of the number of analytical results used to compute the average standardized difference.</P>
            <P>(ii) Positive systematic laboratory difference: This value is computed and evaluated as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) Determine the CUSUM-P increment for the sample.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The CUSUM-P increment for food chemistry, as defined in § 439.1 of this part, is set equal to:</P>
            <P>2.0, if the standardized difference is greater than 2.4,</P>
            <P>−2.0, if the standardized difference is less than −1.6, or</P>
            <P>the standardized difference minus 0.4, if the standardized difference lies between −1.6 and 2.4, inclusive.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The CUSUM-P increment for chemical residues is set equal to:</P>
            <P>2.0, if the standardized difference is greater than 2.5,</P>
            <P>−2.0, if the standardized difference is less than −1.5, or</P>
            <P>the standardized difference minus 0.5, if the standardized difference lies between −1.5 and 2.5, inclusive.</P>
            <P>(B) Compute the new CUSUM-P value. The new CUSUM-P value is obtained by adding, algebraically, the CUSUM-P increment to the last previously computed CUSUM-P value. If this computation yields a value smaller than 0, the new CUSUM-P value is set equal to 0.</P>
            <P>(C) Evaluate the new CUSUM-P value. The new CUSUM-P value must not exceed:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) 5.2 for food chemistry.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) 4.8 for chemical residues.</P>
            <P>(iii) Negative systematic laboratory difference: This value is computed and evaluated as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) Determine the CUSUM-N increment for the sample.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The CUSUM-N increment for food chemistry is set equal to:</P>
            <P>2.0, if the standardized difference is greater than 1.6,</P>
            <P>−2.0, if the standardized difference is less than −2.4, or</P>
            <P>the standardized difference plus 0.4, if the standardized difference lies between −2.4 and 1.6, inclusive.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The CUSUM-N increment for chemical residues is set equal to:</P>
            <P>2.0, if the standardized difference is greater than 1.5,</P>
            <P>−2.0, if the standardized difference is less than −2.5, or</P>
            <P>the standardized difference plus 0.5, if the standardized difference lies between −2.5 and 1.5, inclusive.</P>

            <P>(B) Compute the new CUSUM-N value. The new CUSUM-N value is obtained by subtracting, algebraically, the CUSUM-N increment from the last previously computed CUSUM-N value. If this computation yields a value <PRTPAGE P="625"/>smaller than 0, the new CUSUM-N value is set equal to 0.</P>
            <P>(C) Evaluate the new CUSUM-N value. The new CUSUM-N value must not exceed:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) 5.2 for food chemistry.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) 4.8 for chemical residues.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Variability:</E> The absolute value of the standardized difference between the accredited laboratory's result and the comparison mean for each interlaboratory accreditation maintenance check sample is used to determine a CUSUM value, designated as CUSUM-V.</P>
            <P>(i) When determining compliance with this criterion for all chlorinated hydrocarbon results in a sample collectively, the following statistical procedure must be followed to account for the correlation of analytical results within a sample: The square root of the sum of the within sample variance and the average standardized difference of the sample, divided by a constant, is used in place of the absolute value of the standardized difference to determine the CUSUM-V value for the sample. The constant is a function of the number of analytical results used to compute the average standardized difference.</P>
            <P>(ii) The variability value is computed and designated as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) Determine the CUSUM-V increment for the sample. The CUSUM increment is set equal to the larger of −0.4 or the absolute value of the standardized difference minus 0.9. If this computation yields a value larger than 1.6, the increment is set equal to 1.6.</P>
            <P>(B) Compute the new CUSUM-V value. The new CUSUM-V value is obtained by adding, algebraically, the CUSUM-V increment to the last previously computed CUSUM-V value. If this computation yields a value less than 0, the new CUSUM-V value is set equal to 0.</P>
            <P>(C) Evaluate the new CUSUM-V value. The new CUSUM-V value must not exceed 4.3.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Large deviations:</E> The large deviation measure of the accredited laboratory's result for each interlaboratory accreditation maintenance check sample is used to determine a CUSUM value, designated as CUSUM-D.</P>
            <P>(i) A result will have a large deviation measure equal to zero when the absolute value of the result's standardized difference, (d), is less than 2.5, and otherwise a measure equal to 1−(2.5/d).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 441.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Retained water.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Raw livestock, poultry, and fish carcasses and parts will not be permitted to retain water resulting from post-evisceration processing unless the establishment preparing those carcasses and parts demonstrates to FSIS, with data collected in accordance with a written protocol, that any water retained in the carcasses or parts is an unavoidable consequence of the process used to meet applicable food safety requirements.</P>

            <P>(b) Raw livestock, poultry, and fish carcasses and parts that retain water from post-evisceration processing and that are sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, must bear a statement on the label in prominent letters and contiguous to the product name or elsewhere on the principal display panel of the label stating the maximum percentage of water that may be retained (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “up to X% retained water,” “less than X% retained water,” “up to X% water added from processing”). The percent water statement need not accompany the product name on other parts of the label. Raw livestock and poultry carcasses and parts that retain no water may bear a statement that no water is retained.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) An establishment subject to paragraph (a) of this section must maintain on file and available to FSIS its written data-collection protocol. The protocol must explain how data will be collected and used to demonstrate the amount of retained water in the product covered by the protocol that is an unavoidable consequence of the process used to meet specified food safety requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) The establishment must notify FSIS as soon as it has a new or revised protocol available for review by the Agency. Within 30 days after receipt of this notification, FSIS may object to or require the establishment to make changes in the protocol.</P>
            <P>(d) Expected elements of a protocol for gathering water retention data:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Purpose statement.</E> The primary purpose of the protocol should be to determine the amount or percentage of water absorption and retention that is unavoidable using a particular chilling system while achieving the regulatory pathogen reduction performance standard for <E T="03">Salmonella</E> as set forth in the PR/HACCP regulations (9 CFR 310.25(b), 381.94(b)) and the time/temperature requirements set forth in 9 CFR 381.66. Additional purposes that could be included are determining chilling system efficiency and evaluating product quality.<PRTPAGE P="628"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Type of washing and chilling system used by the establishment.</E> Any post-evisceration washing or chilling processes that affect water retention levels in and microbial loads on raw products should be described. For poultry establishments, the main chiller types, identified by the mechanism used to transport the birds through the chiller or to agitate the water in the chiller, are the drag-through, the screw type, and the rocker-arm type.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Configuration and any modifications of the chiller system components.</E> A description of chiller-system configurations and modifications should be provided. The description should include the number and type of chillers in a series and arrangements of chilling system components, and the number of evisceration lines feeding into a chiller system. If there is a pre-chilling step in the process, its purpose and the type of equipment used should be accurately described. Any mechanical or design changes made to the chilling equipment should be described.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Special features in the chilling process.</E> Any special features in the chilling process, such as antimicrobial treatments, should be described. Also, the length and velocity of the dripping line should be described, as well as the total time allowed for dripping. Any special apparatus, such as a mechanism for squeezing excessive water from chilled birds, should be explained.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Description of variable factors in the chilling system.</E> The protocol should describe variable factors that affect water absorption and retention. In poultry processing, such factors are typically considered to be the time in chiller water, the water temperature, and agitation. The protocol should consider air agitation, where applicable. Additional factors that may affect water absorption and retention are scalding temperature and the pressure or amount of buffeting applied to birds by feather removal machinery, and the resultant loosening of the skin. Another factor that should be considered is the method used to open the bird for evisceration.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Standards to be met by the chilling system.</E> For example, the chilling system may be designed simply to achieve a reduction in temperature of ready-to-cook poultry to less than 40 °F within the time limit specified by the regulations, or in less time. As to the standard for pathogen minimization, the <E T="03">Salmonella</E> pathogen reduction standards, as set forth in the PR/HACCP final rule, have been suggested. Although there is not yet an applicable <E T="03">Salmonella</E> standard for turkeys, establishments are free to adopt practicable criteria for use in gathering data on turkeys under the protocols here suggested. Additional microbiological targets, such as <E T="03">E. coli</E> or <E T="03">Campylobacter</E> levels, or reductions in numbers of other microorganisms, may also be used.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Testing methods to be employed.</E> The protocol should detail the testing methods to be used both for measuring water absorption and retention and for sampling and testing product for pathogen reductions. The protocol should call for water retention and pathogen reduction tests at various chilling equipment settings and chilling time-and-temperature combinations. The method to be used in calculating water absorption and retention should be reproducible and statistically verifiable. With respect to the pathogen-reduction aspect of the testing, FSIS recommends the methods used for <E T="03">E. coli</E> and <E T="03">Salmonella</E> testing under the PR/HACCP regulations. The number of samples, the type of samples, the sampling time period, and the type of testing or measurement should be included in the protocol.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Reporting of data and evaluation of results.</E> The protocol should explain how data obtained are to be reported and summarized. The criteria for evaluating the results and the basis for conclusions to be drawn should be explained.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Conclusions.</E> The protocol should provide for a statement of what the data obtained demonstrate and what conclusions were reached.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Labels required; supervision of a Program employee.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General labeling requirements.</E> The requirements in part 317, subpart A, of this chapter, governing labels and labeling, safe-handling labeling, abbreviations of official marks, the use of approved labels, the labeling of products for foreign commerce, prohibited practices, the reuse of official inspection marks, filling of containers, relabeling of products, the storage and distribution of labels, and the requirements for packaging materials, apply to fish and fish products.</P>
            <P>(b) A country of origin statement on the label of any fish “covered commodity” as defined in 7 CFR part 60, subpart A, that is sold by a “retailer,” as defined in 7 CFR 60.124, must comply with the requirements of 7 CFR 60.200 and 60.300.</P>
            <P>(c) The safe handling instructions required on labels of fish and fish products specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall replace statements that include the terms “meat” and “poultry” with the following:</P>

            <P>(1) In the rationale statement, “This product was prepared from inspected <PRTPAGE P="646"/>and passed fish. Some food products may contain bacteria that could cause illness if the product is mishandled and cooked improperly. For your protection, follow these safe handling instructions.” This statement shall be placed immediately after the heading and before the safe handling statements.</P>
            <P>(2) In the labeling statements, “Keep raw fish separate from other foods. Wash working surfaces (including cutting boards), utensils, and hands after touching raw fish. (A graphic illustration of soapy hands under a faucet shall be displayed next to statement.)”</P>

            <P>(d)(1) Labels and labeling of fish in the order Siluriformes and the products of those fish must bear the appropriate common or usual names of the fish. For example, among fish in the family Pangasiidae, the labels and labeling for fish of the species <E T="03">Pangasius bocourti</E> must bear the term “basa”; for the species <E T="03">Pangasius hypophthalmus</E> or <E T="03">Pangasionodon hypophthalmus,</E> “swai,” “tra,” or “sutchi.”</P>
            <P>(2) The labels and labeling only of fish and fish products within the family Icataluridae may bear the term “catfish.”</P>
            <P>(e) The requirements in part 441 of this chapter, governing water retained from processing in raw meat and poultry, apply to retained water in fish. The requirements in part 442 of this chapter, governing quantity of contents labeling, the testing of scales, and the handling of product that is found to be out of compliance with net weight requirements, apply to fish and fish products.</P>
            <P>(1) Packages of frozen or fresh-frozen fish carcasses or parts must be labeled to reflect 100-percent net weight after thawing. The de-glazed net weight must average 100 percent of the stated net weight of the frozen product when sampled and weighed according to the method prescribed in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 133 Chapter 2, Section 2.6.<SU>1</SU>

            <P>(b) No person, engaged in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for commerce, fish products capable of use as human food, or importing such articles, shall transport, offer for transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce or in any State designated under § 560.3 of this subchapter, any fish product which is capable of use as human food and is not wrapped, packaged, or otherwise enclosed to prevent adulteration by airborne contaminants, unless the railroad car, truck, or other means of conveyance in which the product is contained or transported is completely enclosed with tight fitting doors or other covers for all openings. In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated.</P>
            <P>(c) Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must be thoroughly removed from the means of conveyance prior to its use. Such means of conveyance onto which product is loaded, being loaded, or intended to be loaded, shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at any official establishment.</P>
            <P>(d) The decision whether or not to inspect a means of conveyance in a specific case, and the type and extent of such inspection shall be at the Agency's discretion and shall be adequate to determine if fish product in such conveyance is, or when moved could become, adulterated.</P>
            <P>(e) Circumstances of transport that can be reasonably anticipated shall be considered in making said determination. These include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, duration and distance of trip, nature of product covering, and effect of restowage at stops en route. Any means of conveyance found upon such inspection to be in such condition that fish product placed therein could become adulterated shall not be used until such condition which could cause adulteration is corrected.</P>
            <P>Fish product placed in any means of conveyance that is found by the inspector to be in such condition that the fish product may have become adulterated shall be removed from the means of conveyance and handled in accordance with part 539 or § 540.3 of this subchapter.</P>

              <P>When operations in an official plant require the services of inspection personnel beyond their regularly assigned tour of duty on any day or on a day outside the established schedule, such services are considered as overtime <PRTPAGE P="670"/>work. The official plant must give reasonable advance notice to the inspector of any overtime service necessary and must pay for such overtime. For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the overtime rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, multiplied by 1.5, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt rate using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b) and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c) of this chapter.</P>

The official plant must, in advance of such holiday work, request the inspector in charge to furnish inspection service during such period and must pay the Agency for such holiday work at the hourly rate. For each calendar year, FSIS calculates the holiday rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS will calculate the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt rate using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b), and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) The term “holiday” shall mean the legal public holidays specified by the Congress in paragraph (a) of section 6103, title 5 of the United States Code. Information on legal holidays may be obtained from the supervisor.</P>

              <P>Overtime and/or holiday services shall be billed to the official plant on the basis of each 15 minutes of overtime and/or holiday service performed by each inspector providing such service to the plant, except that when an official plant requires the services of an inspector after he has completed his day's assignment and left the plant or when he is called back to duty on a day outside the established normal operating schedule or on a holiday, the official plant shall pay for a minimum of 2 hours service at the applicable established rate. Extra travel expense incurred while rendering overtime or holiday service shall be billed to the official plant. Bills are payable upon receipt and become delinquent 30 days from date of billing. Overtime or holiday inspection service will not be performed at any plant that is delinquent, and processing operations shall be confined to the regular operating schedule of the plant. In addition, fees will be charged and collected for certifications requested by and provided for the official plant that are not within the scope of these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Refusal, suspension, or withdrawal of service.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator (for such period, or indefinitely, as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act) may refuse to provide or may withdraw inspection service under this part with respect to any plant if he determines after opportunity for a hearing (following the procedures of 7 CFR, part 1, subpart H) is accorded to the applicant for, or recipient of, such service, that such applicant or recipient is unfit to engage in any business requiring inspection under the Act or this part, because the applicant or recipient or anyone responsibly connected with such person has been convicted in any Federal or State court, within the previous 10 years, of (1) any felony or more than one misdemeanor under any law based upon the acquiring, handling, or distributing of adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged food or fraud in connection with transactions in food or (2) any felony, involving, fraud, bribery, extortion, or any other act or circumstances indicating a lack of the integrity needed for the conduct of operations affecting the public health.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to be responsibly connected with the business if he is a partner, officer, director, holder, or owner of 10 percentum or more of its voting stock, or employee in a managerial or executive capacity.</P>
              <P>(c) The determination and order of the Administrator with respect thereto under this section shall be final and conclusive unless the affected applicant for, or recipient of, inspection service files application for judicial review within 30 days after the effective date of such order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such applicant or recipient has its principal place of business or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Judicial review of any such order shall be upon the record upon which the determination and order are based. The provisions of section 204 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended (7 U.S.C. 194) shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section. This section shall not affect in any way other provisions of the Act or these regulations for refusal of inspection services.</P>

              <P>(d) Any applicant for inspection at a plant where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters in the United States is required by subsection 401(a)(1) (33 U.S.C. 1341) of the Clean Water Act as amended (86 Stat. 816, 91 Stat. 1566; 33 U.S.C. 1251 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), to provide the Administrator with a certification, as prescribed in said subsection, that any such discharge will comply with the <PRTPAGE P="674"/>applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1311, 1312, 1313, 1316, and 1317). No grant of inspection can be issued unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived, because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act on a request for certification within a reasonable period (which shall not exceed 1 year after receipt of such request). Further, upon receipt of an application for inspection and a certification as required by subsection 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, the Administrator (as defined in § 590.5) is required by subparagraph (2) of said subsection to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for proceedings in accordance with that subsection. No grant of inspection can be made until the requirements of 401(a) (1) and (2) have been met.</P>
              <P>(e) Inspection may be suspended or revoked and plant approval terminated as provided in subsection 401(a) (4) and (5) of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1341(a) (4) and (5)).</P>
              <P>(f) Suspension of plant approval and withdrawal of service:</P>
              <P>(1) Any plant approval given pursuant to these regulations may be suspended by the Administrator for (i) failure to maintain premises, facilities, and equipment in a satisfactory state of repair; (ii) the use of operating procedures or practices which are not in accordance with the regulations; (iii) the alterations of buildings, facilities, or equipment which have not been approved in accordance with the regulations; or (iv) assaulting, intimidating, impeding, obstructing, or interfering with any person engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties.</P>
              <P>(2) During such period of suspension, no processing of egg products for commerce shall be carried on in the official plant. If the plant facilities or methods of operation are not brought into compliance within a reasonable period of time, to be specified by the Administrator, inspection service shall be withdrawn from the official plant. Upon withdrawal of inspection service in an official plant, the plant approval for processing egg products shall also become terminated.</P>
              <P>(3) The operator shall be notified of the withdrawal action and the reasons therefor and afforded an opportunity to present his views informally prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, and upon written request, he shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR, part 1, subpart H), with respect to the merits or validity of the withdrawal, but such a suspension or other withdrawal shall continue in effect pending the outcome of any such hearing unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(4) In any case where inspection service is suspended under this paragraph (f) of this section, such service, after appropriate corrective action is taken, will be restored immediately, or as soon thereafter as an inspector can be made available. In any case where inspection service is withdrawn for a specified period under this paragraph (f) of this section, the person concerned may, after said specified period has expired, apply for inspection service as provided in §§ 590.140 through 590.146.</P>

Any label, container, or packaging material which bears any official identification shall be used only in such manner as the Administrator may prescribe. No label, container, or packaging material bearing official identification may be used unless it is approved by the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The use of finished labels must be approved as prescribed by the Administrator. If the label is printed on or otherwise applied directly to the container or packaging material, the principal display panel thereof shall be considered as the label.</P>

              <P>(b) No label, container, or packaging material bearing official identification may be printed or prepared for use until the printers' or other final proof has been approved by the Administrator in accordance with the regulations in this part, the Egg Products Inspection Act, the Federal Food, Drug, <PRTPAGE P="679"/>and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts. Copies of each label submitted for approval shall be accompanied by:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement showing by their common or usual names the kinds and percentages of the ingredients comprising the egg product. A range may be given in cases where the percentages may vary from time to time. Formulas are to be expressed in terms of a liquid product except for products which are dry blended. Also, for products to be dried, the label may show the ingredients in the order of descending proportions by weight in the dried form. However, the formula submitted must include the percentage of ingredients in both liquid and dried form.</P>
              <P>(2) When required, scientific data demonstrating that the substance or mixture is safe and effective for its intended use and does not promote deception or cause the product to be otherwise adulterated or misbranded.</P>
              <P>(c) Containers of product bearing official identification shall display the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The common or usual name, if any, and if the product is comprised of two or more ingredients, such ingredients shall be listed in the order of descending proportions by weight in the form in which the product is to be marketed (sold), except that ingredients in dried products (other than dry blended) may be listed in either liquid or dried form. When water (excluding that used to reconstitute dehydrated ingredients back to their normal composition) is added to a liquid or frozen egg product or to an ingredient of such products (in excess of the normal water content of that ingredient), the total amount of water added, including the water content of any cellulose or vegetable gums used, shall be expressed as a percentage of the total product weight in the ingredient statement on the label.</P>
              <P>(2) The name, address, and ZIP code of the packer or distributor. When the distributor is shown, it shall be qualified by such terms as “packed for,” “distributed by,” or “distributors”;</P>
              <P>(3) The lot number or approved alternative code number indicating date of production;</P>
              <P>(4) The net contents;</P>
              <P>(5) Official identification and plant number;</P>
              <P>(6) Egg products which are produced in an official plant from edible shell eggs of other than current production or from other egg products produced from shell eggs of other than current production, shall be clearly and distinctly labeled in close proximity to the common or usual name of the product, e.g., “Manufactured from eggs of other than current production”;</P>
              <P>(7) Egg products produced from edible shell eggs or the egg product produced from such shell eggs of the turkey, duck, goose, or guinea shall be clearly and distinctly labeled as to the common or usual name of the product indicating the type of eggs or egg products used in the product, e.g., “Frozen whole turkey eggs,” “Frozen whole chicken and turkey eggs.” Egg products labeled without qualifying words as to the type of shell egg used in the product shall be produced only from the edible shell egg of the domesticated chicken or the egg product produced from such shell eggs.</P>
              <P>(d) Liquid or frozen egg products identified as whole eggs and prepared other than in natural proportions, as broken from the shell, shall have a total egg solids content of 24.20 percent or greater.</P>
              <P>(e) Nutrition information may be included on labels used to identify egg products, providing such labeling complies with the provisions of 21 CFR part 101, promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Since these regulations have different requirements for consumer packaged products than for bulk packaged egg products not for sale or distribution to household consumers, label submission shall be accompanied with information indicating whether the label covers consumer packaged or bulk packaged product. Nutrition labeling is required when nutrients, such as proteins, vitamins, and minerals are added to the product, or when a nutritional claim or information is presented on the labeling, except for the following which are exempt from nutrition labeling requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) Egg products shipped in bulk form for use solely in the manufacture of <PRTPAGE P="680"/>other food and not for distribution to household consumers in such bulk form or containers.</P>

              <P>(2) Products containing an added vitamin, mineral, or protein, or for which a nutritional claim is made on the label, or in advertising, which is supplied for institutional food use only: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the manufacturer or distributor provides the required nutrition information directly to those institutions.</P>
              <P>(3) Any nutrient(s) included in product solely for technological purpose may be declared solely in the ingredients statement, without complying with nutrition labeling, if the nutrient(s) is otherwise not referred to in labeling or in advertising. All labels showing nutrition information or claims are subject to review by the Food and Drug Administration prior to approval by the Department.</P>
              <P>(f) If the Administrator has reason to believe that the statement on formulation shows the product to be adulterated or misbranded or that any labeling, or the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use in respect to egg products at any official plant is false or misleading in any way, he may direct that such use be withheld unless the labeling or container is modified in such a manner as he may prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading, and/or the formulation of the product is altered in such a manner that he may prescribe so that it is not adulterated, or would not cause misbranding. Any person so denied the approval of any label shall be notified promptly of the reasons for the denial on a form approved by the Administrator. If the person using or proposing to use the label does not accept the determination of the Administrator, he may request a hearing by filing with the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the notice of denial, a written application for a hearing setting forth specifically, the errors alleged to have been made by the Administrator in denying approval of the label. The use of the label shall be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the Administrator if the Administrator so directs. Hearings held pursuant to this subsection shall be presided at by the Administrator. The applicant shall be given the opportunity to present evidence both oral and written in support of his allegation that the Administrator erred in denying approval of the label. The notice of denial together with all other available data and information used as a basis for such denial shall be considered part of the record. The Administrator may take official notice of such matters as are judicially noticed by the Courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character. The Administrator shall make his final determination with respect to the matter upon the basis of evidence before him. Such determination shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after the receipt of notice of such final determination, the person adversely affected thereby appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he has his principal place of business, or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The provisions of section 204 of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, as amended, shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.</P>

              <P>(a) Whenever it is determined by the Administrator that the system of egg products inspection maintained by any foreign country is such that the egg products produced in such country are processed, labeled, and packaged in accordance with, and otherwise comply with, the standards of the Act and these regulations including, but not limited to the same sanitary, processing, facility requirements, and continuous Government inspection as required in §§ 590.500 through 590.580 applicable to inspected articles produced within the United States, notice of that fact will be given according to paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, egg products from such countries shall be eligible for importation into the United States, subject to the provisions of this part and other applicable laws and regulations. Such products must meet, to the extent applicable, the same standards and requirements that apply to comparable domestic products as set forth in these regulations. Egg products from foreign countries not deemed eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section are not eligible for importation into the United States, except as provided by § 590.960. In determining if the inspection system of a foreign country is the equivalent of the system maintained by the United States, the Administrator shall review the inspection regulations of the foreign country and make a survey to determine the manner in which the inspection system is administered within the foreign country. The survey of the foreign inspection system may be expedited by payment by the interested Government agency in the foreign country of the travel expenses incurred in making the survey. After approval of the inspection system of a foreign country, the Administrator may, as often and to the extent deemed necessary, authorize representatives of the Department to review the system to determine that it is maintained in such a manner as to be the equivalent of the system maintained by the United States.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basetime rate.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the basetime rate for inspection services, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of <PRTPAGE P="717"/>Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by the previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate.</P>
              <P>(b) FSIS will calculate the benefits, travel and operating, overhead, and allowance for bad debt rate components of the basetime rate, using the following formulas:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's direct benefits costs by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday), plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan basic and matching contributions.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Travel and operating rate.</E> The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's total direct travel and operating costs by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday), plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of inflation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Overhead rate.</E> The quotient of dividing the previous fiscal year's indirect costs plus the previous fiscal year's information technology (IT) costs in the Public Health Data Communication Infrastructure System Fund plus the previous fiscal year's Office of Management Program cost in the Reimbursable and Voluntary Funds plus the provision for the operating balance less any Greenbook costs (i.e., costs of USDA support services prorated to the service component for which fees are charged) that are not related to food inspection, by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked across all funds, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of inflation.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Previous fiscal year's allowance for bad debt (for example, debt owed that is not paid in full by plants and establishments that declare bankruptcy) divided by the previous fiscal year's total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
              <P>(c) The calendar year's cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Overtime rate.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When operations in an official plant require the services of inspection personnel beyond their regularly assigned tour of duty on any day or on a day outside the established schedule, such services are considered as overtime work. The official plant must give reasonable advance notice to the inspector of any overtime service necessary. For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the overtime rate for inspection service, per hour per program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase multiplied by 1.5, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b), and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c).</P>

              <P>When an official plant requires inspection service on a holiday or a day designated in lieu of a holiday, such service is considered holiday work. The official plant must, in advance of such holiday work, request that the inspector in charge furnish inspection services during such period and must pay the Agency for such holiday work at the hourly rate. For each calendar year, FSIS will calculate the holiday rate for inspection service, per hour per <PRTPAGE P="718"/>program employee, using the following formula: The quotient of dividing the Office of Field Operations plus Office of International Affairs inspection program personnel's previous fiscal year's regular direct pay by previous fiscal year's regular hours, plus the quotient multiplied by the calendar year's percentage of cost of living increase, multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus the travel and operating rate, plus the overhead rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. FSIS calculates the benefits rate, the travel and operating rate, the overhead rate, and the allowance for bad debt using the formulas set forth in § 592.510(b), and the cost of living increases and percentage of inflation factors set forth in § 592.510(c).</P>
