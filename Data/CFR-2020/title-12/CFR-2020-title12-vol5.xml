      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Final action may be withheld until the FDIC has assurance that permission to organize the proposed institution will be granted by the chartering authority.

              <P>For purposes of this subpart:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Branch</E>, except as provided in this paragraph, includes any branch bank, branch office, additional office, or any branch place of business located in any State of the United States or in any territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands at which deposits are received or checks paid or money lent. A branch does not include an automated teller machine, an automated loan machine, a remote service unit, or a facility described in section 303.46. The term branch also includes the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A <E T="03">messenger service</E> that is operated by a bank or its affiliate that picks up and delivers items relating to transactions in which deposits are received or checks paid or money lent. A messenger service established and operated by a non-affiliated third party generally does not constitute a branch for purposes of this subpart. Banks contracting with third parties to provide messenger services should consult with the FDIC to determine if the messenger service constitutes a branch.</P>
              <P>(2) A <E T="03">mobile branch,</E> other than a messenger service, that does not have a single, permanent site and uses a vehicle that travels to various locations to enable the public to conduct banking business. A mobile branch may serve defined locations on a regular schedule or may serve a defined area at varying times and locations.</P>
              <P>(3) A <E T="03">temporary branch</E> that operates for a limited period of time not to exceed one year as a public service, such as during an emergency or disaster situation.</P>
              <P>(4) A <E T="03">seasonal branch</E> that operates at various periodically recurring intervals, such as during state and local fairs, college registration periods, and other similar occasions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Branch relocation</E> means a move within the same immediate neighborhood of the existing branch that does not substantially affect the nature of the business of the branch or the customers of the branch. Moving a branch to a location outside its immediate neighborhood is considered the closing of an existing branch and the establishment of a new branch. Closing of a branch is covered in the FDIC Statement of Policy Concerning Branch Closing Notices and Policies. 1 FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts 5391; see § 309.4 (a) and (b) of this chapter for availability.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">De novo branch</E> means a branch of a bank which is established by the bank as a branch and does not become a branch of such bank as a result of:</P>
              <P>(1) The acquisition by the bank of an insured depository institution or a branch of an insured depository institution; or</P>
              <P>(2) The conversion, merger, or consolidation of any such institution or branch.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Home state</E> means the state by which the bank is chartered.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Host state</E> means a state, other than the home state of the bank, in which the bank maintains, or seeks to establish and maintain, a branch.</P>

              <P>(1) Any merger transaction, including any corporate reorganization, interim merger transaction, or optional conversion, in which the resulting institution is to be an insured state nonmember bank; and</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposit insurance.</E> An application for deposit insurance will be required in connection with a merger transaction between a state-chartered interim institution and an insured depository institution if the related merger application is being acted upon by a federal banking agency other than the FDIC. If the FDIC is the federal banking agency responsible for acting on the related merger application, a separate application for deposit insurance is not necessary. Procedures for applying for deposit insurance are set forth in subpart B of this part. An application for deposit insurance will not be required in connection with a merger transaction (other than a purchase and assumption transaction) of a federally-chartered interim institution and an insured institution, even if the resulting institution is to operate under the charter of the federal interim institution.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Branch closings.</E> Branch closings in connection with a merger transaction are subject to the notice requirements of section 42 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831r-1), including requirements for notice to customers. These requirements are addressed in the “Interagency Policy Statement Concerning Branch Closings Notices and Policies” (1 FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts (FDIC) 5391; see § 309.4(a) and (b) of this chapter for availability.)</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Undercapitalized institutions.</E> Applications for a merger transaction by applicants subject to section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831<E T="03">o</E>) should also provide the information required by § 303.204. Applications pursuant to sections 38 and 18(c) of the FDI Act (12 <PRTPAGE P="23"/>U.S.C, 1831<E T="03">o</E> and 1828(c)) may be filed concurrently or as a single application.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Certification of assumption of deposit liability.</E> An insured depository institution assuming deposit liabilities of another insured institution must provide certification of assumption of deposit liability to the FDIC in accordance with 12 CFR part 307.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Convertible securities, options, and warrants.</E> The acquisition of convertible securities, or options or warrants to acquire voting securities is presumed to constitute the acquisition of voting securities.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General considerations.</E> The FDIC shall review the notice and other materials submitted by the institution proposing to convert from mutual to stock form, specifically considering the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) The proposed use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as set forth in the business plan;</P>
              <P>(2) The adequacy of the disclosure materials;</P>
              <P>(3) The participation of depositors in approving the transaction;</P>
              <P>(4) The form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members on the conversion;</P>

              <P>(5) Any proposed increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights and other similar benefits) to be granted to officers and directors/trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion;<PRTPAGE P="36"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) The adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining the price of the shares of stock to be sold;</P>
              <P>(7) The process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock, and the proposed compensation arrangements for insiders;</P>
              <P>(8) The nature and apportionment of stock subscription rights; and</P>
              <P>(9) The bank's plans to fulfill its commitment to serving the convenience and needs of its community.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional considerations.</E> (1) In reviewing the notice and other materials submitted under this subpart, the FDIC will take into account the extent to which the proposed conversion transaction conforms with the various provisions of the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (12 CFR part 563b), as currently in effect at the time the notice is submitted. Any non-conformity with those provisions will be closely reviewed.</P>
              <P>(2) Conformity with the OTS requirements will not be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes if the FDIC determines that the proposed conversion transaction would pose a risk to the bank's safety or soundness, violate any law or regulation, or present a breach of fiduciary duty.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice period.</E> (1) The period in which the FDIC may object to the proposed conversion transaction shall be the later of:</P>
              <P>(i) 60 days after receipt of a substantially complete notice of proposed conversion; or</P>
              <P>(ii) 20 days after the last applicable state or other federal regulator has approved the proposed conversion.</P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC may, in its discretion, extend the initial 60-day period for up to an additional 60 days by providing written notice to the institution.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Letter of non-objection.</E> If the FDIC determines, in its discretion, that the proposed conversion transaction would not pose a risk to the institution's safety or soundness, violate any law or regulation, or present a breach of fiduciary duty, then the FDIC shall issue to the institution proposing to convert a letter of non-objection to the proposed conversion.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Letter of objection.</E> If the FDIC determines, in its discretion, that the proposed conversion transaction poses a risk to the institution's safety or soundness, violates any law or regulation, or presents a breach of fiduciary duty, then the FDIC shall issue a letter to the institution stating its objection(s) to the proposed conversion and advising the institution not to consummate the proposed conversion until such letter is rescinded. A copy of the letter of objection shall be furnished to the institution's primary state regulator and any other state or federal banking regulator and state or federal securities regulator involved in the conversion.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Consummation of the conversion.</E> (1) An institution may consummate the proposed conversion upon either:</P>
              <P>(i) The receipt of a letter of non-objection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The expiration of the notice period.</P>

This section contains the procedures to be followed to file with the FDIC for a brokered deposit waiver. The FDIC will provide notice to the depository institution's appropriate federal banking agency and any state regulatory agency, as appropriate, that a request for a waiver has been filed and will consult with such agency or agencies, prior to taking action on the institution's request for a waiver.

              <P>Forms and instructions used in connection with applications, reports, and other submittals used by the FDIC can be obtained by contacting the FDIC Public Information Center (550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429; telephone: (877) 275-3342 or (703) 562-2200), except as noted in § 304.3. In addition, many forms and instructions can be obtained from FDIC regional offices. A list of FDIC regional offices can be obtained from the FDIC Public Information Center, or found at the FDIC's website at <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov,</E> or in the directory of FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts published by the FDIC.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, Forms FFIEC 031, 041, and 051.</E> Pursuant to section 7(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(a)) and other applicable law, every insured depository institution is required to file Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (also known as the Call Report) in accordance with the instructions for these reports. All assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, must be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of, the Call Report. The FDIC uses Call Report data from all insured depository institutions to calculate deposit insurance assessments and monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual banks and the banking industry. Reporting banks must also submit annually such information on small business and small farm lending as the FDIC may need to assess the availability of credit to these sectors of the economy. The report forms and instructions can be obtained from the Division of Insurance and Research (DIR), FDIC, 550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429 or through the website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, <E T="03">http://www.ffiec.gov/.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, Form FFIEC 002.</E> Pursuant to section 7(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(a)) and other applicable law, every insured U.S. branch of a foreign bank is required to file a Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks in accordance with the instructions for the report. All assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, must be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of the report. The FDIC uses the reported data to calculate deposit insurance assessments and monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual insured branches and the banking industry. Insured branches must also submit annually such information on small business and small farm lending as the FDIC may need to assess the availability of credit to these sectors of the economy. Because the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System collects and processes this report on behalf of the FDIC, the report forms and instructions can be obtained from Federal Reserve District Banks or through the website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, <E T="03">http://www.ffiec.gov/.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Summary of Deposits, Form FDIC 8020/05.</E> Form 8020/05 is a report on the amount of deposits for each authorized office of an insured depository institution with branches; institutions with only a main office are exempt from reporting. Reports as of June 30 of each year must be submitted no later than the immediately succeeding July 31. The report forms and the instructions for completing the reports will be furnished to all such institutions by, or may be obtained upon request from, the Division of Insurance and Research <PRTPAGE P="52"/>(DIR), FDIC, 550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of Performance of Bank Services, Form FDIC 6120/06.</E> Pursuant to section 7 of the Bank Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1867), as amended, FDIC-supervised institutions must notify the agency about the existence of a service relationship within thirty days after the making of the contract or the performance of the service, whichever occurs first. Form FDIC 6120/06 may be used to satisfy the notice requirement. The form contains identification, location, and contact information for the institution, the servicer, and a description of the services provided. In lieu of the form, notification may be provided by letter. Either the form or the letter containing the notice information must be submitted to the regional director—Division of Risk Management Supervision (RMS) of the region in which the institution's main office is located.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This Part applies to all insured depository institutions, as defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This Part sets forth the rules governing:</P>
            <P>(1) The time and manner for providing certification to the FDIC regarding the assumption of all of the deposit liabilities of an insured depository institution by one or more insured depository institutions; and</P>
            <P>(2) The notification that an insured depository institution shall provide its depositors when a depository institution's insured status is being voluntarily terminated without its deposits being assumed by one or more insured depository institutions.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 307.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Certification of assumption of deposit liabilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">When certification is required.</E> Whenever all of the deposit liabilities of an insured depository institution are assumed by one or more insured depository institutions by merger, consolidation, other statutory assumption, or by contract, the transferring insured depository institution, or its legal successor, shall provide an accurate written certification to the FDIC that its deposit liabilities have been assumed. No certification shall be required when deposit liabilities are assumed by an operating insured depository institution from an insured depository institution in default, as defined in section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(x)(1)), and that has been placed under FDIC receivership.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification requirements.</E> The certification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided on official letterhead of the transferring insured depository institution or its legal successor, signed by a duly authorized official, and state the date the assumption took effect. The certification shall <PRTPAGE P="54"/>indicate the date on which the transferring institution's authority to engage in banking has terminated or will terminate as well as the method of termination (e.g., whether by the surrender of its charter, by the cancellation of its charter or license to conduct a banking business, or otherwise). The certification may follow the form contained in Appendix A of this part. In a merger or consolidation where there is only one surviving entity which is the legal successor to both the transferring and assuming institutions, the surviving entity shall provide any required certification.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing.</E> The certification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided within 30 calendar days after the assumption takes effect, and shall be submitted to the appropriate Regional Director of the FDIC's Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection, as defined in 12 CFR 303.2(g).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Evidence of assumption.</E> The receipt by the FDIC of an accurate certification for a total assumption as required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall constitute satisfactory evidence of such deposit assumption, as required by section 8(q) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(q)), and the insured status of the transferring institution shall terminate on the date of the receipt of the certification. In appropriate circumstances, the FDIC, in its sole discretion, may require additional information, or may consider other evidence of a deposit assumption to constitute satisfactory evidence of such assumption for purposes of section 8(q).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Issuance of an order.</E> The Executive Secretary, upon request from the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection and with the concurrence of the General Counsel, or their respective designees, shall issue an order terminating the insured status of the transferring insured depository institution as of the date of receipt by the FDIC of satisfactory evidence of such assumption, pursuant to section 8(q) of the FDI Act and this regulation. Generally, no order shall be issued, under this paragraph, and insured status shall be cancelled by operation of law:</P>
            <P>(1) If the charter of the transferring institution has been cancelled, revoked, rescinded, or otherwise terminated by operation of applicable state or federal statutes or regulations, or by action of the chartering authority for the transferring institution essentially contemporaneously, that is, generally within five business days after all deposits have been assumed; or</P>
            <P>(2) If the transferring institution is an insured depository institution in default and for which the FDIC has been appointed receiver.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice to depositors when insured status is voluntarily terminated and deposits are not assumed.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice required.</E> An insured depository institution that has obtained authority from the FDIC to terminate its insured status under sections 8(a), 8(p) or 18(i)(3) of the FDI Act without its deposit liabilities being assumed by one or more insured depository institutions shall provide to each of its depositors, at the depositor's last known address of record on the books of the institution, prior written notification of the date the institution's insured status shall terminate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prior approval of notice.</E> The insured depository institution shall provide the appropriate Regional Director of the FDIC's Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection, as defined in 12 CFR 303.2(g), a copy of the proposed notice for approval. After being approved, the notice shall be provided to depositors by the insured depository institution at the time and in the manner specified by the appropriate Regional Director.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> In computing any period of time prescribed by this subpart, the date of the act or event that commences the designated period of time is not included. The last day so computed is included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. When the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are included in the computation of time. However, when the time period within which an act is to be performed is ten days or less, not including any additional time allowed for in paragraph (c) of this section, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are not included.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When.</E> Within 20 days of service of the notice, respondent shall file an answer as designated in the notice. In a civil money penalty proceeding, respondent shall also file a request for a hearing within 20 days of service of the notice.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of answer.</E> An answer must specifically respond to each paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the notice and must admit, deny, or state that the party lacks sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation of fact. A statement of lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each allegation of fact denied; general denials are not permitted. When a respondent denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation of fact in the notice which is not denied in the answer must be deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to respond to the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for relief or proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative defenses, if any, asserted by the respondent.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Default</E>—(1) <E T="03">Effect of failure to answer.</E> Failure of a respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice. If no timely answer is filed, Enforcement Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the administrative law judge shall file with the Board of Directors a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice. Any final order issued by the Board of Directors based upon a respondent's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent.</P>

The respondent must answer an amended notice within the time remaining for the respondent's answer to the original notice, or within ten days after service of the amended notice, whichever period is longer, unless the Board of Directors or administrative law judge orders otherwise for good cause.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendments to conform to the evidence.</E> When issues not raised in the notice or answer are tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties, they will be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the notice or answer, and no formal amendments are required. If evidence is objected to at the hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the notice or answer, the administrative law judge may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action and the objecting party fails to satisfy the administrative law judge <PRTPAGE P="67"/>that the admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The administrative law judge may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Limits on discovery.</E> (1) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, a party to a proceeding under this subpart may obtain document discovery by serving <PRTPAGE P="68"/>a written request to produce documents. For purposes of a request to produce documents, the term “documents” may be defined to include drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, data stored in electronic form, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, or translated, if necessary, by the parties through detection devices into reasonably usable form, as well as written material of all kinds.</P>
              <P>(2) Discovery by use of deposition is governed by subpart I of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Discovery by use of interrogatories is not permitted.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relevance.</E> A party may obtain document discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that has material relevance to the merits of the pending action. Any request to produce documents that calls for irrelevant material, that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or that seeks to obtain privileged documents will be denied or modified. A request is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome if, among other things, it fails to include justifiable limitations on the time period covered and the geographic locations to be searched, the time provided to respond in the request is inadequate, or the request calls for copies of documents to be delivered to the requesting party and fails to include the requestor's written agreement to pay in advance for the copying, in accordance with § 308.25.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Privileged matter.</E> Privileged documents are not discoverable. Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, work-product privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative-process privilege, and any other privileges the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law provide.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time limits.</E> All discovery, including all responses to discovery requests, shall be completed at least 20 days prior to the date scheduled for the commencement of the hearing. No exceptions to this time limit shall be permitted, unless the administrative law judge finds on the record that good cause exists for waiving the requirements of this paragraph.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for document discovery from parties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Any party may serve on any other party a request to produce for inspection any discoverable documents that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served. The request must identify the documents to be produced either by individual item or by category, and must describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. Documents must be produced as they are kept in the usual course of business or must be organized to correspond with the categories in the request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production or copying.</E> The request must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for production and performing any related acts. In lieu of inspecting the documents, the requesting party may specify that all or some of the responsive documents be copied and the copies delivered to the requesting party. If copying of fewer than 250 pages is requested, the party to whom the request is addressed shall bear the cost of copying and shipping charges. If a party requests 250 pages or more of copying, the requesting party shall pay for the copying and shipping charges. Copying charges are the current per page copying rate imposed by 12 CFR part 309 implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). The party to whom the request is addressed may require payment in advance before producing the documents.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Obligation to update responses.</E> A party who has responded to a discovery request with a response that was complete when made is not required to supplement the response to include documents thereafter acquired, unless the responding party learns that:</P>
              <P>(1) The response was materially incorrect when made; or</P>

              <P>(2) The response, though correct when made, is no longer true and a failure to amend the response is, in substance, a knowing concealment.<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Motions to limit discovery.</E> (1) Any party that objects to a discovery request may, within ten days of being served with such request, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 308.23 to strike or otherwise limit the request. If an objection is made to only a portion of an item or category in a request, the portion objected to shall be specified. Any objections not made in accordance with this paragraph and § 308.23 are waived.</P>
              <P>(2) The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion to strike or limit may file a written response within five days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Privilege.</E> At the time other documents are produced, the producing party must reasonably identify all documents withheld on the grounds of privilege and must produce a statement of the basis for the assertion of privilege. When similar documents that are protected by deliberative process, attorney-work-product, or attorney-client privilege are voluminous, these documents may be identified by category instead of by individual document. The administrative law judge retains discretion to determine when the identification by category is insufficient.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Motions to compel production.</E> (1) If a party withholds any documents as privileged or fails to comply fully with a discovery request, the requesting party may, within ten days of the assertion of privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes known to the requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 308.23 for the issuance of a subpoena compelling production.</P>
              <P>(2) The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with the request may file a written response to a motion to compel within five days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Ruling on motions.</E> After the time for filing responses pursuant to this section has expired, the administrative law judge shall rule promptly on all motions filed pursuant to this section. If the administrative law judge determines that a discovery request, or any of its terms, calls for irrelevant material, is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or seeks to obtain privileged documents, he or she may deny or modify the request, and may issue appropriate protective orders, upon such conditions as justice may require. The pendency of a motion to strike or limit discovery or to compel production is not a basis for staying or continuing the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge. Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, the administrative law judge may not release, or order a party to produce, documents withheld on grounds of privilege if the party has stated to the administrative law judge its intention to file a timely motion for interlocutory review of the administrative law judge's order to produce the documents, and until the motion for interlocutory review has been decided.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Enforcing discovery subpoenas.</E> If the administrative law judge issues a subpoena compelling production of documents by a party, the subpoenaing party may, in the event of noncompliance and to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to any appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a subpoena shall not in any manner limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the administrative law judge against a party who fails to produce subpoenaed documents.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (1) Any party may apply to the administrative law judge for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must contain a proposed document subpoena and a brief statement showing the general relevance and reasonableness of the scope of documents sought. The subpoenaing party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for making production in response to the document subpoena.<PRTPAGE P="70"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A party shall only apply for a document subpoena under this section within the time period during which such party could serve a discovery request under § 308.24(d). The party obtaining the document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the subpoenaed person and for serving copies on all parties. Document subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law.</P>
              <P>(3) The administrative law judge shall promptly issue any document subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the administrative law judge determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon such conditions as may be consistent with the Uniform Rules.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Motion to quash or modify.</E> (1) Any person to whom a document subpoena is directed may file a motion to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena. The movant shall serve the motion on all parties, and any party may respond to such motion within ten days of service of the motion.</P>
              <P>(2) Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed on the same basis, including the assertion of privilege, upon which a party could object to a discovery request under § 308.25(d), and during the same time limits during which such an objection could be filed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcing document subpoenas.</E> If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the administrative law judge which directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with so much of the document subpoena as the administrative law judge has not quashed or modified. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a document subpoena shall in no way limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the administrative law judge on a party who induces a failure to comply with subpoenas issued under this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deposition of witness unavailable for hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (1) If a witness will not be available for the hearing, a party desiring to preserve that witness' testimony for the record may apply in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the administrative law judge for the issuance of a subpoena, including a subpoena duces tecum, requiring the attendance of the witness at a deposition. The administrative law judge may issue a deposition subpoena under this section upon showing that:</P>
              <P>(i) The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from attending the hearing because of age, sickness or infirmity, or will otherwise be unavailable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The witness' unavailability was not procured or caused by the subpoenaing party;</P>
              <P>(iii) The testimony is reasonably expected to be material; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) The application must contain a proposed deposition subpoena and a brief statement of the reasons for the issuance of the subpoena. The subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and specify the time and place for taking the deposition. A deposition subpoena may require the witness to be deposed at any place within the country in which that witness resides or has a regular place of employment or such other convenient place as the administrative law judge shall fix.</P>

              <P>(3) Any requested subpoena that sets forth a valid basis for its issuance must be promptly issued, unless the administrative law judge on his or her own motion, requires a written response or requires attendance at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena should be issued.<PRTPAGE P="71"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless the administrative law judge orders otherwise, no deposition under this section shall be taken on fewer than ten days' notice to the witness and all parties. Deposition subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, on any person or company doing business in any state, territory, possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, or as otherwise permitted by law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Objections to deposition subpoenas.</E> (1) The witness and any party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena issued under this section may file a motion with the administrative law judge to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena, but not more than ten days after service of the subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion must be served on all parties.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure upon deposition.</E> (1) Each witness testifying pursuant to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn, and each party shall have the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the ground for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented. All questions, answers, and objections must be recorded.</P>
              <P>(2) Any party may move before the administrative law judge for an order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has refused to submit during the deposition.</P>
              <P>(3) The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking the deposition shall certify that the transcript is a true and complete transcript of the deposition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enforcing subpoenas.</E> If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any order of the administrative law judge which directs compliance with all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under paragraph (b) or (c)(3) of this section, the subpoenaing party or other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the portions of the subpoena that the administrative law judge has ordered enforced. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a deposition subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed by the administrative law judge on a party who fails to comply with, or procures a failure to comply with, a subpoena issued under this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;</P>
              <P>(2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or</P>

Any party may file a response to a request for interlocutory review in <PRTPAGE P="72"/>accordance with § 308.23(d). Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the administrative law judge shall refer the matter to the Board of Directors for final disposition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Suspension of proceeding.</E> Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Board of Directors under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge or the Board of Directors.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The administrative law judge shall recommend that the Board of Directors issue a final order granting a motion for summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in connection with a motion for summary disposition show that:</P>
              <P>(1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and</P>
              <P>(2) The moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Filing of motions and responses.</E> (1) Any party who believes that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that he or she is entitled to a decision as a matter of law may move at any time for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the proceeding. Any party, within 20 days after service of such a motion, or within such time period as allowed by the administrative law judge, may file a response to such motion.</P>
              <P>(2) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, affidavits and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party contends support his or her position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention of the moving party. Any party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he or she contends a genuine dispute exists. Such opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hearing on motion.</E> At the request of any party or on his or her own motion, the administrative law judge may hear oral argument on the motion for summary disposition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Decision on motion.</E> Following receipt of a motion for summary disposition and all responses thereto, the administrative law judge shall determine whether the moving party is entitled to summary disposition. If the administrative law judge determines that summary disposition is warranted, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decision to that effect to the Board of Directors. If the administrative law judge finds that no party is entitled to summary disposition, he or she shall make a ruling denying the motion.</P>

This meeting or telephone <PRTPAGE P="73"/>conference is called a “scheduling conference.” The identification of potential witnesses, the time for and manner of discovery, and the exchange of any prehearing materials including witness lists, statements of issues, stipulations, exhibits and any other materials may also be determined at the scheduling conference.</P>

              <P>(2) Such deposition transcript is admissible to the same extent that testimony would have been admissible had that person testified at the hearing, <PRTPAGE P="76"/>provided that if a witness refused to answer proper questions during the depositions, the administrative law judge may, on that basis, limit the admissibility of the deposition in any manner that justice requires.</P>

              <P>(2) Any such order shall provide that each party shall, upon request, have the same right of oral cross-examination (or redirect examination) as would exist had the witness testified orally rather than through a written statement. Such order shall also provide that any party has a right to call any hostile witness or adverse party to testify orally.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure for imposition of sanctions.</E> (1) The administrative law judge, upon the request of any party, or on his or her own motion, may impose sanctions in accordance with this section, provided that the administrative law judge may only recommend to the Board of Directors the sanction of entering a final order determining the case on the merits.</P>
              <P>(2) No sanction, other than refusing to accept late papers, authorized by this section shall be imposed without prior notice to all parties and an opportunity for any counsel or party against whom sanctions would be imposed to be heard. Such opportunity to be heard may be on such notice, and the response may be in such form, as the administrative law judge directs. The opportunity to be heard may be limited to an opportunity to respond orally immediately after the act or inaction covered by this section is noted by the administrative law judge.</P>
              <P>(3) Requests for the imposition of sanctions by any party, and the imposition of sanctions, shall be treated for interlocutory review purposes in the same manner as any other ruling by the administrative law judge.</P>

              <P>(i) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others;</P>
              <P>(ii) To be seriously lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in material unethical or improper professional conduct;</P>
              <P>(iii) To have engaged in, or aided and abetted, a material and knowing violation of the FDIA; or</P>
              <P>(iv) To have engaged in contemptuous conduct before the FDIC. Suspension or revocation on the grounds set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall only be ordered upon a further finding that the counsel's conduct or character was sufficiently egregious as to justify suspension or revocation.</P>
              <P>(2) Unless otherwise ordered by the Board of Directors, an application for reinstatement by a person suspended or disbarred under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be made in writing at any time more than three years after the effective date of the suspension or disbarment and, thereafter, at any time more than one year after the person's most recent application for reinstatement. The suspension or disbarment shall continue until the applicant has been reinstated by the Board of Directors for good cause shown or until, in the case of a suspension, the suspension period has expired. An applicant for reinstatement under this provision may, in the Board of Directors' sole discretion, be afforded a hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory suspension and disbarment.</E> (1) Any counsel who has been and remains suspended or disbarred by a court of the United States or of any state, territory, district, commonwealth, or possession; or any person who has been and remains suspended or barred from practice before the OCC, Board of Governors, the OTS, the NCUA, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; or any person who has been, within the last ten years, convicted of a felony, or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, shall be suspended automatically from appearing or practicing before the FDIC. A disbarment, suspension, or conviction within the meaning of this paragraph (b) shall be deemed to have occurred when the disbarring, suspending, or convicting agency or tribunal enters its judgment or order, regardless of whether an appeal is pending or could be taken, and includes a judgment or an order on a plea of nolo contendere or on consent, regardless of whether a violation is admitted in the consent.</P>
              <P>(2) Any person appearing or practicing before the FDIC who is the subject of an order, judgment, decree, or finding of the types set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall promptly file with the Executive Secretary a copy thereof, together with any related opinion or statement of the agency or tribunal involved. Any person who fails to so file a copy of the order, judgment, decree, or finding within 30 days after the entry of the order, judgment, decree, or finding or the date such person initiates practice before the FDIC, for that reason alone may be disqualified from practicing before the FDIC until such time as the appropriate filing shall be made. Failure to file any such paper shall not impair the operation of any other provision of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) A suspension or disbarment under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from practice before the FDIC shall continue until the applicant has been reinstated by the Board of Directors for good cause shown, provided that any person suspended or disbarred under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be automatically reinstated by the Executive Secretary, upon appropriate application, if all the grounds for suspension or disbarment under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are subsequently removed by a reversal of the conviction (or the passage of time since the conviction) or termination of the underlying suspension or disbarment. An application for reinstatement on any other grounds by any person suspended or disbarred under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be filed no sooner than one year after the suspension or disbarment, and thereafter, a new request for reinstatement may be made no sooner than one <PRTPAGE P="82"/>year after the counsel's most recent reinstatement application. The application must comply with the requirements of § 303.3 of this chapter. An applicant for reinstatement under this provision may, in the Board of Directors' sole discretion, be afforded a hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hearings under this section.</E> Hearings conducted under this section shall be conducted in substantially the same manner as other hearings under the Uniform Rules, provided that in proceedings to terminate an existing FDIC suspension or disbarment order, the person seeking the termination of the order shall bear the burden of going forward with an application and with the burden of proving the grounds supporting the application, and that the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, direct that any proceeding to terminate an existing suspension or disbarment by the FDIC be limited to written submissions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Summary suspension for contemptuous conduct.</E> A finding by the administrative law judge of contemptuous conduct during the course of any proceeding shall be grounds for summary suspension by the administrative law judge of a counsel or other representative from any further participation in that proceeding for the duration of that proceeding.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Practice defined.</E> Unless the Board of Directors orders otherwise, for the purposes of this section, practicing before the FDIC includes, but is not limited to, transacting any business with the FDIC as counsel or agent for any other person and the preparation of any statement, opinion, or other paper by a counsel, which statement, opinion, or paper is filed with the FDIC in any registration statement, notification, application, report, or other document, with the consent of such counsel.</P>

              <P>(c) Either the financial condition of any acquiring person or the future prospects of the institution might jeopardize the financial stability of the bank or prejudice the interest of the depositors of the bank.</P>
              <P>(d) The competence, experience, or integrity of any acquiring person or of any of the proposed management personnel indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors of the bank, or in the interest of the public, to permit such person to control the bank;</P>

              <P>(e) Any acquiring person neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish to the FDIC all the information required by the FDIC; or<PRTPAGE P="83"/>
              </P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relevant considerations.</E> In determining the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed, the Board of Directors or its designee shall consider the financial resources and good faith of the institution or official, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and any such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority of the Board of Directors.</E> The Board of Directors or its designee may assess civil money penalties under section 8(i) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(i)), and § 308.1(e) of the Uniform Rules (this part).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum civil money penalty amounts.</E> Under the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, the Board of Directors or its designee may assess civil money penalties in the maximum amounts using the following framework:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Statutory formula to calculate inflation adjustments.</E> The FDIC is required by statute to annually adjust for inflation the maximum amount of each civil money penalty within its jurisdiction to administer. The inflation adjustment is calculated by multiplying the maximum dollar amount of the civil money penalty for the previous calendar year by the cost-of-living inflation adjustment multiplier provided annually by the Office of Management and Budget and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of inflation adjustments.</E> By January 15 of each calendar year, the FDIC will publish notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the maximum penalties that may be assessed after each January 15, based on the formula in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for conduct occurring on or after November 2, 2015.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Civil money penalties for violations of 12 U.S.C. 1464(v) and 12 U.S.C. 1817(a)</E>—(1) <E T="03">Late filing—Tier One penalties.</E> Where an institution fails to make or publish its Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) within the appropriate time periods, but where the institution maintains procedures in place reasonably adapted to avoid inadvertent error and the late filing occurred unintentionally and as a result of such error, or where the institution inadvertently transmitted a Call Report that is minimally late, the Board of Directors or its designee may assess a Tier One civil money penalty. The amount of such a penalty shall not exceed the maximum amount calculated and published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Such a penalty may be assessed for each day that the violation continues.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">First offense.</E> Generally, in such cases, the amount assessed shall be an amount calculated and published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice will contain a presumptive penalty amount per day for each of the first 15 days for which the failure continues, and a presumptive amount per day for each subsequent days the failure continues, beginning on the 16th day. The annual <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice will also provide penalty amounts that generally may be assessed for institutions with less than $25,000,000 in assets.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Subsequent offense.</E> The FDIC will calculate and publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a presumptive daily Tier One penalty to be imposed where an institution has been delinquent in making or publishing its Call Report within the preceding five quarters. The published penalty shall identify the amount that will generally be imposed per day for each of the first 15 days for which the failure continues, and the amount that will generally be imposed per day for each subsequent day the failure continues, beginning on the 16th day. The annual <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice will also provide penalty amounts that generally may be assessed for institutions with less than $25,000,000 in assets.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Lengthy or repeated violations.</E> The amounts set forth in this paragraph (e)(1) will be assessed on a case-by-case basis where the amount of time of the institution's delinquency is lengthy or the institution has been delinquent repeatedly in making or publishing its Call Reports.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> Absent extraordinary circumstances outside the control of the institution, penalties assessed for late filing shall not be waived.<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Late-filing—Tier Two penalties.</E> Where an institution fails to make or publish its Call Report within the appropriate time period, the Board of Directors or its designee may assess a Tier Two civil money penalty for each day the failure continues. The amount of such a penalty will not exceed the maximum amount calculated and published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">False or misleading reports or information</E>—(i) <E T="03">Tier One penalties.</E> In cases in which an institution submits or publishes any false or misleading Call Report or information, the Board of Directors or its designee may assess a Tier One civil money penalty for each day the information is not corrected, where the institution maintains procedures in place reasonably adapted to avoid inadvertent error and the violation occurred unintentionally and as a result of such error, or where the institution inadvertently transmits a Call Report or information that is false or misleading. The amount of such a penalty will not exceed the maximum amount calculated and published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tier Two penalties.</E> Where an institution submits or publishes any false or misleading Call Report or other information, the Board of Directors or its designee may assess a Tier Two civil money penalty for each day the information is not corrected. The amount of such a penalty will not exceed the maximum amount calculated and published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tier Three penalties.</E> Where an institution knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any Call Report or information submits or publishes any false or misleading Call Report or other information, the Board of Directors or its designee may assess a Tier Three civil money penalty for each day the information is not corrected. The penalty shall not exceed the lesser of 1 percent of the institution's total assets per day or the amount calculated and published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Mitigating factors.</E> The amounts set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section may be reduced based upon the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">By FDIC.</E> (1) Within 20 days after service of an application, counsel for the FDIC may file with the Executive Secretary and serve on all parties an answer to the application. Unless counsel for the FDIC requests and is granted an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under § 308.179 of this subpart, failure to file an answer within the 20-day period will be treated as a consent to the award requested.</P>
              <P>(2) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the FDIC's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the answer shall include either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 308.180.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reply to answer.</E> The applicant may file a reply with regard to an application filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504 (a)(1), if the FDIC has addressed in its answer any of the following issues: <PRTPAGE P="105"/>that the position of the FDIC was substantially justified, that the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or that special circumstances make an award unjust. The applicant may file a reply with regard to an application filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504 (a)(4), if the FDIC has addressed in its answer any of the following issues: that the applicant has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, that the FDIC's demand is reasonable when compared to the decision of the administrative law judge or that special circumstances make an award unjust. The reply shall be filed within 15 days after service of the answer. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the reply shall include either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 308.180.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">By other parties.</E> Any party to the adversary adjudication, other than the applicant and the FDIC, may file comments on an application within 20 days after service of the application. If the applicant is entitled to file a reply to the FDIC's answer under paragraph (b) of this section, another party may file comments on the answer within 15 days after service of the answer.

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Genera1 rule.</E> To be eligible for an award under this subpart, an applicant must have been named or admitted as a party to the proceeding. In addition, the applicant must show that it meets all other conditions of eligibility set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Types of eligible applicant.</E> The types of eligible applicant are:</P>
              <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, associations, unit of local government or organization, the net worth of which did not exceed $7,000,000 and which did not have more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of an application filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(4), a small entity as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Factors to be considered.</E> In determining the types of eligible applicants:</P>

              <P>(1) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business shall be considered as an <E T="03">individual</E> rather than a <E T="03">sole owner of an unincorporated business</E> if the issues on which he or she prevails are related to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
              <P>(2) An applicant's net worth includes the value of any assets disposed of for the purpose of meeting an eligibility standard and excludes the value of any obligations incurred for this purpose. Transfers of assets or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value will be presumed to have been made for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(3) The net worth of a bank shall be established by the net worth information reported in conformity with applicable instructions and guidelines on the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the last reporting date before the initiation of the adversary adjudication.</P>
              <P>(4) The employees of an applicant include all those persons who were regularly providing services for remuneration for the applicant, under its direction and control, on the date the adversary adjudication was initiated. Part-time employees are included as though they were full-time employees.</P>

              <P>(5) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. The aggregated net worth shall be adjusted if necessary to avoid counting the net worth of any entity twice. As used in this subpart, <E T="03">affiliates</E> are individuals, corporations, and entities that directly or indirectly or acting through one or more entities control a majority of the voting shares of the applicant; and corporations and <PRTPAGE P="106"/>entities of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares. The Board of Directors may, however, on the recommendation of the administrative law judge, or otherwise, determine that such aggregation with regard to one or more of the applicant's affiliates would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of this subpart in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In such a case the net worth and employees of the relevant affiliate or affiliates will not be aggregated with those of the applicant. In addition, the Board of Directors may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(6) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prevailing party.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> An eligible applicant who, following an adversary adjudication has gained victory on the merits in the proceeding is a “prevailing party”. An eligible applicant may be a “prevailing party” if a settlement of the proceeding was effected on terms favorable to it or if the proceeding against it has been dismissed. In appropriate situations an applicant may also have prevailed if the outcome of the proceeding has substantially vindicated the applicant's position on the significant substantive matters at issue, even though the applicant has not totally avoided adverse final action.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Segregation of costs.</E> When a proceeding has presented a number of discrete substantive issues, an applicant may have prevailed even though all the issues were not resolved in its favor. If such an applicant is deemed to have prevailed, any award shall be based on the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the discrete significant substantive issue or issues on which the applicant's position has been upheld. If such segregation of costs is not practicable, the award may be based on a fair proration of those fees and expenses incurred in the entire proceeding which would be recoverable under § 308.175 if proration were not performed, whether separate or prorated treatment is appropriate, and the appropriate proration percentage, shall be determined on the facts of the particular case. Attention shall be given to the significance and nature of the respective issues and their separability and interrelationship.</P>

              <P>(a) For applications filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(1), a prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses unless the position of the FDIC during the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make the award unjust. An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceedings. Awards for fees and expenses incurred before the date on which the adversary adjudication was initiated are allowable if their incurrence was necessary to prepare for the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) For applications filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(4), an applicant may receive an award unless the demand by the FDIC was reasonable when compared with the decision of the administrative law judge, the applicant has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Measure of awards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate, provided that no award under this subpart for the fee of an attorney or agent may exceed $125 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the FDIC pays expert witnesses. An award may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or expert witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or expert <PRTPAGE P="107"/>witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses. Fees and expenses awarded under 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(4) related to defending against an excessive demand shall be paid only as a consequence of appropriations paid in advance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of reasonableness of fees.</E> In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall consider the following:</P>
              <P>(1) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for like services, or, if he or she is an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
              <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
              <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
              <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Awards for studies.</E> The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of an applicant may be awarded to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate payable for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case and not otherwise required by law or sound business or financial practice.</P>

Unaudited financial statements are acceptable unless the administrative law judge or the Board of Directors otherwise requires. Financial statements or reports to a Federal or state agency, prepared before the initiation of the adversary adjudication for other purposes, and accurate as of a date not more than three months prior to the initiation of the proceeding, are acceptable in establishing net worth as of the time of the initiation of the proceeding, unless the administrative law judge or the Board of Directors otherwise requires.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of applicants or affiliates that are not banks, net worth shall be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the excess of total assets over total liabilities, as of the date the underlying proceeding was initiated, except as adjusted under § 308.172(c)(2). Assets and liabilities of individuals shall include those beneficially owned within the meaning of the FDIC's rules and regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) If the applicant or any of its affiliates is a bank, the portion of the statement of net worth which relates to the bank shall consist of a copy of the bank's last Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed before the initiation of the adversary adjudication. In all cases the administrative law judge or the Board of Directors may call for additional information needed to establish the applicant's net worth as of the initiation of the proceeding. Except as adjusted by additional information that was called for under the preceding sentence, net worth shall be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the total equity capital (or, in the case of mutual savings banks, the total surplus accounts) as reported, in conformity with applicable instructions and guidelines, on the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the last reporting date before the initiation of the proceeding.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other plans.</E> If a bank or state savings association is obligated to file, or is currently operating under, a capital restoration plan submitted pursuant to section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o), a cease-and-desist order entered into pursuant to section 8 of the FDI Act, a formal or informal agreement, or a response to a report of examination or report of inspection, it may, with the permission of the FDIC, submit a compliance plan under this section as part of that plan, order, agreement, or response, subject to the deadline provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of plan.</E> The compliance plan shall include a description of the steps the bank or state savings association will take to correct the deficiency and the time within which those steps will be taken.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Extraordinary growth.</E> For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, extraordinary growth means an increase in assets of more than 7.5 percent during any quarter within the 18-month period preceding the issuance of a request for submission of a compliance plan, by a bank or state savings association that is not well capitalized for purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act. For purposes of calculating an increase in assets, assets acquired through merger or acquisition approved pursuant to the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)) will be excluded.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis.</E> This subpart implements the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, Pub. L. 99-509, sections 6101-6104, 100 Stat. 1874 (October 21, 1986), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812, (PFCRA) and made applicable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) by section 23 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (Pub. L. 103-204, 107 Stat. 2369). 31 U.S.C. 3809 of the statute requires each Authority head to promulgate regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the statute.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) Establishes administrative procedures for imposing civil penalties and assessments against persons who make, submit, or present or cause to be made, submitted, or presented false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or written statements to the FDIC or to its agents; and</P>
              <P>(2) Specifies the hearing and appeal rights of persons subject to allegations of liability for such penalties and assessments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subpart applies only to persons who make, submit, or present or cause to be made, submitted, or presented false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or written statements to the FDIC or to its agents acting on behalf of the FDIC in connection with FDIC employment matters, FDIC contracting activities, and the FDIC Asset Purchaser Certification Program. It does not apply to false claims or statements made in connection with programs (other than as set forth in the preceding sentence) related to the FDIC's regulatory, supervision, enforcement, insurance, receivership or liquidation responsibilities. The FDIC is restricting the scope of applicability of this subpart because other civil and administrative remedies are adequate to redress fraud in the areas not covered.</P>

              <P>(a) If the defendant does not file an answer within the time prescribed in § 308.508(a) of this subpart, the reviewing official may refer the complaint to the ALJ.</P>

              <P>(b) Upon the referral of the complaint, the ALJ will promptly serve on defendant in the manner prescribed in <PRTPAGE P="122"/>§ 308.507 of this subpart, a notice that an initial decision will be issued under this section.</P>
              <P>(c) If the defendant fails to answer, the ALJ will assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true, and, if such facts establish liability under § 308.502 of this subpart, the ALJ will issue an initial decision imposing the maximum amount of penalties and assessments allowed under the statute.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, by failing to file a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further review of the penalties and assessments imposed under paragraph (c) of this section, and the initial decision will become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after it is issued.</P>
              <P>(e) If, before such an initial decision becomes final, the defendant files a motion with the ALJ seeking to reopen on the grounds that extraordinary circumstances prevented the defendant from filing an answer, the initial decision will be stayed pending the ALJ's decision on the motion.</P>
              <P>(f) If, in the motion to reopen under paragraph (e) of this section, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will withdraw the initial decision in paragraph (c) of this section, if such a decision has been issued, and will grant the defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.</P>

              <P>(h) The decision denying the motion to reopen under paragraph (e) of this section may be appealed by the defendant to the Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Board within 15 days after the ALJ denies the motion. The timely filing of a notice of appeal will stay the initial decision until the Board decides the issue.</P>
              <P>(i) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the Board, the ALJ will forward the record of the proceeding to the Board.</P>
              <P>(j) The Board will decide whether extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer based solely on the record before the ALJ.</P>
              <P>(k) If the Board decides that extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the Board will remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity to answer.</P>
              <P>(l) If the Board decides that the defendant's failure to file a timely answer is not excused, the Board will reinstate the initial decision of the ALJ, which will become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the Board issues such decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Board, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>

              <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the Board in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statement) charged in the complaint:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
              <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>
              <P>(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
              <P>(5) The value of the government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
              <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the government's loss;</P>
              <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
              <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
              <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
              <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
              <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
              <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
              <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
              <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in a similar transaction;</P>

              <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a state, directly or indirectly; and<PRTPAGE P="129"/>
              </P>
              <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
              <P>(c) Nothing in this section will be construed to limit the ALJ or the Board from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

              <P>(d) Civil money penalties that are assessed under this subpart are subject to annual adjustments to account for inflation as required by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (Pub.

              <P>(e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination will be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ will order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Removal, suspension, or debarment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Good cause for removal, suspension, or debarment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Individuals.</E> The Board of Directors may remove, suspend, or debar an independent public accountant under section 36 of the FDIA from performing audit services for insured depository institutions for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency if, after service of a notice of intention and opportunity for hearing in the matter, the Board of Directors finds that the accountant:</P>
              <P>(i) Lacks the requisite qualifications to perform audit services;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has knowingly or recklessly engaged in conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards, including those standards and conflicts of interest provisions applicable to accountants through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002)) (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and developed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission;</P>
              <P>(iii) Has engaged in negligent conduct in the form of:</P>
              <P>(A) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted; or</P>
              <P>(B) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to perform audit services;</P>
              <P>(iv) Has knowingly or recklessly given false or misleading information, or knowingly or recklessly participated in any way in the giving of false or misleading information, to the FDIC or any officer or employee of the FDIC;</P>
              <P>(v) Has engaged in, or aided and abetted, a material and knowing or reckless violation of any provision of the Federal banking or securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other law;</P>
              <P>(vi) Has been removed, suspended, or debarred from practice before any Federal or state agency regulating the banking, insurance, or securities industries, other than by an action listed in § 308.603, on grounds relevant to the provision of audit services; or</P>
              <P>(vii) Is suspended or debarred for cause from practice as an accountant by any duly constituted licensing authority of any state, possession, commonwealth, or the District of Columbia.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Accounting firms.</E> If the Board of Directors determines that there is good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment of a member or employee of an accounting firm under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Board of Directors also may remove, suspend, or debar such firm or one or more offices of such firm. In considering whether to remove, suspend, or debar an accounting firm or an office thereof, and the term of any sanction against an accounting firm under this section, the Board of Directors may consider, for example:</P>

              <P>(i) The gravity, scope, or repetition of the act or failure to act that constitutes good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment;<PRTPAGE P="134"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The adequacy of, and adherence to, applicable policies, practices, or procedures for the accounting firm's conduct of its business and the performance of audit services;</P>
              <P>(iii) The selection, training, supervision, and conduct of members or employees of the accounting firm involved in the performance of audit services;</P>
              <P>(iv) The extent to which managing partners or senior officers of the accounting firm have participated, directly, or indirectly through oversight or review, in the act or failure to act; and</P>
              <P>(v) The extent to which the accounting firm has, since the occurrence of the act or failure to act, implemented corrective internal controls to prevent its recurrence.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited scope orders.</E> An order of removal, suspension (including an immediate suspension), or debarment may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, be made applicable to a limited number of insured depository institutions for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Remedies not exclusive.</E> The remedies provided in this subpart are in addition to any other remedies the FDIC may have under any other applicable provision of law, rule, or regulation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Proceedings to remove, suspend or debar</E>—(1) <E T="03">Initiation of formal removal, suspension, or debarment proceedings.</E> The Board of Directors may initiate a proceeding to remove, suspend, or debar an accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services by issuing a written notice of intention to take such action that names the individual or firm as a respondent and describes the nature of the conduct that constitutes good cause for such action.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Hearings under paragraph (b) of this section.</E> An accountant or firm named as a respondent in the notice issued under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may request a hearing on the allegations contained in the notice. Hearings conducted under this paragraph shall be conducted in the same manner as other hearings under the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (12 CFR part 308, subpart A) (Uniform Rules).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Immediate suspension from performing audit services</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the Board of Directors serves a written notice of intention to remove, suspend, or debar an accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services, the Board of Directors may, with due regard for the public interest and without a preliminary hearing, immediately suspend such accountant or firm from performing audit services for insured depository institutions for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency if the Board of Directors:</P>
              <P>(i) Has a reasonable basis to believe that the accountant or accounting firm has engaged in conduct (specified in the notice served upon the accountant or accounting firm under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that would constitute grounds for removal, suspension, or debarment under paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Determines that immediate suspension is necessary to avoid immediate harm to an insured depository institution or its depositors or to the depository system as a whole; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Serves such respondent with written notice of the immediate suspension.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> An immediate suspension notice issued under this paragraph will become effective upon service. Such suspension will remain in effect until the date the Board of Directors dismisses the charges contained in the notice of intention, or the effective date of a final order of removal, suspension, or debarment issued by the Board of Directors to the respondent.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Petition to stay.</E> Any accountant or accounting firm immediately suspended from performing audit services in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, within 10 calendar days after service of the notice of immediate suspension, file a petition with the Executive Secretary for a stay of such immediate suspension. If no petition is filed within 10 calendar days, the immediate suspension shall remain in effect.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Hearing on petition.</E> Upon receipt of a stay petition, the Executive Secretary will designate a presiding officer who will fix a place and time (not more than 10 calendar days after receipt of <PRTPAGE P="135"/>the petition, unless extended at the request of petitioner) at which the immediately suspended party may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials and oral argument. Any FDIC employee engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions for the FDIC in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, serve as a presiding officer or participate or advise in the decision of the presiding officer or of the FDIC, except as witness or counsel in the proceeding. In the sole discretion of the presiding officer, upon a specific showing of compelling need, oral testimony of witnesses also may be presented. Enforcement counsel may represent the agency at the hearing. In hearings held pursuant to this paragraph there shall be no discovery, and the provisions of §§ 308.6 through 308.12, § 308.16, and § 308.21 of the Uniform Rules will apply.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Decision on petition.</E> Within 30 calendar days after the hearing, the presiding officer will issue a decision. The presiding officer will grant a stay upon a demonstration that a substantial likelihood exists of the respondent's success on the issues raised by the notice of intention and that, absent such relief, the respondent will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage. In the absence of such a demonstration, the presiding officer will notify the parties that the immediate suspension will be continued pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of intention. The presiding officer will serve a copy of the decision on, and simultaneously certify the record to, the Executive Secretary.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Review of presiding officer's decision.</E> The parties may seek review of the presiding officer's decision by filing a petition for review with the Executive Secretary within 10 calendar days after service of the decision. Replies must be filed within 10 calendar days after the petition filing date. Upon receipt of a petition for review and any reply, the Executive Secretary will promptly certify the entire record to the Board of Directors. Within 60 calendar days of the Executive Secretary's certification, the Board of Directors will issue an order notifying the affected party whether or not the immediate suspension should be continued or reinstated. The order will state the basis of the Board's decision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Publicly available records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Records available on the FDIC's World Wide Web page</E>—(1) <E T="03">Discretionary release of documents.</E> The FDIC encourages the public to explore the wealth of resources available on the FDIC's World Wide Web page, located at: <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov.</E> The FDIC has elected to publish a broad range of materials on its World Wide Web page, including consumer guides; financial and statistical information of interest to the banking industry; and information concerning the FDIC's responsibilities and structure.</P>

            <P>(B) Statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the Board of Directors that are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
            <P>(C) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect the public;</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) That have been requested 3 or more times; and</P>
            <P>(E) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) To the extent permitted by law, the FDIC may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes a final opinion, final order, statement of policy, interpretation or staff manual or instruction. If redaction is necessary, the FDIC will, to the extent technically feasible, indicate the amount of material deleted at the place in the record where such deletion is made unless that indication in and of itself will jeopardize the purpose for the redaction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Public Information Center.</E> The FDIC maintains a Public Information Center or “PIC” that contains Corporate records that the Freedom of Information Act requires be made available for regular inspection and copying, as well as any records or information the FDIC, in its discretion, has regularly made available, to the public. The PIC has extensive materials of interest to the public, including many Reports, Summaries and Manuals used or published by the Corporation that are made available, by appointment, for inspection and copying.

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for requesting records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of a requester who seeks records for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request falls within this category, the FDIC will determine the use to which a requester will put the records requested and seek additional information as it deems necessary.<PRTPAGE P="139"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures the FDIC actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing records in response to a request for records.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a record necessary to respond to a request for <E T="03">records</E> or for inspection of original records that contain exempt material or that cannot otherwise be directly inspected. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audiovisual records, or machine readable records (e.g., magnetic tape or computer disk).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media will be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist will be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by that entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the FDIC may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making this determination.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining records located in response to a request for records to determine whether any portion of any record is permitted to be withheld as exempt information. It includes processing any record for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them or otherwise prepare them for release.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within records. Searches may be done manually and/or by computer using existing programming.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Making a request for records.</E> (1) The request shall be submitted in writing to the Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Group (“FOIA/PA Group”), Legal Division :</P>

            <P>(i) By completing the online request form located on the FDIC's World Wide Web page, found at: <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov;</E>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) By facsimile clearly marked Freedom of Information Act Request to the FOIA/PA Group: (703) 562-2797; or</P>
            <P>(iii) By sending a letter to: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Attn: FOIA/PA Group, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429.</P>
            <P>(2) The request shall contain the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) The name and address of the requester, an electronic mail address, if available, and the telephone number at which the requester may be reached during normal business hours;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether the requester is an educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or news media representative;</P>

            <P>(iii) A statement agreeing to pay the applicable fees, or a statement identifying a maximum fee that is acceptable to the requester, or a request for a <PRTPAGE P="140"/>waiver or reduction of fees that satisfies paragraph (f)(1)(x) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The preferred form and format of any responsive information requested, if other than paper copies.</P>
            <P>(3) A request for identifiable records shall reasonably describe the records in a way that enables the FDIC's staff to identify and produce the records with reasonable effort and without unduly burdening or significantly interfering with any of the FDIC's operations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Defective requests.</E> The FDIC need not accept or process a request that does not reasonably describe the records requested or that does not otherwise comply with the requirements of this part. The FDIC may return a defective request, specifying the deficiency. The requester may submit a corrected request, which will be treated as a new request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Processing requests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Receipt of requests.</E> Upon receipt of a request that satisfies paragraph (b) of this section, the FOIA/PA Group will acknowledge receipt of the request in writing to the requester and provide the requester with an individualized tracking number for the request. The date of receipt for such request, including one that is addressed incorrectly or that is referred by another agency, is the date the FOIA/PA Group actually receives the request.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> (i) The FDIC provides different levels of processing for categories of requests under this part. Requests for records that are readily identifiable by the FOIA/PA Group, and that have already been cleared for public release may qualify for fast-track processing. All other requests shall be handled under normal processing procedures, unless expedited processing has been granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) The FDIC will make the determination whether a request qualifies for fast-track processing. A requester may contact the FOIA/PA Group to learn whether a particular request has been assigned to fast-track processing. If the request has not qualified for fast-track processing, the requester will be given an opportunity to refine the request in order to qualify for fast-track processing. Changes made to requests to obtain faster processing must be in writing.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (i) Where a person requesting expedited access to records has demonstrated a compelling need for the records, or where the FDIC has determined to expedite the response, the FDIC shall process the request as soon as practicable. To show a compelling need for expedited processing, the requester shall provide a statement demonstrating that:</P>
            <P>(A) The failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(B) The requester can establish that they are primarily engaged in information dissemination as their main professional occupation or activity, and there is urgency to inform the public of the government activity involved in the request; and</P>
            <P>(C) The requester's statement must be certified to be true and correct to the best of the person's knowledge and belief and explain in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(ii) The formality of the certification required to obtain expedited treatment may be waived by the FDIC as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>
            <P>(4) A requester seeking expedited processing will be notified whether expedited processing has been granted within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (i) of this section, and the FDIC shall respond to the appeal within ten (10) working days after receipt of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Priority of responses.</E> Consistent with sound administrative process the FDIC processes requests in the order they are received in the separate processing tracks. However, in the agency's discretion, or upon a court order in a matter to which the FDIC is a party, a particular request may be processed out of turn.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Checking status of request.</E> A requester may check on the status of a request using the tracking number assigned to the request to obtain information about the request including the <PRTPAGE P="141"/>date on which the FDIC originally received the request and an estimated date on which the FDIC will complete action on the request. The status of a request may be obtained:</P>
            <P>(i) Online at the FDIC's FOIA Service Center, at <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov,</E> if the request was submitted electronically using the FDIC's online FOIA request form; or</P>
            <P>(ii) By calling the FDIC's FOIA Service Center at (202) 898-7021, if the request was submitted by email, facsimile or regular mail.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Notification.</E> (i) The time for response to requests will be twenty (20) working days except:</P>
            <P>(A) In the case of expedited treatment under paragraph (d)(3) of this section;</P>
            <P>(B) Where the running of such time is suspended for the calculation of a cost estimate for the requester if the FDIC determines that the processing of the request may exceed the requester's maximum fee provision or if the charges are likely to exceed $250 as provided for in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section;</P>
            <P>(C) Where the running of such time is suspended for the payment of fees pursuant to the paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(B) and (f)(1) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(D) In unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and further described in paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) In unusual circumstances as referred to in paragraph (d)(6)(i)(D) of this section, the time limit may be extended for a period of:</P>
            <P>(A) Ten (10) working days as provided by written notice to the requester, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched; or</P>
            <P>(B) Such alternative time period as agreed to by the requester or as reasonably determined by the FDIC when the FDIC notifies the requester that the request cannot be processed in the specified time limit.</P>
            <P>(iii) Unusual circumstances may arise when:</P>
            <P>(A) The records are in facilities, such as field offices or storage centers, that are not located at the FDIC's Washington office;</P>
            <P>(B) The records requested are voluminous or are not in close proximity to one another; or</P>
            <P>(C) There is a need to consult with another agency or among two or more components of the FDIC having a substantial interest in the determination.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Response to request.</E> In response to a request that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, a search shall be conducted of records maintained by the FDIC in existence on the date of receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information located. The FDIC shall notify the requester of:</P>
            <P>(i) The FDIC's determination of the request;</P>
            <P>(ii) The reasons for the determination;</P>
            <P>(iii) The right of the requester to seek assistance from the FDIC's FOIA Public Liaison; and</P>
            <P>(iv) If the response is a denial of an initial request or if any information is withheld, the FDIC will advise the requester in writing:</P>
            <P>(A) If the denial is in part or in whole;</P>
            <P>(B) The name and title of each person responsible for the denial (when other than the person signing the notification);</P>
            <P>(C) The exemptions relied on for the denial;</P>
            <P>(D) The right of the requester to appeal the denial to the FDIC's General Counsel within 90 calendar days following receipt of the notification, as specified in paragraph (i) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(E) The right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the FDIC's FOIA Public Liaison and/or the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Providing responsive records.</E> (1) Copies of requested records shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address indicated in the request, unless the requester elects to take delivery of the documents at the FDIC or makes other acceptable arrangements, or the FDIC deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means.<PRTPAGE P="142"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) The FDIC shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible by the FDIC in that form or format, but the FDIC need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.</P>
            <P>(3) By arrangement with the requester, the FDIC may elect to send the responsive records electronically if a substantial portion of the request is in electronic format. If the information requested is made pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, it will not be sent by electronic means unless reasonable security measures can be provided.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (i) Persons requesting records of the FDIC shall be charged for the direct costs of search, duplication, and review as set forth in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, unless such costs are less than the FDIC's cost of processing the requester's remittance.</P>
            <P>(ii) Requesters will be charged for search and review costs even if responsive records are not located or, if located, are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(iii) Multiple requests seeking similar or related records from the same requester or group of requesters will be aggregated for the purposes of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the FDIC determines that the estimated costs of search, duplication, or review of requested records will exceed the dollar amount specified in the request, or if no dollar amount is specified, the FDIC will advise the requester of the estimated costs (if greater than the FDIC's cost of processing the requester's remittance). The requester must agree in writing to pay the costs of search, duplication, and review prior to the FDIC initiating any records search.</P>
            <P>(v) If the FDIC estimates that its search, duplication, and review costs will exceed $250.00, the requester must pay an amount equal to 20 percent of the estimated costs prior to the FDIC initiating any records search.</P>
            <P>(vi) The FDIC shall ordinarily collect all applicable fees under the final invoice before releasing copies of requested records to the requester.</P>
            <P>(vii) The FDIC may require any requester who has previously failed to pay the charges under this section within 30 calendar days of mailing of the invoice to pay in advance the total estimated costs of search, duplication, and review. The FDIC may also require a requester who has any charges outstanding in excess of 30 calendar days following mailing of the invoice to pay the full amount due, or demonstrate that the fee has been paid in full, prior to the FDIC initiating any additional records search.</P>
            <P>(viii) The FDIC may begin assessing interest charges on unpaid bills on the 31st day following the day on which the invoice was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the invoice.</P>
            <P>(ix) The time limit for the FDIC to respond to a request will not begin to run until the FDIC has received the requester's written agreement under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, and advance payment under paragraph (f)(1) (v) or (vii) of this section, or payment of outstanding charges under paragraph (f)(1)(vii) or (viii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(x) As part of the initial request, a requester may ask that the FDIC waive or reduce fees if disclosure of the records is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Determinations as to a waiver or reduction of fees will be made by the FOIA/PA Group, Legal Division (or designee) and the requester will be notified in writing of his/her determination. A determination not to grant a request for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph may be appealed to the FDIC's General Counsel (or designee) pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Chargeable fees by category of requester.</E> (i) Commercial use requesters shall be charged search, duplication and review costs.</P>

            <P>(ii) Educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions and news media representatives shall be <PRTPAGE P="143"/>charged duplication costs, except for the first 100 pages.</P>
            <P>(iii) Requesters not described in paragraph (f)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be charged the full reasonable direct cost of search and duplication, except for the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages of duplication.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> The dollar amount of fees which the FDIC may charge to records requesters will be established by the Chief Financial Officer of the FDIC (or designee). The FDIC may charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs. Fees are subject to change as costs change.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Manual searches for records.</E> The FDIC will charge for manual searches for records at the basic rate of pay of the employee making the search plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs. Where a single class of personnel (e.g., all clerical, all professional, or all executive) is used exclusively, the FDIC, at its discretion, may establish and charge an average rate for the range of grades typically involved.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Computer searches for records.</E> The fee for searches of computerized records is the actual direct cost of the search, including computer time, computer runs, and the operator's time apportioned to the search. The fee for a computer printout is the actual cost. The fees for computer supplies are the actual costs. The FDIC may, at its discretion, establish and charge a fee for computer searches based upon a reasonable FDIC-wide average rate for central processing unit operating costs and the operator's basic rate of pay plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Duplication of records.</E> (A) The per-page fee for paper copy reproduction of documents is the average FDIC-wide cost based upon the reasonable direct costs of making such copies.</P>
            <P>(B) For other methods of reproduction or duplication, the FDIC will charge the actual direct costs of reproducing or duplicating the documents.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> The FDIC will charge commercial use requesters for the review of records at the time of processing the initial request to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure at the basic rate of pay of the employee making the search plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs. Where a single class of personnel (e.g., all clerical, all professional, or all executive) is used exclusively, the FDIC, at its discretion, may establish and charge an average rate for the range of grades typically involved. The FDIC will not charge at the administrative appeal level for review of an exemption already applied. When records or portions of records are withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply, the FDIC may charge for a subsequent review to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Other services.</E> Complying with requests for special services, other than a readily produced electronic form or format, is at the FDIC's discretion. The FDIC may recover the full costs of providing such services to the requester.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Publication of fee schedule and effective date of changes.</E> (i) The fee schedule is made available on the FDIC's World Wide Web page, found at <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The fee schedule will be set forth in the “Notice of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Records Fees” issued in December of each year or in such “Interim Notice of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Records Fees” as may be issued. Copies of such notices may be obtained at no charge from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FOIA/PA Group, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429, and are available on the FDIC's World Wide Web page as noted in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) The fees implemented in the December or Interim Notice will be effective 30 days after issuance.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Use of contractors.</E> The FDIC may contract with independent contractors to locate, reproduce, and/or disseminate records; provided, however, that the FDIC has determined that the ultimate cost to the requester will be no greater than it would be if the FDIC performed these tasks itself. In no case will the FDIC contract out responsibilities which the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) provides that the FDIC alone may discharge, such as <PRTPAGE P="144"/>determining the applicability of an exemption or whether to waive or reduce fees.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Exempt information.</E> A request for records may be denied if the requested record contains information which falls into one or more of the following categories. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> If the requested record contains both exempt and nonexempt information, the nonexempt portions which may reasonably be segregated from the exempt portions will be released to the requester.

            <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished records on a confidential basis;</P>
            <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>

              <FTREF/> Such request shall specify the information sought with reasonable particularity and shall be accompanied by a statement with supporting documentation showing in detail the relevance of such exempt information to the litigation, justifying good cause for disclosure, and a commitment to be bound by a protective order. Failure to exhaust such administrative request prior to service of a subpoena or other legal process may, in the General Counsel's discretion, serve as a basis for objection to such subpoena or legal process. Customer financial records may not be disclosed to any federal agency that is not a federal financial supervisory agency pursuant to this paragraph unless notice to the customer and certification as required by the RFPA have been given except where disclosure is subject to the relevant exceptions set forth in the RFPA.</P>

            </FTNT>
            <P>(ii) The General Counsel, or designee, may in his or her discretion and for good cause, disclose or authorize disclosure of any exempt record or testimony by a current or former officer, director, employee, agent of the Corporation, or third party, sought in connection with any civil or criminal hearing, proceeding or investigation without the service of a judicial subpoena, or other legal process requiring such disclosure or testimony, if he or she determines that the records or testimony are relevant to the hearing, proceeding or investigation and that disclosure is in the best interests of justice and not otherwise prohibited by Federal statute. Customer financial records shall not be disclosed to any federal agency pursuant to this paragraph that is not a federal financial supervisory agency, unless the records are sought under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. appendix) or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C. appendix) or comparable rules of other courts and in connection with litigation to which the receiving federal agency, employee, officer, director, or agent, and the customer are parties, or disclosure is otherwise subject to the relevant exceptions in the RFPA. Where the General Counsel or designee authorizes a current or former officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation to testify or disclose exempt records pursuant to this paragraph (b)(8), he or she may, in his or her discretion, limit the authorization to so much of the record or testimony as is relevant to the issues at such hearing, proceeding or investigation, and he or she shall give authorization only upon fulfillment of such conditions as he or she deems necessary and practicable to protect the confidential nature of such records or testimony.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Authorization for disclosure by the Chairman of the Corporation's Board of Directors.</E> Except where expressly prohibited by law, the Chairman of the Corporation's Board of Directors may in his or her discretion, authorize the disclosure of any Corporation records. Except where disclosure is required by law, the Chairman may direct any current or former officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation to refuse to disclose any record or to give testimony if the Chairman determines, in his or her discretion, that refusal to permit such disclosure is in the public interest.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Limitations on disclosure.</E> All steps practicable shall be taken to protect the confidentiality of exempt records <PRTPAGE P="150"/>and information. Any disclosure permitted by paragraph (b) of this section is discretionary and nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall be construed as requiring the disclosure of information. Further, nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall be construed as restricting, in any manner, the authority of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Director of the Corporation's Division having primary authority over the exempt records, the Corporation's General Counsel, or their designees, or any other Corporation Division or Office head, in their discretion and in light of the facts and circumstances attendant in any given case, to require conditions upon and to limit the form, manner, and extent of any disclosure permitted by this section. Wherever practicable, disclosure of exempt records shall be made pursuant to a protective order and redacted to exclude all irrelevant or non-responsive exempt information.</P>

This announcement will be made unless a majority of the Board determines by a recorded vote that Corporation business requires that a meeting be called on lesser notice. In such cases, the Corporation will make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, and whether it is open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time, which may be later <PRTPAGE P="158"/>than the commencement of the meeting.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Regular procedure for closing meetings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Unless § 311.6 is applicable, the procedures for closing meetings will be those set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (1) A decision to close a meeting or portion of a meeting will be taken only when a majority of the entire Board votes to take such action. In deciding whether to close a meeting or portion of a meeting, the Board will consider whether the public interest requires an open meeting. A separate vote of the Board will be taken with respect to each meeting which is proposed to be closed in whole or in part to the public. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings which are proposed to be closed in whole or in part to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in the series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in the series. The vote of each Board member will be recorded and no proxies will be allowed.</P>
            <P>(2) Any individual whose interests may be directly affected may request that the Corporation close any portion of a meeting for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (b) (5), (6), or (b)(7) of § 311.3. Requests should be directed to the Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429. After receiving notice that an individual desires a portion of a meeting to be closed, the Board, upon request of any one of its members, will vote by recorded vote whether to close the relevant portion of the meeting. This procedure will apply even if the individual's request is made subsequent to the announcement of a decision to hold an open meeting.</P>
            <P>(3) The Corporation's General Counsel will make the public certification required by § 311.7.</P>
            <P>(4) Within 1 day after any vote taken pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the Corporation will make publicly available a written copy of the vote, reflecting the vote of each Board member. Except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure, if a meeting or portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Corporation will make publicly available within 1 day after the required vote a full written explanation of its action, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</P>
            <P>(5) The Corporation will publicly announce the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, with determinations as to open and closed portions, in the manner and within the time limits prescribed in § 311.4.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Expedited procedure for announcing and closing certain meetings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Since a majority of its meetings may properly be closed pursuant to paragraph (b)(4), (8), (9)(i), or (b)(10) of § 311.3, subsection (d)(4) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b) allows the Corporation to use expedited procedures in closing meetings under these four subparagraphs. Absent a compelling public interest to the contrary, meetings or portions of meetings that can be expected to be closed using these procedures include, but are not limited to: Administrative enforcement proceedings under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818); appointment of the Corporation as conservator of a depository institution, or as receiver, liquidator or liquidating agent of a closed depository institution or a depository institution in danger of closing; and certain management and liquidation activities pursuant to such appointments; possible financial assistance by the Corporation under section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1823); certain depository institution applications including applications to establish or move branches, applications to merge, and applications for insurance; and investigatory activity under section 10(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1820(c)). In announcing and closing meetings or portions of meetings under this section, the following procedures will be observed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Announcement.</E> Except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of § 311.3(b) the Corporation will make public announcement of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting and of each portion thereof at the earliest practicable time. This announcement will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> if publication can be effected at least 1 day prior to the scheduled date of the meeting.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure for closing.</E> (1) The Corporation's General Counsel will make the public certification required by § 311.7.</P>
            <P>(2) At the beginning of a meeting or portion of a meeting to be closed under this section, a recorded vote of the Board will be taken. The Board will determine by its vote whether to proceed with the closing. If a majority of the entire Board votes to close, the meeting will be closed to public observation. Even though a meeting or portion thereof could properly be closed under this section, a majority of the entire Board may find that the public interest requires an open session and vote, reflecting the vote of each Board member, will be made available to the public.</P>

            <P>For every meeting or portion thereof closed under § 311.5 or § 311.6, the Corporation's General Counsel will publicly certify that, in the opinion of such General Counsel, the meeting may be closed to the public and will state each relevant exemptive provision.

              <P>The provisions of this subpart apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States arising from transactions with the FDIC. Administrative offset is authorized under the DCIA.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative offset</E> means withholding funds payable by the United States to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Person</E> includes a natural person or persons, profit or nonprofit corporation, partnership, association, trust, estate, consortium, or other entity which is capable of owing a debt to the United States Government except that agencies of the United States, or any state or local government shall be excluded.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Collection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Director may collect a claim from a person by administrative offset of monies payable by the Government only after:</P>
              <P>(1) Providing the debtor with due process required under this part; and</P>
              <P>(2) Providing the paying agency with written certification that the debtor owes the debt in the amount stated and that the FDIC, as creditor agency, has complied with this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Prior to initiating collection by administrative offset, the Director should determine that the proposed offset is within the scope of this remedy, as set forth in 31 CFR 901.3(a). Administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may not be used to collect debts more than 10 years after the federal government's right to collect the debt first accrued, except as otherwise provided by law. In addition, administrative offset may not <PRTPAGE P="165"/>be used when a statute explicitly prohibits its use to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</P>
              <P>(c) Unless otherwise provided, debts or payments not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under common law, or any other applicable statutory authority.</P>

              <P>(a) Failure to offset a payment would substantially prejudice the FDIC's ability to collect the debt; and</P>
              <P>(b) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of the procedures described in § 313.25. Such prior offsetting shall be followed promptly by the completion of the procedures described in § 313.25.</P>

              <P>(b) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in <E T="03">Cecile Industries, Inc.</E> v. <E T="03">Cheney,</E> 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993), which provides that procedural protections under administrative offset do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act; or</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets, the FDIC first learns of the existence of a debt due when there would be insufficient time to afford the debtor due process under these procedures before the paying agency makes payment to the debtor; in such cases, the Director shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practical and shall refund any money ultimately found not to be due to the U.S. Government.</P>

              <P>(1) Any request by the debtor for such review shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the FDIC within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice of the offset. The Director may waive the time limit for requesting review for good cause shown by the debtor;</P>
              <P>(2) Upon acceptance of a request for review by the debtor, the FDIC shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity, or the Director determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Director shall document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. In cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Director shall make his determination based on a documentary hearing consisting of a review of the written record; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>These salary offset regulations are issued in compliance with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and apply to the collection of debts owed by employees of the FDIC or other federal agencies. These salary offset procedures do not apply where an employee consents to the recovery of a debt from his current pay account. These procedures do not apply to debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code, the tariff laws of the United States or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108). These procedures do not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of an erroneous payment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt, in the manner specified by law or these agency regulations. This section also does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of the collection of a debt under any other applicable statutory authority. When possible, salary offset through centralized administrative offset procedures should be attempted before seeking salary offset from a paying agency different than the creditor agency.</P>

The Notice of Intent to Offset <PRTPAGE P="167"/>shall include the following information and statements:</P>
              <P>(a) That the Director has determined that a debt is owed to the FDIC and intends to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest is paid in full or otherwise resolved;</P>
              <P>(b) The amount of the debt and the factual basis for the debt;</P>
              <P>(c) A salary offset schedule stating the frequency and amount of each deduction, stated as a fixed dollar amount or percentage of disposable pay (not to exceed 15%);</P>
              <P>(d) That in lieu of salary offset, the employee may propose a voluntary repayment plan to satisfy the debt on terms acceptable to the FDIC, which must be documented in writing, signed by the employee and the Director or the Director's designee, and documented in the FDIC's files;</P>

              <P>(f) That the employee has the right to inspect and copy FDIC records not exempt from disclosure relating to the debt claimed, or to receive copies of such records if the employee or the employee's representative is unable personally to inspect the records, due to geographical or other constraints:</P>
              <P>(1) That such requests be made in writing, and identify by name and address the Director or other designated individual to whom the request should be sent; and</P>
              <P>(2) That upon receipt of such a request, the Director or the Director's designee shall notify the employee of the time and location where the records may be inspected and copied;</P>
              <P>(g) That the employee has a right to request a hearing regarding the existence and amount of the debt claimed or the salary offset schedule proposed by the FDIC, provided that the employee files a request for such a hearing with the FDIC in accordance with § 313.42 that such a hearing will be conducted by an impartial official who is an administrative law judge or other hearing official not under the supervision or control of the Board;</P>
              <P>(h) The procedure and deadline for requesting a hearing, including the name, address, and telephone number of the Director or other designated individual to whom a request for hearing must be sent;</P>
              <P>(i) That a request for hearing must be received by the FDIC on or before the 30th calendar day following receipt of the Notice of Intent, and that filing of a request for hearing will stay the collection proceedings;</P>

              <P>(l) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:</P>
              <P>(1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;</P>

              <P>(b) The request must be signed by the employee and must fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her position. The request for hearing must state whether the employee is requesting an oral or documentary hearing. If an oral hearing is requested, the request shall explain why the matter cannot be resolved by a review of documentary evidence alone.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedure for hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Obtaining the services of a hearing official.</E> When the FDIC is the creditor agency and the debtor is an FDIC employee, the FDIC shall designate an administrative law judge or contact any agent of another agency designated in appendix A to 5 CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official. When the FDIC is the creditor agency and the debtor is not an FDIC employee (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the debtor is employed by another federal agency, also known as the paying agency), and the FDIC cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or a hearing official furnished pursuant to a lawful arrangement, the FDIC may contact an agent of the paying agency designated in appendix A to 5 CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official. The paying agency must cooperate with the FDIC to provide a hearing official, as required by the FCCS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice and format of hearing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The hearing official shall determine whether the hearing shall be oral or documentary and shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing, which must be held within 30 calendar days after the request is received, unless the employee requests that the hearing be delayed. If the hearing will be documentary, the employee shall be notified to submit evidence and written arguments in support of his or her case to the hearing official within 30 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> The hearing official may grant a request for an oral hearing if he or she determines that the issues raised by the employee cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., where credibility or veracity are at issue). An oral hearing is not required to be an adversarial adjudication, and the hearing official is not required to apply rules of evidence. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings shall do so under oath or affirmation. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the employee and agency representative are given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument;</P>
              <P>(ii) Informal meetings in which the hearing examiner interviews the employee; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Formal written submissions followed by an opportunity for oral presentation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Documentary hearing.</E> If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she shall decide the issues raised by the employee based upon a review of the written record.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Record.</E> The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing conducted under this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rescheduling of the hearing date.</E> The hearing official shall reschedule a hearing if requested to do so by both parties, who shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of this new hearing.<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> In the absence of good cause, an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the Notice of Intent. If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and issue a decision based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentation submitted by both parties.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Date of decision.</E> The hearing official shall issue a written decision based upon the evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the request for hearing was received by the FDIC, unless the hearing was delayed at the request of the employee. In the event of such a delay, the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. The decision of the hearing official shall be final.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of decision.</E> The written decision shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A summary of the facts concerning the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
              <P>(3) The terms of the repayment schedule, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Official certification of debt.</E> The hearing official's decision shall constitute an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514. Where the FDIC is the creditor agency but not the current paying agency, the FDIC may make a certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt owed to the FDIC, based on the hearing official's certification. The FDIC may make this certification to: the Secretary of the Treasury so that Treasury may offset the employee's current pay account by means of centralized administrative offset (5 CFR 550.1108); or to the current paying agency (5 CFR 550.1109). If the hearing official determines that a debt may not be collected through salary offset but the FDIC as the creditor agency determines that the debt is still valid, the FDIC may seek collection of the debt through other means, including administrative offset of other federal payments or litigation.</P>

              <P>(a) In response to a Notice of Intent, an employee may propose to voluntarily repay the debt through scheduled voluntary payments, in lieu of salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt in this manner shall submit to the Director a written agreement proposing a repayment schedule. This proposal must be received by the Director within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Intent.</P>
              <P>(b) The Director shall notify the employee whether the employee's proposed voluntary repayment agreement is acceptable. It is within the discretion of the Director whether to accept or reject the debtor's proposal, or whether to propose to the debtor a modification of the proposed repayment agreement:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Director decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, he or she shall notify the employee and the employee shall have 30 calendar days from the date he or she received notice of the decision in which to file a request for a hearing on the proposed repayment agreement, as provided in § 313.42; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the Director decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable or the debtor agrees to a modification proposed by the Director, the agreement shall be put in writing and signed by both the employee and the Director.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special review of repayment agreement or salary offset due to changed circumstances.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An employee subject to a voluntary repayment agreement or salary offset payable to the FDIC as creditor agency may request a special review by the Director of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability. A request for special review may be made at any time.</P>
              <P>(b) In support of a request for special review, the employee shall submit to the Director a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:</P>
              <P>(1) Income from all sources;</P>
              <P>(2) Assets;</P>

              <P>(7) Exceptional expenses, if any.</P>
              <P>(c) The employee shall also file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in extreme financial hardship to the employee.</P>
              <P>(d) The Director shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents and determine whether the original salary offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee, for example, by preventing the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses such as food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care. The Director shall notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of his or her determination.</P>
              <P>(e) If the special review results in a revised salary offset or repayment schedule, the Director shall provide a new certification to the paying agency.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsibility of the FDIC as the creditor agency.</E> Upon completion of the procedures established in § 313.40 through § 313.45, the Director shall take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a debt claim to the paying agency, containing the information described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, together with the certification of debt or an installment agreement (or other instruction regarding the payment schedule, if applicable).</P>

              <P>(2) If the collection must be made in installments, inform the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment. The Director may also inform <PRTPAGE P="171"/>the paying agency of the commencement date and number of installments to be paid, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or has signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency, the Director must also advise the paying agency of the actions the FDIC has taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and state the dates such action was taken.</P>
              <P>(4) If the employee is in the process of separating from employment, the Director shall submit the debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection by lump-sum deduction from the employee's final check. The paying agency shall certify the total amount of its collection and furnish a copy of the certification to the FDIC and to the employee.</P>
              <P>(5) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Director may, unless otherwise prohibited, request that money due and payable to the employee from the federal government, including payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801), be administratively offset to collect the debt.</P>
              <P>(6) In the event an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Director shall not repeat the procedures described in § 313.40 through § 313.45 in order to resume collecting the debt. Instead, the FDIC shall review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer and shall ensure that collection is resumed by the new paying agency. The FDIC must submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibility of the FDIC as the paying agency</E>—(1) <E T="03">Complete claim.</E> When the FDIC receives a properly certified claim from a creditor agency, the employee shall be given written notice of the certification, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the periodic deductions. The FDIC shall schedule deductions to begin at the next officially established pay interval or as otherwise provided for in the certification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Incomplete claim.</E> When the FDIC receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the FDIC shall return the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed and that a properly certified debt claim must be received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> The FDIC is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another agency.</E> If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the FDIC, the employee transfers to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the FDIC must certify the total amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification shall be furnished to the employee, and one copy shall be sent to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer. If the FDIC is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the requirements set forth herein and in the OPM's regulation (5 CFR part 550, subpart K) have been fully met.</P>

The subpart provides procedures for the FDIC to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage garnishment. The receipt of payments pursuant to this subpart does not preclude the FDIC from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of federal payments. The FDIC may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage garnishment. This subpart does not apply to the collection of delinquent debts from the wages of federal employees from their federal <PRTPAGE P="173"/>employment. Federal pay is subject to the federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws.</P>

              <P>(a) If the debtor submits a timely written request for a hearing as provided in § 313.82(c), the FDIC will afford the debtor a hearing, which at the FDIC's option may be oral or written. The FDIC will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the Director determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.</P>
              <P>(b) If the FDIC determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by the FDIC. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.</P>
              <P>(c) In cases when it is determined that an oral hearing is not required by this section, the FDIC will accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, the FDIC will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record.</P>

However, the FDIC will not delay issuance of a withholding order unless it determines that the untimely filing of the request was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or the FDIC receives information that the FDIC believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order.</P>

              <P>The FDIC will have the burden of proof to establish the existence or amount of the debt. Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists, or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law. The hearing official shall maintain a record of any hearing held under this section. Hearings are not required to be formal, and evidence may be offered without regard to formal rules of evidence. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings shall do so under oath or affirmation.</P>

              <P>(a) Unless the FDIC receives information that it believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the FDIC will send by first class mail a withholding order to the debtor's employer within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice of the FDIC's intent to seek garnishment) or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a decision to issue a withholding order becomes final.</P>
              <P>(b) The withholding order sent to the employer will be in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, on the FDIC's letterhead, and signed by the head of the agency or delegate. The order will contain all information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order, including the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.</P>

              <P>Along with the withholding order, the FDIC will send to the employer a certification in a form prescribed by <PRTPAGE P="175"/>the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete and return the certification to the FDIC within the time frame prescribed in the instructions to the form.

              <P>(a) Upon receipt of the garnishment order issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay; or</P>
              <P>(2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2). The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by which the debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.</P>
              <P>(c) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority, the following shall apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Unless otherwise provided by federal law, withholding orders issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (b) of this section and shall have priority over other withholding orders which are served later in time. However, withholding orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.</P>
              <P>(3) If a debtor owes more than one debt to the FDIC, the FDIC may issue multiple withholding orders. The total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders will not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.</P>
              <P>(e) The employer shall promptly pay to the FDIC all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this section.</P>
              <P>(f) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.</P>
              <P>(g) Any assignment or allotment by the employee of the employee's earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order under this section, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.</P>
              <P>(h) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from the FDIC to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, reservations of authority, and timing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part 324 establishes minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards for FDIC-supervised institutions. This part 324 includes methodologies for calculating minimum capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of this part 324.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitation of authority.</E> Nothing in this part 324 shall be read to limit the authority of the FDIC to take action under other provisions of law, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or regulation, under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards.</E> Each FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Regulatory capital.</E> Each FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets.</E> (i) Each FDIC-supervised institution must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and subpart F of this part for a market risk FDIC-supervised institution) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution must use the methodologies in subpart E (and subpart F of this part for a market risk FDIC-supervised institution) to calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disclosures.</E> (i) Except for an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that is making public disclosures pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each FDIC-supervised institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each market risk FDIC-supervised institution must make the public disclosures described in subpart F of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reservation of authority.</E> (1) <E T="03">Additional capital in the aggregate.</E> The FDIC may require an FDIC-supervised institution to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if the FDIC determines that the FDIC-supervised institution's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the FDIC-supervised institution's credit, market, operational, or other risks.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Regulatory capital elements.</E> (i) If the FDIC determines that a particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to exclude all or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.<PRTPAGE P="191"/>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Risk-weighted asset amounts.</E> If the FDIC determines that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the FDIC-supervised institution for one or more exposures is not commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Total leverage.</E> If the FDIC determines that the total leverage exposure, or the amount reflected in the FDIC-supervised institution's reported average total consolidated assets, for an on- or off-balance sheet exposure calculated by an FDIC-supervised institution under § 324.10 is inappropriate for the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the FDIC-supervised institution, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Consolidation of certain exposures.</E> The FDIC may determine that the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the FDIC-supervised institution's balance sheet is not commensurate with the risk of the exposure or the relationship of the FDIC-supervised institution to the entity. Upon making this determination, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the FDIC-supervised institution for purposes of determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital ratios accordingly. The FDIC will look to the substance of, and risk associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the FDIC deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A directive is a final order issued to an FDIC-supervised institution that fails to maintain capital at or above the minimum leverage capital requirement as set forth in §§ 324.4 and 324.10. A directive issued pursuant to this section, including a plan submitted under a directive, is enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a final cease-and-desist order issued under section 8(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)).<PRTPAGE P="219"/>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of directives.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution is operating with less than the minimum leverage capital requirement established by this regulation, the FDIC Board of Directors, or its designee(s), may issue and serve upon any FDIC-supervised institution a directive requiring the FDIC-supervised institution to restore its capital to the minimum leverage capital requirement within a specified time period. The directive may require the FDIC-supervised institution to submit to the appropriate FDIC regional director, or other specified official, for review and approval, a plan describing the means and timing by which the FDIC-supervised institution shall achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement. After the FDIC has approved the plan, the FDIC-supervised institution may be required under the terms of the directive to adhere to and monitor compliance with the plan. The directive may be issued during the course of an examination of the FDIC-supervised institution, or at any other time that the FDIC deems appropriate, if the FDIC-supervised institution is found to be operating with less than the minimum leverage capital requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice and opportunity to respond to issuance of a directive.</E> (1) If the FDIC makes an initial determination that a directive should be issued to an FDIC-supervised institution pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the FDIC, through the appropriate designated official(s), shall serve written notification upon the FDIC-supervised institution of its intent to issue a directive. The notice shall include the current leverage capital ratio, the basis upon which said ratio was calculated, the proposed capital injection, the proposed date for achieving the minimum leverage capital requirement and any other relevant information concerning the decision to issue a directive. When deemed appropriate, specific requirements of a proposed plan for meeting the minimum leverage capital requirement may be included in the notice.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 14 days of receipt of notification, the FDIC-supervised institution may file with the appropriate designated FDIC official(s) a written response, explaining why the directive should not be issued, seeking modification of its terms, or other appropriate relief. The FDIC-supervised institution's response shall include any information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other relevant evidence which supports its position, and may include a plan for attaining the minimum leverage capital requirement.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) After considering the FDIC-supervised institution's response, the appropriate designated FDIC official(s) shall serve upon the FDIC-supervised institution a written determination addressing the FDIC-supervised institution's response and setting forth the FDIC's findings and conclusions in support of any decision to issue or not to issue a directive. The directive may be issued as originally proposed or in modified form. The directive may order the FDIC-supervised institution to:</P>
              <P>(A) Achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement established by this regulation by a certain date;</P>
              <P>(B) Submit for approval and adhere to a plan for achieving the minimum leverage capital requirement;</P>
              <P>(C) Take other action as is necessary to achieve the minimum leverage capital requirement; or</P>
              <P>(D) A combination of the above actions.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a directive is to be issued, it may be served upon the FDIC-supervised institution along with the final determination.</P>
              <P>(4) Any FDIC-supervised institution, upon a change in circumstances, may request the FDIC to reconsider the terms of a directive and may propose changes in the plan under which it is operating to meet the minimum leverage capital requirement. The directive and plan continue in effect while such request is pending before the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(5) All papers filed with the FDIC must be postmarked or received by the appropriate designated FDIC official(s) within the prescribed time limit for filing.</P>

              <P>(6) Failure by the FDIC-supervised institution to file a written response to notification of intent to issue a directive within the specified time period shall constitute consent to the issuance of such directive.<PRTPAGE P="220"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enforcement of a directive.</E> (1) Whenever an FDIC-supervised institution fails to follow the directive or to submit or adhere to its capital adequacy plan, the FDIC may seek enforcement of the directive in the appropriate United States district court, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3907(b)(2)(B)(ii), in the same manner and to the same extent as if the directive were a final cease-and-desist order. In addition to enforcement of the directive, the FDIC may seek assessment of civil money penalties for violation of the directive against any FDIC-supervised institution, any officer, director, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the FDIC-supervised institution, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3909(d).</P>
              <P>(2) The directive may be issued separately, in conjunction with, or in addition to, any other enforcement mechanisms available to the FDIC, including cease-and-desist orders, orders of correction, the approval or denial of applications, or any other actions authorized by law. In addition to addressing an FDIC-supervised institution's minimum leverage capital requirement, the capital directive may also address minimum risk-based capital requirements that are to be maintained and calculated in accordance with § 324.10, and, for state savings associations, the minimum tangible capital requirements set for in § 324.10.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For derivative contracts that are not cleared through a QCCP, the cash collateral received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated (by law, regulation or an agreement with the counterparty);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Variation margin is calculated and transferred on a daily basis based on the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The variation margin transferred under the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction is the full amount that is necessary to fully extinguish the net current credit exposure to the counterparty of the derivative contracts, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty under the terms of the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The variation margin is in the form of cash in the same currency as the currency of settlement set forth in the derivative contract, provided that for the purposes of this paragraph, currency of settlement means any currency for settlement specified in the governing qualifying master netting agreement and the credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement, or in the governing rules for a cleared transaction;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The derivative contract and the variation margin are governed by a qualifying master netting agreement between the legal entities that are the counterparties to the derivative contract or by the governing rules for a cleared transaction, and the qualifying master netting agreement or the governing rules for a cleared transaction must explicitly stipulate that the counterparties agree to settle any payment obligations on a net basis, taking into account any variation margin received or provided under the contract if a credit event involving either counterparty occurs;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The variation margin is used to reduce the current credit exposure of the derivative contract, calculated as described in § 324.34(a), and not the PFE; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) For the purpose of the calculation of the NGR described in § 324.34(a)(2)(ii)(B), variation margin described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C)(<E T="03">6</E>) of this section may not reduce the net current credit exposure or the gross current credit exposure;</P>
              <P>(D) The effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the derivative contract) of a credit derivative, or other similar instrument, through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection, provided that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The FDIC-supervised institution may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the amount of any reduction in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative if the reduction is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital;<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The FDIC-supervised institution may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative or other similar instrument, provided that the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection and that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) With respect to a credit derivative that references a single exposure, the reference exposure of the purchased credit derivative is to the same legal entity and ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> with, or is junior to, the reference exposure of the credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) With respect to a credit derivative that references multiple exposures, the reference exposures of the purchased credit derivative are to the same legal entities and rank <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the reference exposures of the credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection, and the level of seniority of the purchased credit derivative ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> to the level of seniority of the credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Where an FDIC-supervised institution has reduced the effective notional amount of a credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must also reduce the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative used to offset the credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection, by the amount of any increase in the mark-to-fair value of the purchased credit derivative that is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Where the FDIC-supervised institution purchases credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on a credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection in net income, but does not record offsetting deterioration in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection in net income (either through reductions in fair value or by additions to reserves), the FDIC-supervised institution may not use the purchased credit protection to offset the effective notional principal amount of the related credit derivative through which the FDIC-supervised institution provides credit protection;</P>

              <P>(E) Where an FDIC-supervised institution acting as a principal has more than one repo-style transaction with the same counterparty and has offset the gross value of receivables due from a counterparty under reverse repurchase transactions by the gross value of payables under repurchase transactions due to the same counterparty, the gross value of receivables associated with the repo-style transactions <E T="03">less</E> any on-balance sheet receivables amount associated with these repo-style transactions included under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, unless the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The offsetting transactions have the same explicit final settlement date under their governing agreements;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The right to offset the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Under the governing agreements, the counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or settle according to a process that is the functional equivalent of net settlement, (that is, the cash flows of the transactions are equivalent, in effect, to a single net amount on the settlement date), where both transactions are settled through the same settlement system, the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of both transactions will occur by the end of the business day, and the settlement of the underlying securities does not interfere with the net cash settlement;</P>

              <P>(F) The counterparty credit risk of a repo-style transaction, including where the FDIC-supervised institution acts as <PRTPAGE P="224"/>an agent for a repo-style transaction and indemnifies the customer with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty in an amount limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the transaction is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) for transactions with a counterparty must be calculated on a transaction by transaction basis, such that each transaction <E T="03">i</E> is treated as its own netting set, in accordance with the following formula, where E<E T="52">i</E> is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the FDIC-supervised institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or provided as collateral to the counterparty, and C<E T="52">i</E> is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the FDIC-supervised institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or received as collateral from the counterparty:

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the transaction is subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) must be calculated as the greater of zero and the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the FDIC-supervised institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase or provided as collateral to a counterparty for all transactions included in the qualifying master netting agreement (ΣE<E T="52">i</E>), <E T="03">less</E> the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the FDIC-supervised institution borrowed, purchased subject to resale or received as collateral from the counterparty for those transactions (ΣC<E T="52">i</E>), in accordance with the following formula:

              <P>(G) If an FDIC-supervised institution acting as an agent for a repo-style transaction provides a guarantee to a customer of the security or cash its customer has lent or borrowed with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty and the guarantee is not limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, the amount of the guarantee that is greater than the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of the collateral the borrower has provided;</P>
              <P>(H) The credit equivalent amount of all off-balance sheet exposures of the FDIC-supervised institution, excluding repo-style transactions, repurchase or reverse repurchase or securities borrowing or lending transactions that qualify for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP, and derivative transactions, determined using the applicable credit conversion factor under § 324.33(b), provided, however, that the minimum credit conversion factor that may be assigned to an off-balance sheet exposure under this paragraph is 10 percent; and</P>
              <P>(I) For an FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution that guarantees the performance of a clearing member client with respect to a cleared transaction must treat its exposure to the clearing member client as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution that guarantees the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client must treat its exposure to the CCP as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution that does not guarantee the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client may exclude its exposure to the CCP for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4)</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member may exclude from its total leverage exposure the effective notional principal amount of credit protection sold through a credit derivative contract, or other similar instrument, that it clears on behalf of a clearing member client through a CCP as calculated in accordance with part (c)(4)(ii)(D); and<PRTPAGE P="225"/>

              <P>(5) <E T="03">State savings association tangible capital ratio.</E> (i) Until January 1, 2014, a state savings association shall determine its tangible capital ratio in accordance with 12 CFR 390.468.</P>
              <P>(ii) As of January 1, 2014, a state savings association's tangible capital ratio is the ratio of the state savings association's core capital (tier 1 capital) to total assets. For purposes of this paragraph, the term total assets shall have the meaning provided in 12 CFR 324.401(g).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Capital adequacy.</E> (1) Notwithstanding the minimum requirements in this part, An FDIC-supervised institution must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which the FDIC-supervised institution is exposed.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Eligible retained income.</E> The eligible retained income of an FDIC-supervised institution is the FDIC-supervised institution's net income, calculated in accordance with the instructions to the Call Report, for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Maximum payout ratio.</E> The maximum payout ratio is the percentage of eligible retained income that an FDIC-supervised institution can pay out in the form of distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter. The maximum payout ratio is based on the FDIC-supervised institution's capital conservation buffer, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, as set forth in Table 1 to § 324.11.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Maximum payout amount.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution's maximum payout amount for the current calendar quarter is equal to the FDIC-supervised institution's eligible retained income, multiplied by the applicable maximum payout ratio, as set forth in Table 1 to § 324.11.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Private sector credit exposure.</E> Private sector credit exposure means an exposure to a company or an individual that is not an exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, the International Monetary Fund, a MDB, a PSE, or a GSE.</P>

              <P>(B) The FDIC-supervised institution's tier 1 capital ratio minus the FDIC-supervised institution's minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 324.10; and</P>
              <P>(C) The FDIC-supervised institution's total capital ratio minus the FDIC-supervised institution's minimum total capital ratio requirement under § 324.10; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A)-(C) of this section, if the FDIC-supervised institution's common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio is less than or equal to the FDIC-supervised institution's minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio requirement under § 324.10, respectively, the FDIC-supervised institution's capital conservation buffer is zero.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Limits on distributions and discretionary bonus payments.</E> (i) An FDIC-supervised institution shall not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments or create an obligation to make such distributions or payments during the current calendar quarter that, in the aggregate, exceed the maximum payout amount.</P>

              <P>(B) Capital conservation buffer was less than 2.5 percent as of the end of the previous calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Prior approval.</E> Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, the FDIC may permit an FDIC-supervised institution to make a distribution or discretionary bonus payment upon a request of the FDIC-supervised institution, if the FDIC determines that the distribution or discretionary bonus payment would not be contrary to the purposes of this section, or to the safety and <PRTPAGE P="227"/>soundness of the FDIC-supervised institution. In making such a determination, the FDIC will consider the nature and extent of the request and the particular circumstances giving rise to the request.</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amount.</E> An advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution or a Category III FDIC-supervised institution has a countercyclical capital buffer amount determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer amounts established for the national jurisdictions where the FDIC-supervised institution's private sector credit exposures are located, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Weighting.</E> The weight assigned to a jurisdiction's countercyclical capital buffer amount is calculated by dividing the total risk-weighted assets for the FDIC-supervised institution's private sector credit exposures located in the jurisdiction by the total risk-weighted assets for all of the FDIC-supervised institution's private sector credit exposures. The methodology an FDIC-supervised institution uses for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of this paragraph (b) must be the methodology that determines its risk-based capital ratios under § 324.10. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the risk-weighted asset amount for a private sector credit exposure that is a covered position under subpart F of this part is its specific risk add-on as determined under § 324.210 multiplied by 12.5.</P>

              <P>(B) If, in accordance with subparts D or E of this part, the FDIC-supervised institution has assigned to a private sector credit exposure a risk weight associated with a protection provider on a guarantee or credit derivative, the location of the exposure is the national jurisdiction where the protection provider is located.<PRTPAGE P="228"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) The location of a securitization exposure is the location of the underlying exposures, or, if the underlying exposures are located in more than one national jurisdiction, the national jurisdiction where the underlying exposures with the largest aggregate unpaid principal balance are located. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the location of an underlying exposure shall be the location of the borrower, determined consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Calculate and deduct from tier 1 capital an amount resulting from insufficient tier 2 capital under § 324.22(f).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Treatment when ceasing to meet the qualifying community banking organization requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section, if an FDIC-supervised institution ceases to meet the definition of a qualifying community banking organization, the FDIC-supervised institution has two reporting periods under its Call Report (grace period) either to satisfy the requirements to be a qualifying community banking organization or to comply with § 324.10(a)(1) and report the required capital measures under § 324.10(a)(1) on its Call Report.</P>

                <P>(D) An FDIC-supervised institution must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than the apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE.</P>

                <P>(2) This section applies to exposures for which:</P>
                <P>(i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the FDIC-supervised institution and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(3) Exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) generally are securitization exposures subject to §§ 324.41 through 324.45.</P>
                <P>(4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in this section, an FDIC-supervised institution may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules of recognition.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:</P>
                <P>(i) The reference exposure ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> with, or is subordinated to, the hedged exposure; and</P>

                <P>(ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to ensure payments under the credit derivative are triggered <PRTPAGE P="260"/>when the obligated party of the hedged exposure fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Substitution approach</E>—(1) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure by substituting the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider under this subpart D for the risk weight assigned to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(i) The FDIC-supervised institution may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the protected exposure under this subpart D, where the applicable risk weight is the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider.</P>
                <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the unprotected exposure under this subpart D, where the applicable risk weight is that of the unprotected portion of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(iii) The treatment provided in this section is applicable when the credit risk of an exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis and may be applicable when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maturity mismatch adjustment.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.</P>
                <P>(2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).</P>
                <P>(3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligated party of the hedged exposure is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the hedged exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the FDIC-supervised institution (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the FDIC-supervised institution (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the FDIC-supervised institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.</P>

                <P>(ii) The collateral haircut approach in paragraph (c) of this section for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized derivative contracts, and single-product netting sets of such transactions.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution may use any approach described in this section that is valid for a particular type of exposure or transaction; however, it must use the same approach for similar exposures or transactions.</P>

                <P>(ii) To qualify for the simple approach, the financial collateral must meet the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(A) The collateral must be subject to a collateral agreement for at least the life of the exposure;</P>
                <P>(B) The collateral must be revalued at least every six months; and</P>
                <P>(C) The collateral (other than gold) and the exposure must be denominated in the same currency.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk weight substitution.</E> (i) An FDIC-supervised institution may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of financial collateral (that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral under this subpart D. For repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions, the collateral is the instruments, gold, and cash the FDIC-supervised institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution must apply a risk weight to the unsecured portion of the exposure based on the risk weight applicable to the exposure under this subpart.</P>

                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution may assign a 10 percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 324.32.</P>
                <P>(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution may assign a zero percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:</P>
                <P>(A) The financial collateral is cash on deposit; or</P>
                <P>(B) The financial collateral is an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 324.32, and the FDIC-supervised institution has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Collateral haircut approach</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or single-product netting set of such transactions, and of any collateral that secures a repo-style transaction that is included in the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part by using the collateral haircut approach in this section. An FDIC-supervised institution may use the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or, with prior written approval of the FDIC, its own estimates of haircuts according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(i)(A) For eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions and netting sets thereof, ∑E equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the FDIC-supervised institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the transaction (or netting set)); and</P>

                <P>(B) For collateralized derivative contracts and netting sets thereof, ∑E equals the exposure amount of the OTC derivative contract (or netting set) calculated under § 324.34 (a)(1) or (2).<PRTPAGE P="263"/>

                <P>(iv) Hs equals the market price volatility haircut appropriate to the instrument or gold referenced in Es;</P>

For a category of securities, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the FDIC-supervised institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the FDIC-supervised institution must at a minimum take into account:</P>

                <P>(iv) Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.</P>
                <P>(v) An FDIC-supervised institution's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. An FDIC-supervised institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. An FDIC-supervised institution that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The exposures are not reported on the FDIC-supervised institution's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</P>
                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</P>
                <P>(4) The securitization does not:</P>
                <P>(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Contain an early amortization provision.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.</E> For synthetic securitizations, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. An FDIC-supervised institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. An FDIC-supervised institution that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The credit risk mitigant is:</P>
                <P>(i) Financial collateral;</P>
                <P>(ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 324.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or</P>
                <P>(iii) A credit derivative that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible credit derivative” in § 324.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 324.2.</P>
                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:</P>
                <P>(i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(ii) Require the FDIC-supervised institution to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>

                <P>(iii) Increase the FDIC-supervised institution's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;<PRTPAGE P="268"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the FDIC-supervised institution in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</P>
                <P>(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the FDIC-supervised institution after the inception of the securitization;</P>
                <P>(3) The FDIC-supervised institution obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</P>
                <P>(4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.</E> (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 324.42(h), if an FDIC-supervised institution is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The FDIC-supervised institution's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:</P>
                <P>(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:</P>
                <P>(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;</P>
                <P>(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average LTV ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);</P>
                <P>(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and</P>
                <P>(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Securitization risk weight approaches.</E> Except as provided elsewhere in this section or in § 324.41:</P>
                <P>(1) An FDIC-supervised institution must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a CEIO that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.</P>

                <P>(2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with §§ 324.43(a) through 324.43(d) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution that is not subject to subpart F of this part may assign a risk weight to the <PRTPAGE P="269"/>securitization exposure using the gross-up approach in accordance with § 324.43(e), provided, however, that such FDIC-supervised institution must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the FDIC-supervised institution cannot, or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must assign a risk weight to the exposure as described in § 324.44.</P>
                <P>(4) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by an FDIC-supervised institution in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), an FDIC-supervised institution may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the FDIC-supervised institution risk weights under §§ 324.41(c), 324.42(a)(1), and 324.43, 324.44, or 324.45, and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exposure amount of a securitization exposure</E>—(1) <E T="03">On-balance sheet securitization exposures.</E> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure (excluding an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security where the FDIC-supervised institution has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 324.22(b)(2), a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction) is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">On-balance sheet securitization exposures held by an FDIC-supervised institution that has made an AOCI opt-out election.</E> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security held by an FDIC-supervised institution that has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 324.22(b)(2) is the FDIC-supervised institution's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Off-balance sheet securitization exposures.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the FDIC-supervised institution could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).</P>
                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does not apply by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent.</P>
                <P>(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100 percent.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and derivative contracts.</E> The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated under § 324.34 or § 324.37, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Overlapping exposures.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying <PRTPAGE P="270"/>exposures of a securitization (such as when an FDIC-supervised institution provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the FDIC-supervised institution may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Implicit support.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the FDIC-supervised institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):</P>
                <P>(1) The FDIC-supervised institution must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must disclose publicly:</P>
                <P>(i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The risk-based capital impact to the FDIC-supervised institution of providing such implicit support.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.</P>
                <P>(2) For an FDIC-supervised institution that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the FDIC-supervised institution may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest-only mortgage-backed securities.</E> Regardless of any other provisions in this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with retained contractual exposure.</E> (1) Regardless of any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.</P>
                <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the FDIC-supervised institution's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.</P>
                <P>(iii) The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.).</P>
                <P>(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized, as defined in subpart H of this part. For purposes of determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the FDIC-supervised institution's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations under this paragraph (h).</P>
                <P>(2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by an FDIC-supervised institution on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for the SSFA.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, an FDIC-supervised institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. An FDIC-supervised institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, an FDIC-supervised institution must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:</P>
                <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using this subpart. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>

                <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this <PRTPAGE P="273"/>section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
                <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
                <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
                <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>
                <P>(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:</P>
                <P>(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or</P>
                <P>(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or</P>
                <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>
                <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in § 324.42(i) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the FDIC-supervised institution to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

                <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in § 324.42(i) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
                <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section and a risk weight of 20 percent.</P>

                <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.</P>

                <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

                <P>(2) To use the gross-up approach, an FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the following four inputs:</P>

                <P>(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;<PRTPAGE P="275"/>

                <P>(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit equivalent amount.</E> The credit equivalent amount of a securitization exposure under this section equals the sum of:</P>

                <P>(ii) The pro rata share multiplied by the enhanced amount, each calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets.</E> To calculate risk-weighted assets for a securitization exposure under the gross-up approach, an FDIC-supervised institution must apply the risk weight required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to the credit equivalent amount calculated in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution must assign a risk weight of not less than 20 percent to a securitization exposure.</P>

                <P>(A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of an FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Available approaches.</E> (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure under § 324.52(b)(3)(i), an FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach described in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alterative modified look-through approach described paragraph (d) of this section, provided, however, that the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to an equity exposure under this section is 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 324.52(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.</P>
                <P>(3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the FDIC-supervised institution does not use the full look-through approach, the FDIC-supervised institution must use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 324.52(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Full look-through approach.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart as if the proportional ownership share of the adjusted carrying value of each exposure were held directly by the FDIC-supervised institution) may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative modified look-through approach.</E> Under the alternative modified look-through approach, an FDIC-supervised institution may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under this subpart based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under this subpart. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under this subpart and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under this subpart until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must use the highest applicable risk weight. An FDIC-supervised institution may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</P>

                <P>Sections 324.61 through 324.63 of this subpart establish public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements described in subpart B of this part for an FDIC-supervised institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as reported on the FDIC-supervised institution's most recent year-end Call Report that is not an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution making public disclosures pursuant to § 324.172. An advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that has not received approval from the FDIC to exit parallel run pursuant to § 324.121(d) is subject to the disclosure requirements described in §§ 324.62 and 324.63. An FDIC-supervised institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as reported on the FDIC-supervised institution's most recent year-end Call Report that is not an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution making public disclosures subject to § 324.172 must comply with § 324.62 unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to the disclosure requirements of § 324.62 or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, total consolidated assets are determined based on the average of the FDIC-supervised institution's total consolidated assets in the four most recent quarters as reported on the Call Report; or the average of the FDIC-supervised institution's total consolidated assets in the most recent consecutive quarters as reported quarterly on the FDIC-supervised institution's Call Report if the FDIC-supervised institution has not filed such a report for each of the most recent four quarters.</P>

                <P>(a) An FDIC-supervised institution described in § 324.61 must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 324.63. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the FDIC-supervised institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the FDIC-supervised institution's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. The FDIC-supervised institution's management may provide all of the disclosures required by §§ 324.61 through 324.63 in one place on the FDIC-supervised institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
                <P>(b) An FDIC-supervised institution described in § 324.61 must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the FDIC-supervised institution must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) If an FDIC-supervised institution described in § 324.61 concludes that specific commercial or financial information that it would otherwise be required to disclose under this section would be exempt from disclosure by the FDIC under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), then the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to disclose that specific information pursuant to this section, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart E establishes:</P>
              <P>(1) Minimum qualifying criteria for FDIC-supervised institutions using institution-specific internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements; and</P>
              <P>(2) Methodologies for such FDIC-supervised institutions to calculate their total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart applies to an FDIC-supervised institution that:</P>
              <P>(i) Is a subsidiary of a global systemically important BHC, as identified pursuant to 12 CFR 217.402;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is a Category II FDIC-supervised institution;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to 12 CFR part 3, subpart E (OCC), 12 CFR part 217, subpart E (Board), or this subpart (FDIC) to calculate its risk-based capital requirements;</P>
              <P>(iv) Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to subpart E of 12 CFR part 217 to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; or</P>
              <P>(v) Elects to use this subpart to calculate its risk-based capital requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) A market risk FDIC-supervised institution must exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted assets under this subpart the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions, over-the-counter derivative positions, cleared transactions, and unsettled transactions).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Principle of conservatism.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The FDIC-supervised institution can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the FDIC that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;</P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC-supervised institution notifies the FDIC in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and</P>
              <P>(4) The exposures to which the FDIC-supervised institution applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the FDIC-supervised institution.</P>

              <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution's empirically based best estimate of the long-run default-weighted average economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the FDIC-supervised institution would expect to incur if the obligor (or a typical obligor in the loss severity grade assigned by the FDIC-supervised institution to the exposure) were to default within a one-year horizon over a mix of economic conditions, including economic downturn conditions; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The FDIC-supervised institution's empirically based best estimate of the economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the FDIC-supervised institution would expect to incur if the obligor (or a typical obligor in the loss severity grade assigned by the FDIC-supervised institution to the exposure) were to default within a one-year horizon during economic downturn conditions.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) An income-producing real estate exposure for which all or substantially all of the repayment of the exposure is reliant on the cash flows of the real estate serving as collateral for the exposure; the FDIC-supervised institution, in economic substance, does not have recourse to the borrower beyond the real estate collateral; and no cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place other than clauses obtained solely out of an abundance of caution; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Other credit exposures to the same legal entity or natural person; and</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A wholesale exposure authorized under section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 364) to a legal entity or natural person who is a debtor-in-possession for purposes of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; and</P>

                <SUBJECT>Qualification requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Process and systems requirements.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.</P>
                <P>(2) The systems and processes used by an FDIC-supervised institution for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart must be consistent with the FDIC-supervised institution's internal risk management processes and management information reporting systems.</P>
                <P>(3) Each FDIC-supervised institution must have an appropriate infrastructure with risk measurement and management processes that meet the qualification requirements of this section and are appropriate given the FDIC-supervised institution's size and level of complexity. Regardless of whether the systems and models that generate the risk parameters necessary for calculating an FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirements are located at any affiliate of the FDIC-supervised institution, the FDIC-supervised institution itself must ensure that the risk parameters and reference data used to determine its risk-based capital requirements are representative of long run experience with respect to its own credit risk and operational risk exposures.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Risk rating and segmentation systems for wholesale and retail exposures.</E> (1)(i) An FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal risk rating and segmentation system that accurately, reliably, and meaningfully differentiates among degrees of credit risk for the FDIC-supervised institution's wholesale and retail exposures. When assigning an internal risk rating, an FDIC-supervised institution may consider a third-party assessment of credit risk, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution's internal risk rating assignment does not rely solely on the external assessment.</P>
                <P>(ii) If an FDIC-supervised institution uses multiple rating or segmentation systems, the FDIC-supervised institution's rationale for assigning an obligor or exposure to a particular system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the obligor or exposure's level of risk. An FDIC-supervised institution must not inappropriately allocate obligors or exposures across systems to minimize regulatory capital requirements.</P>
                <P>(iii) In assigning ratings to wholesale obligors and exposures, including loss severity ratings grades to wholesale exposures, and assigning retail exposures to retail segments, an FDIC-supervised institution must use all relevant and material information and ensure that the information is current.</P>

                <P>(iv) When assigning an obligor to a PD rating or retail exposure to a PD segment, an FDIC-supervised institution must assess the obligor or retail <PRTPAGE P="298"/>borrower's ability and willingness to contractually perform, taking a conservative view of projected information.</P>
                <P>(2) For wholesale exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) An FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each obligor to a single rating grade (reflecting the obligor's likelihood of default). An FDIC-supervised institution may elect, however, not to assign to a rating grade an obligor to whom the FDIC-supervised institution extends credit based solely on the financial strength of a guarantor, provided that all of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposures to the obligor are fully covered by eligible guarantees, the FDIC-supervised institution applies the PD substitution approach in § 324.134(c)(1) to all exposures to that obligor, and the FDIC-supervised institution immediately assigns the obligor to a rating grade if a guarantee can no longer be recognized under this part. The FDIC-supervised institution's wholesale obligor rating system must have at least seven discrete rating grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one rating grade for defaulted obligors.</P>
                <P>(ii) Unless the FDIC-supervised institution has chosen to directly assign LGD estimates to each wholesale exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each wholesale exposure to a loss severity rating grade (reflecting the FDIC-supervised institution's estimate of the LGD of the exposure). An FDIC-supervised institution employing loss severity rating grades must have a sufficiently granular loss severity grading system to avoid grouping together exposures with widely ranging LGDs.</P>
                <P>(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution must have an effective process to obtain and update in a timely manner relevant and material information on obligor and exposure characteristics that affect PD, LGD and EAD.</P>
                <P>(3) For retail exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) An FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal system that groups retail exposures into the appropriate retail exposure subcategory and groups the retail exposures in each retail exposure subcategory into separate segments with homogeneous risk characteristics that provide a meaningful differentiation of risk. The FDIC-supervised institution's system must identify and group in separate segments by subcategories exposures identified in § 324.131(c)(2)(ii) and (iii).</P>
                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal system that captures all relevant exposure risk characteristics, including borrower credit score, product and collateral types, as well as exposure delinquencies, and must consider cross-collateral provisions, where present.</P>
                <P>(iii) The FDIC-supervised institution must review and, if appropriate, update assignments of individual retail exposures to segments and the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk segment. These reviews must occur whenever the FDIC-supervised institution receives new material information, but generally no less frequently than quarterly, and, in all cases, at least annually.</P>
                <P>(4) The FDIC-supervised institution's internal risk rating policy for wholesale exposures must describe the FDIC-supervised institution's rating philosophy (that is, must describe how wholesale obligor rating assignments are affected by the FDIC-supervised institution's choice of the range of economic, business, and industry conditions that are considered in the obligor rating process).</P>
                <P>(5) The FDIC-supervised institution's internal risk rating system for wholesale exposures must provide for the review and update (as appropriate) of each obligor rating and (if applicable) each loss severity rating whenever the FDIC-supervised institution obtains relevant and material information on the obligor or exposure that affects PD, LGD and EAD, but no less frequently than annually.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Quantification of risk parameters for wholesale and retail exposures.</E> (1) The FDIC-supervised institution must have a comprehensive risk parameter quantification process that produces accurate, timely, and reliable estimates of the risk parameters on a consistent basis for the FDIC-supervised institution's wholesale and retail exposures.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution's estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material, and available data that is reflective of the FDIC-supervised institution's actual wholesale and retail exposures and of sufficient quality to support the determination of risk-based capital requirements for the exposures. In particular, the population of exposures in the data used for estimation purposes, the lending standards in use when the data were generated, and other relevant characteristics, should closely match or be comparable to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposures and standards. In addition, an FDIC-supervised institution must:</P>
                <P>(i) Demonstrate that its estimates are representative of long run experience, including periods of economic downturn conditions, whether internal or external data are used;</P>
                <P>(ii) Take into account any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period;</P>
                <P>(iii) Promptly reflect technical advances, new data, and other information as they become available;</P>
                <P>(iv) Demonstrate that the data used to estimate risk parameters support the accuracy and robustness of those estimates; and</P>
                <P>(v) Demonstrate that its estimation technique performs well in out-of-sample tests whenever possible.</P>
                <P>(3) The FDIC-supervised institution's risk parameter quantification process must produce appropriately conservative risk parameter estimates where the FDIC-supervised institution has limited relevant data, and any adjustments that are part of the quantification process must not result in a pattern of bias toward lower risk parameter estimates.</P>
                <P>(4) The FDIC-supervised institution's risk parameter estimation process should not rely on the possibility of U.S. government financial assistance, except for the financial assistance that the U.S. government has a legally binding commitment to provide.</P>
                <P>(5) The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to demonstrate which variables have been found to be statistically significant with regard to EAD. The FDIC-supervised institution's EAD estimates must reflect its specific policies and strategies with regard to account management, including account monitoring and payment processing, and its ability and willingness to prevent further drawdowns in circumstances short of payment default. The FDIC-supervised institution must have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor current outstanding amounts against committed lines, and changes in outstanding amounts per obligor and obligor rating grade and per retail segment. The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to monitor outstanding amounts on a daily basis.</P>
                <P>(6) At a minimum, PD estimates for wholesale obligors and retail segments must be based on at least five years of default data. LGD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of loss severity data, and LGD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of loss severity data. EAD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of exposure amount data, and EAD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of exposure amount data. If the FDIC-supervised institution has relevant and material reference data that span a longer period of time than the minimum time periods specified above, the FDIC-supervised institution must incorporate such data in its estimates, provided that it does not place undue weight on periods of favorable or benign economic conditions relative to periods of economic downturn conditions.</P>
                <P>(7) Default, loss severity, and exposure amount data must include periods of economic downturn conditions, or the FDIC-supervised institution must adjust its estimates of risk parameters to compensate for the lack of data from periods of economic downturn conditions.</P>
                <P>(8) The FDIC-supervised institution's PD, LGD, and EAD estimates must be based on the definition of default in § 324.101.</P>

                <P>(9) If an FDIC-supervised institution uses internal data obtained prior to becoming subject to this subpart E or external data to arrive at PD, LGD, or EAD estimates, the FDIC-supervised <PRTPAGE P="300"/>institution must demonstrate to the FDIC that the FDIC-supervised institution has made appropriate adjustments if necessary to be consistent with the definition of default in § 324.101. Internal data obtained after the FDIC-supervised institution becomes subject to this subpart E must be consistent with the definition of default in § 324.101.</P>
                <P>(10) The FDIC-supervised institution must review and update (as appropriate) its risk parameters and its risk parameter quantification process at least annually.</P>
                <P>(11) The FDIC-supervised institution must, at least annually, conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of reference data to determine relevance of the reference data to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposures, quality of reference data to support PD, LGD, and EAD estimates, and consistency of reference data to the definition of default in § 324.101.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Counterparty credit risk model.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must obtain the prior written approval of the FDIC under § 324.132 to use the internal models methodology for counterparty credit risk and the advanced CVA approach for the CVA capital requirement.</P>

An FDIC-supervised institution proposing to use such an alternative operational risk quantification system must submit a proposal to the FDIC. In determining whether to approve an FDIC-supervised institution's proposal to use an alternative operational risk quantification system, the FDIC will consider the following principles:</P>
                <P>(A) Use of the alternative operational risk quantification system will be allowed only on an exception basis, considering the size, complexity, and risk profile of the FDIC-supervised institution;</P>
                <P>(B) The FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate that its estimate of its operational risk exposure generated under the alternative operational risk quantification system is appropriate and can be supported empirically; and</P>
                <P>(C) An FDIC-supervised institution must not use an allocation of operational risk capital requirements that includes entities other than depository institutions or the benefits of diversification across entities.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Mechanics for calculating total wholesale and retail risk-weighted assets.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its total wholesale and retail risk-weighted asset amount in four distinct phases:</P>
                <P>(1) Phase 1—categorization of exposures;</P>
                <P>(2) Phase 2—assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and segmentation of retail exposures;</P>
                <P>(3) Phase 3—assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures; and</P>
                <P>(4) Phase 4—calculation of risk-weighted asset amounts.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Phase 1—Categorization.</E> The FDIC-supervised institution must determine which of its exposures are wholesale exposures, retail exposures, securitization exposures, or equity exposures. The FDIC-supervised institution must categorize each retail exposure as a residential mortgage exposure, a QRE, or an other retail exposure. The FDIC-supervised institution must identify which wholesale exposures are HVCRE exposures, sovereign exposures, OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, eligible purchased wholesale exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions to which § 324.136 applies, and eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives that are used as credit risk mitigants. The FDIC-supervised institution must identify any on-balance sheet asset that does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, equity, or securitization exposure, as well as any non-material portfolio of exposures described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Phase 2—Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and retail exposures to segments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades.</E> (i) The FDIC-supervised institution must assign each obligor of a wholesale exposure to a single obligor rating grade and must assign each wholesale exposure to which it does not directly assign an LGD estimate to a loss severity rating grade.</P>
                <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution must identify which of its wholesale obligors are in default.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Segmentation of retail exposures.</E> (i) The FDIC-supervised institution must group the retail exposures in each retail subcategory into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics.</P>
                <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution must identify which of its retail exposures are in default. The FDIC-supervised institution must segment defaulted retail exposures separately from non-defaulted retail exposures.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the FDIC-supervised institution determines the EAD for eligible margin loans using the approach in § 324.132(b), the FDIC-supervised institution must identify which of its retail exposures are eligible margin loans for which the FDIC-supervised institution uses this EAD approach and must segment such eligible margin loans separately from other retail exposures.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution may group its eligible purchased wholesale exposures into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics. An FDIC-supervised institution must use the wholesale exposure formula in Table 1 of this section to determine the risk-based capital requirement for each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Phase 3—Assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures.</E> (1) <E T="03">Quantification process.</E> Subject to the limitations in this paragraph (d), the FDIC-supervised institution must:</P>
                <P>(i) Associate a PD with each wholesale obligor rating grade;</P>
                <P>(ii) Associate an LGD with each wholesale loss severity rating grade or assign an LGD to each wholesale exposure;</P>
                <P>(iii) Assign an EAD and M to each wholesale exposure; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Assign a PD, LGD, and EAD to each segment of retail exposures.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Floor on PD assignment.</E> The PD for each wholesale obligor or retail segment may not be less than 0.03 percent, except for exposures to or directly and <PRTPAGE P="305"/>unconditionally guaranteed by a sovereign entity, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, or a multilateral development bank, to which the FDIC-supervised institution assigns a rating grade associated with a PD of less than 0.03 percent.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Floor on LGD estimation.</E> The LGD for each segment of residential mortgage exposures may not be less than 10 percent, except for segments of residential mortgage exposures for which all or substantially all of the principal of each exposure is either:</P>
                <P>(i) Directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a sovereign entity; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Guaranteed by a contingent obligation of the U.S. government or its agencies, the enforceability of which is dependent upon some affirmative action on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee or a third party (for example, meeting servicing requirements).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must assign a PD, LGD, EAD, and M to each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures. If the FDIC-supervised institution can estimate ECL (but not PD or LGD) for a segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the LGD of the segment equals 100 percent and that the PD of the segment equals ECL divided by EAD. The estimated ECL must be calculated for the exposures without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Credit risk mitigation: credit derivatives, guarantees, and collateral.</E> (i) An FDIC-supervised institution may take into account the risk reducing effects of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives in support of a wholesale exposure by applying the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment to the exposure as provided in § 324.134 or, if applicable, applying double default treatment to the exposure as provided in § 324.135. An FDIC-supervised institution may decide separately for each wholesale exposure that qualifies for the double default treatment under § 324.135 whether to apply the double default treatment or to use the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment without recognizing double default effects.</P>
                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution may take into account the risk reducing effects of guarantees and credit derivatives in support of retail exposures in a segment when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In doing so, an FDIC-supervised institution must consider all relevant available information.</P>
                <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of a wholesale exposure when quantifying the LGD of the exposure, and may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of retail exposures when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In order to do so, an FDIC-supervised institution must have established internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty, and risk management processes.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">EAD for OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, and eligible margin loans.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its EAD for an OTC derivative contract as provided in § 324.132 (c) and (d). An FDIC-supervised institution may take into account the risk-reducing effects of financial collateral in support of a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan and of any collateral in support of a repo-style transaction that is included in the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part through an adjustment to EAD as provided in § 324.132(b) and (d). An FDIC-supervised institution that takes collateral into account through such an adjustment to EAD under § 324.132 may not reflect such collateral in LGD.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Effective maturity.</E> An exposure's M must be no greater than five years and no less than one year, except that an exposure's M must be no less than one day if the exposure is a trade related letter of credit, or if the exposure has an original maturity of less than one <PRTPAGE P="306"/>year and is not part of an FDIC-supervised institution's ongoing financing of the obligor. An exposure is not part of an FDIC-supervised institution's ongoing financing of the obligor if the FDIC-supervised institution:</P>
                <P>(i) Has a legal and practical ability not to renew or roll over the exposure in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor;</P>
                <P>(ii) Makes an independent credit decision at the inception of the exposure and at every renewal or roll over; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Has no substantial commercial incentive to continue its credit relationship with the obligor in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">EAD for exposures to certain central counterparties.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution may attribute an EAD of zero to exposures that arise from the settlement of cash transactions (such as equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange, and spot commodities) with a central counterparty where there is no assumption of ongoing counterparty credit risk by the central counterparty after settlement of the trade and associated default fund contributions.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Phase 4—Calculation of risk-weighted assets.</E> (1) <E T="03">Non-defaulted exposures.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(i) An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the dollar risk-based capital requirement for each of its wholesale exposures to a non-defaulted obligor (except for eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives that hedge another wholesale exposure, IMM exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions, and exposures to which the FDIC-supervised institution applies the double default treatment in § 324.135) and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures by inserting the assigned risk parameters for the wholesale obligor and exposure or retail segment into the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 to § 324.131 and multiplying the output of the formula (K) by the EAD of the exposure or segment. Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply a 300 percent risk weight to the EAD of an eligible margin loan if the FDIC-supervised institution is not able to meet the FDIC's requirements for estimation of PD and LGD for the margin loan.</P>

                <P>(ii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a non-defaulted obligor and segment of non-defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and in § 324.135(e) equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.</P>
                <P>(iii) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to non-defaulted obligors and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.</P>

                <P>(A) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.016, and</P>
                <P>(B) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.08.</P>

                <P>(3) <E T="03">Assets not included in a defined exposure category.</E> (i) An FDIC-supervised institution may assign a risk-weighted asset amount of zero to cash owned and held in all offices of the FDIC-supervised institution or in transit and for gold bullion held in the FDIC-supervised institution's own vaults, or held in another depository institution's vaults on an allocated basis, to the extent the gold bullion assets are offset by gold bullion liabilities.</P>

                <P>(iv) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, an FDIC-supervised institution must use a twenty-business-day holding period for the following quarter (except when an FDIC-supervised institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 324.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral, an FDIC-supervised institution must use a twenty-business-day holding period. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the FDIC-supervised institution must set its PFE for that netting set equal to an estimate over a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">EAD for OTC derivative contracts—(1) OTC derivative contracts not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the EAD for an OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. An FDIC-supervised institution may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the FDIC-supervised institution has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the FDIC-supervised institution's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the EAD for multiple OTC derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(6) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. An FDIC-supervised institution may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(6) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the FDIC-supervised institution has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the FDIC-supervised institution's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit derivatives.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section:</P>

                <P>(i) An FDIC-supervised institution that purchases a credit derivative that is recognized under § 324.134 or § 324.135 as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under subpart F of this part is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section so long as the FDIC-supervised institution does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from <PRTPAGE P="315"/>any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.</P>
                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution that is the protection provider in a credit derivative must treat the credit derivative as a wholesale exposure to the reference obligor and is not required to calculate a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the credit derivative under this section, so long as it does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes all or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes (unless the FDIC-supervised institution is treating the credit derivative as a covered position under subpart F of this part, in which case the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Equity derivatives.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under §§ 324.151-324.155 (unless the FDIC-supervised institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part). In addition, if the FDIC-supervised institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part, and under certain other circumstances described in § 324.155, the FDIC-supervised institution must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Single OTC derivative contract.</E> Except as modified by paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the EAD for a single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the FDIC-supervised institution's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the derivative contract.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Current credit exposure.</E> The current credit exposure for a single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract or zero; and</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">PFE.</E> The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 2 to § 324.132. For purposes of calculating either the PFE under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the gross PFE under paragraph (c)(6) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, the notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency. For any OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 2 to § 324.132, the PFE must be calculated using the “other” conversion factors. An FDIC-supervised institution must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, its apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than its apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE. PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.</P>

Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by estimating an unsecured LGD for the contract or netting set and adjusting the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section using the collateral haircut approach in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The FDIC-supervised institution must substitute the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section for ΣE in the equation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and must use a ten-business day minimum holding period (T<E T="52">M</E> = 10) unless a longer holding period is required by paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section.</P>

                <P>(i) The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis);</P>

                <P>(iii) The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate;</P>
                <P>(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the whole life of all contracts in the netting set;</P>
                <P>(v) The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate. The FDIC-supervised institution must estimate expected exposures for OTC derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral agreements;</P>
                <P>(vi) The FDIC-supervised institution must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure. The procedures must include stress testing and scenario analysis;</P>
                <P>(vii) The model must use current market data to compute current exposures. The FDIC-supervised institution must estimate model parameters using historical data from the most recent three-year period and update the data quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. The FDIC-supervised institution should consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where appropriate;</P>

                <P>(viii) When estimating model parameters based on a stress period, the FDIC-supervised institution must use at least three years of historical data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparties. <PRTPAGE P="319"/>The FDIC-supervised institution must review the data set and update the data as necessary, particularly for any material changes in its counterparties. The FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, and maintain documentation of such demonstration, that the stress period coincides with increased CDS or other credit spreads of the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparties. The FDIC-supervised institution must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the FDIC-supervised institution's portfolio. The FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio;</P>
                <P>(ix) An FDIC-supervised institution must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process. The model review should consider whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. As part of the model review process, the FDIC-supervised institution must have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied;</P>
                <P>(x) An FDIC-supervised institution must have policies for the measurement, management and control of collateral and margin amounts; and</P>

                <P>(iii) Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment may use the effective credit duration estimated by the model as M(EPE) in place of the formula in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Effects of collateral agreements on EAD.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution may capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases, but may not capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. Two methods are <PRTPAGE P="320"/>available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement, as set forth in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) With prior written approval from the FDIC, an FDIC-supervised institution may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD. The FDIC-supervised institution may set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required exchange of collateral, plus the period of time required to sell and realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market risk upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of risk is set according to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(ii) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution that can model EPE without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:</P>
                <P>(A) An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The current exposure of the netting set reflecting all collateral held or posted by the FDIC-supervised institution excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. For purposes of this section, the add-on is computed as the expected increase in the netting set's exposure over the margin period of risk (set in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section); or</P>
                <P>(B) Effective EPE without a collateral agreement plus any collateral the FDIC-supervised institution posts to the counterparty that exceeds the required margin amount.</P>
                <P>(iii) For purposes of this part, including paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, the margin period of risk for a netting set subject to a collateral agreement is:</P>
                <P>(A) Five business days for repo-style transactions subject to daily remargining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement, or</P>
                <P>(B) Twenty business days if the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during the previous quarter (except if the FDIC-supervised institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 324.133) or contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or any derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the margin period of risk, then the FDIC-supervised institution must use a margin period of risk for that netting set that is at least two times the minimum margin period of risk for that netting set. If the periodicity of the receipt of collateral is N-days, the minimum margin period of risk is the minimum margin period of risk under this paragraph (d) plus N minus 1. This period should be extended to cover any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk.</P>

                <P>(C) Five business days for an OTC derivative contract or netting set of OTC derivative contracts where the FDIC-supervised institution is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP or where the FDIC-supervised institution provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client. An FDIC-supervised institution must use a longer holding period if the FDIC-supervised institution determines that a longer period is appropriate. Additionally, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to set a longer holding period if the FDIC determines that a longer period is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the transaction or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction.<PRTPAGE P="321"/>

For purposes of this calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level over a one-year horizon.

                <P>(B) Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and</P>

                <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution must assess the potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.</P>
                <P>(iii) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the numerator and denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.</P>
                <P>(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution must review and adjust as appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time.</P>

If a transaction has specific wrong-way risk, the FDIC-supervised institution must treat the transaction as its own netting set and exclude it from the model described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and instead calculate the risk-based capital requirement for the transaction as follows:</P>

                <P>(ii) To calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of the approach in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 324.131, multiply the output <PRTPAGE P="323"/>of the formula by the EAD for the exposure as specified above, and multiply by 12.5.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Guarantees and credit derivatives: PD substitution and LGD adjustment approaches.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) This section applies to wholesale exposures for which:</P>
                <P>(i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the FDIC-supervised institution and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(2) Wholesale exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) are securitization exposures subject to §§ 324.141 through 324.145.</P>
                <P>(3) An FDIC-supervised institution may elect to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covering an exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by using the PD substitution approach or the LGD adjustment approach in paragraph (c) of this section or, if the transaction qualifies, using the double default treatment in § 324.135. An FDIC-supervised institution's PD and LGD for the hedged exposure may not be lower than the PD and LGD floors described in § 324.131(d)(2) and (d)(3).</P>
                <P>(4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged wholesale exposures described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) An FDIC-supervised institution must use the same risk parameters for calculating ECL as it uses for calculating the risk-based capital requirement for the exposure.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules of recognition.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.</P>

                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's <PRTPAGE P="333"/>reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:</P>
                <P>(i) The reference exposure ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> (that is, equally) with or is junior to the hedged exposure; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are exposures to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to assure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligor fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Risk parameters for hedged exposures</E>—(1) <E T="03">PD substitution approach</E>—(i) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure by substituting the PD associated with the rating grade of the protection provider for the PD associated with the rating grade of the obligor in the risk-based capital formula applicable to the guarantee or credit derivative in Table 1 of § 324.131 and using the appropriate LGD as described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. If the FDIC-supervised institution determines that full substitution of the protection provider's PD leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the FDIC-supervised institution may substitute a higher PD than that of the protection provider.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and P of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(A) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure under § 324.131, where PD is the protection provider's PD, LGD is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and EAD is P. If the FDIC-supervised institution determines that full substitution leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the FDIC-supervised institution may use a higher PD than that of the protection provider.</P>
                <P>(B) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 324.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.</P>
                <P>(C) The treatment in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is applicable when the credit risk of a wholesale exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis or when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">LGD of hedged exposures.</E> The LGD of a hedged exposure under the PD substitution approach is equal to:</P>
                <P>(A) The lower of the LGD of the hedged exposure (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative) and the LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative provides the FDIC-supervised institution with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection; or</P>
                <P>(B) The LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative does not provide the FDIC-supervised institution with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">LGD adjustment approach</E>—(i) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure is the greater of:<PRTPAGE P="334"/>
                </P>
                <P>(A) The risk-based capital requirement for the exposure as calculated under § 324.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative; or</P>
                <P>(B) The risk-based capital requirement for a direct exposure to the protection provider as calculated under § 324.131, using the PD for the protection provider, the LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(A) The FDIC-supervised institution's risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure would be the greater of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure as calculated under § 324.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative and EAD set equal to P; or</P>

                <P>(B) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 324.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">M of hedged exposures.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the M of the hedged exposure is the same as the M of the exposure if it were unhedged.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maturity mismatch.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining its risk-based capital requirement for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.</P>
                <P>(2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).</P>
                <P>(3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the FDIC-supervised institution (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the FDIC-supervised institution (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the FDIC-supervised institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.<SU>30</SU>

                <FTNT>
                  <P>
                    <SU>30</SU> For example, where there is a step-up in cost in conjunction with a call feature or where the effective cost of protection increases over time even if credit quality remains the same or improves, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant will be the remaining time to the first call.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>(4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.</P>

                <P>(5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant: P<E T="52">m</E> = E × (t−0.25)/(T−0.25), where:</P>
                <P>(i) P<E T="52">m</E> equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for maturity mismatch;</P>

                <P>(ii) E equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant;<PRTPAGE P="335"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii) t equals the lesser of T or the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant, expressed in years; and</P>
                <P>(iv) T equals the lesser of five or the residual maturity of the hedged exposure, expressed in years.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible credit derivative that does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit derivative: P<E T="52">r</E> = P<E T="52">m</E> × 0.60, where:</P>
                <P>(1) P<E T="52">r</E> equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for lack of restructuring event (and maturity mismatch, if applicable); and</P>
                <P>(2) P<E T="52">m</E> equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant adjusted for maturity mismatch (if applicable).</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Currency mismatch.</E> (1) If an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative: P<E T="52">c</E> = P<E T="52">r</E> × (1−H<E T="52">FX</E>), where:</P>
                <P>(i) P<E T="52">c</E> equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for currency mismatch (and maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable);</P>
                <P>(ii) P<E T="52">r</E> equals effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable); and</P>
                <P>(iii) H<E T="52">FX</E> equals haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the credit risk mitigant and the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must set H<E T="52">FX</E> equal to 8 percent unless it qualifies for the use of and uses its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility based on a ten-business-day holding period and daily marking-to-market and remargining. An FDIC-supervised institution qualifies for the use of its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility if it qualifies for:</P>
                <P>(i) The own-estimates haircuts in § 324.132(b)(2)(iii);</P>
                <P>(ii) The simple VaR methodology in § 324.132(b)(3); or</P>
                <P>(iii) The internal models methodology in § 324.132(d).</P>
                <P>(3) An FDIC-supervised institution must adjust H<E T="52">FX</E> calculated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section upward if the FDIC-supervised institution revalues the guarantee or credit derivative less frequently than once every ten business days using the square root of time formula provided in § 324.132(b)(2)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>).</P>

                <P>(5) The FDIC-supervised institution does not recognize any credit risk mitigation benefits of the guarantee or credit derivative for the hedged exposure other than through application of the double default treatment as provided in this section.</P>
                <P>(6) The FDIC-supervised institution has implemented a process (which has received the prior, written approval of the FDIC) to detect excessive correlation between the creditworthiness of the obligor of the hedged exposure and the protection provider. If excessive correlation is present, the FDIC-supervised institution may not use the double default treatment for the hedged exposure.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (a) is satisfied. An FDIC-supervised institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any securitization exposures it retains in connection with the securitization. An FDIC-supervised institution that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The exposures are not reported on the FDIC-supervised institution's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</P>
                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</P>
                <P>(4) The securitization does not:</P>
                <P>(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Contain an early amortization provision.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.</E> For synthetic securitizations, an FDIC-supervised institution may recognize for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. An FDIC-supervised institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. An FDIC-supervised institution that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must hold risk-based capital under this subpart against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The credit risk mitigant is:</P>
                <P>(i) Financial collateral; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A guarantee that meets all of the requirements of an eligible guarantee in § 324.2 except for paragraph (3) of the definition; or</P>

                </P>
                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:</P>
                <P>(i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(ii) Require the FDIC-supervised institution to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(iii) Increase the FDIC-supervised institution's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the FDIC-supervised institution in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</P>
                <P>(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the FDIC-supervised institution after the inception of the securitization;</P>
                <P>(3) The FDIC-supervised institution obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</P>
                <P>(4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.</E> (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 324.142(k), if an FDIC-supervised institution is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the securitization exposure. The FDIC-supervised institution's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the position in relation to regulatory capital according to this part.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:</P>
                <P>(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure and document such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:</P>
                <P>(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the position, and deal-specific definitions of default;</P>
                <P>(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);</P>
                <P>(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, most recent sales price and historical price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and</P>
                <P>(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under this section for each securitization exposure.</P>

                <P>(1) An FDIC-supervised institution must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and must <PRTPAGE P="340"/>apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of any CEIO that does not constitute after tax gain-on-sale;</P>
                <P>(2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply the supervisory formula approach in § 324.143 to the exposure if the FDIC-supervised institution and the exposure qualify for the supervisory formula approach according to § 324.143(a);</P>
                <P>(3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach, the FDIC-supervised institution may apply the simplified supervisory formula approach under § 324.144;</P>
                <P>(4) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach in § 324.143, and the FDIC-supervised institution does not apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in § 324.144, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure; and</P>
                <P>(5) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by an FDIC-supervised institution in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), an FDIC-supervised institution may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (e) of this section rather than apply the hierarchy of approaches described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures is equal to the sum of its risk-weighted assets calculated using §§ 324.141 through 146.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Deductions.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution may calculate any deduction from common equity tier 1 capital for a securitization exposure net of any DTLs associated with the securitization exposure.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum risk-based capital requirement.</E> Except as provided in § 324.141(c), unless one or more underlying exposures does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, securitization, or equity exposure, the total risk-based capital requirement for all securitization exposures held by a single FDIC-supervised institution associated with a single securitization (excluding any risk-based capital requirements that relate to the FDIC-supervised institution's gain-on-sale or CEIOs associated with the securitization) may not exceed the sum of:</P>
                <P>(1) The FDIC-supervised institution's total risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures calculated under this subpart as if the FDIC-supervised institution directly held the underlying exposures; and</P>
                <P>(2) The total ECL of the underlying exposures calculated under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Exposure amount of a securitization exposure.</E> (1) The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction is the FDIC-supervised institution's carrying value.</P>
                <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative), repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance-sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the FDIC-supervised institution could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).</P>

                <P>(3) The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or OTC derivative contract (other than <PRTPAGE P="341"/>a credit derivative) or cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative) is the &gt;EAD of the exposure as calculated in § 324.132 or § 324.133.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Overlapping exposures.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage of the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when an FDIC-supervised institution provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the FDIC-supervised institution may assign to the overlapping securitization exposure the applicable risk-based capital treatment under this subpart that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Securitizations of non-IRB exposures.</E> Except as provided in § 324.141(c), if an FDIC-supervised institution has a securitization exposure where any underlying exposure is not a wholesale exposure, retail exposure, securitization exposure, or equity exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution:</P>
                <P>(1) Must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of any CEIO that does not constitute gain-on-sale, if the FDIC-supervised institution is an originating FDIC-supervised institution;</P>
                <P>(2) May apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in § 324.144 to the exposure, if the securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (g)(1) of this section;</P>
                <P>(3) Must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure if the securitization exposure does not require deduction or a 1,250 percent risk weight under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, does not qualify for the supervisory formula approach in § 324.143, and the FDIC-supervised institution does not apply the simplified supervisory formula approach in § 324.144 to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Implicit support.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the FDIC-supervised institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):</P>
                <P>(1) The FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must disclose publicly:</P>
                <P>(i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The regulatory capital impact to the FDIC-supervised institution of providing such implicit support.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.</P>
                <P>(2) For an FDIC-supervised institution that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the FDIC-supervised institution may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Interest-only mortgage-backed securities.</E> Regardless of any other provisions in this part, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with recourse.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart E, an FDIC-supervised institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only the contractual amount of retained recourse if all the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(i) The transaction is a sale under GAAP.<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the FDIC-supervised institution's reasonably estimated liability under the recourse arrangement.</P>

                <P>(iii) The loans and leases are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and</P>
                <P>(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution is well-capitalized, as defined in subpart H of this part. For purposes of determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (k), the FDIC-supervised institution's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by an FDIC-supervised institution on transfers of small-business obligations subject to paragraph (k)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.</P>
                <P>(3) If an FDIC-supervised institution ceases to be well capitalized or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the preferential capital treatment specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with recourse that occurred during the time that the FDIC-supervised institution was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.</P>
                <P>(4) The risk-based capital ratios of an FDIC-supervised institution must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.</P>

                  <E T="53">th</E>-<E T="03">to-default credit derivatives</E>— (1) <E T="03">Protection provider.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must determine a risk weight using the supervisory formula approach (SFA) pursuant to § 324.143 or the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) pursuant to § 324.144 for an nth-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (l). In the case of credit protection sold, an FDIC-supervised institution must determine its exposure in the n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of determining the risk weight for an n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative using the SFA or the SSFA, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. For purposes of using the SFA to calculate the risk weight for its exposure in an n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative, parameter A must be set equal to the credit enhancement level (L) input to the SFA formula. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) risk-weighted asset amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure.</P>
                <P>(ii) The detachment point (parameter D) equals the sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure in the n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of the SSFA, parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for the SSFA.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, an FDIC-supervised institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. An FDIC-supervised institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, an FDIC-supervised institution must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:</P>
                <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D of this part. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>
                <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
                <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>

                <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>

                <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in § 324.142(l) for n<E T="53">th</E>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the FDIC-supervised institution to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

                <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in § 324.142(l) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
                <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section, and a risk weight of 20 percent.</P>

                <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent;</P>

                <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
                <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to investment funds, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply either the Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 324.152 or, if it qualifies to do so, the Internal Models Approach (IMA) in § 324.153. An FDIC-supervised institution must use the look-through approaches provided in § 324.154 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 324.2), as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 324.154.</P>

                <P>(A) The policy owner of a separate account an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and cost basis of the separate account when the policy owner of the separate account surrenders the policy, or</P>

                <P>(B) The beneficiary of the contract an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and book value of a specified portfolio of assets.<PRTPAGE P="352"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution that purchases stable value protection on its investment in a separate account must treat the portion of the carrying value of its investment in the separate account attributable to the stable value protection as an exposure to the provider of the protection and the remaining portion of the carrying value of its separate account as an equity exposure to an investment fund.</P>
                <P>(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution that provides stable value protection must treat the exposure as an equity derivative with an adjusted carrying value determined as the sum of § 324.151(b)(1) and (2).</P>

                <P>(3) For unfunded equity commitments that are unconditional, the effective notional principal amount is the notional amount of the commitment.

                <SUBJECT>Simple risk weight approach (SRWA).</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under the SRWA, an FDIC-supervised institution's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the FDIC-supervised institution's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined in this section and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the FDIC-supervised institution's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined in § 324.154.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">SRWA computation for individual equity exposures.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for an individual equity exposure (other than an equity exposure to an investment fund) by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure or the effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge pair (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) by the lowest applicable risk weight in this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Zero percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure to an entity whose credit exposures are exempt from the 0.03 percent PD floor in § 324.131(d)(2) is assigned a zero percent risk weight.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">20 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure to a Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) is assigned a 20 percent risk weight.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">100 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> The following equity exposures are assigned a 100 percent risk weight:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Community development equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Effective portion of hedge pairs.</E> The effective portion of a hedge pair.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-significant equity exposures.</E> Equity exposures, excluding significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated institution in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the FDIC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 324.2 and has greater than immaterial <PRTPAGE P="353"/>leverage, to the extent that the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.</P>
                <P>(A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of an FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If an FDIC-supervised institution does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the FDIC-supervised institution may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</P>
                <P>(B) When determining which of an FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures qualifies for a 100 percent risk weight under this section, an FDIC-supervised institution first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">250 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital pursuant to § 324.22(b)(4) are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">300 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> A publicly traded equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge pair) is assigned a 300 percent risk weight.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">400 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) that is not publicly traded is assigned a 400 percent risk weight.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">600 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure to an investment firm that:</P>
                <P>(i) Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the FDIC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 324.2; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Has greater than immaterial leverage is assigned a 600 percent risk weight.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Hedge transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Hedge pair.</E> A hedge pair is two equity exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective hedge.</E> Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the FDIC-supervised institution acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the FDIC-supervised institution will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. An FDIC-supervised institution must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E:</P>

                <P>(i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is <PRTPAGE P="354"/>positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals zero. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.</P>
                <P>(ii) Under the variability-reduction method of measuring effectiveness:</P>

                  <GID>ER10SE13.045</GID>
                </GPH>
                <P>(iii) Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression coefficient is positive, then the value of E is zero.</P>
                <P>(3) The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.</P>
                <P>(4) The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.</P>

To receive such approval, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate to the FDIC's satisfaction that the FDIC-supervised institution meets the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) The FDIC-supervised institution must have one or more models that:</P>
                <P>(i) Assess the potential decline in value of its modeled equity exposures;</P>
                <P>(ii) Are commensurate with the size, complexity, and composition of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures; and</P>

                <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution's model must produce an estimate of potential losses for its modeled equity exposures that is no less than the estimate of potential losses produced by a VaR methodology employing a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval of the distribution of quarterly returns for a benchmark portfolio of equity exposures comparable to the <PRTPAGE P="355"/>FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures using a long-term sample period.</P>
                <P>(3) The number of risk factors and exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification in the FDIC-supervised institution's model and benchmarking exercise must be sufficient to provide confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the FDIC-supervised institution's estimates.</P>
                <P>(4) The FDIC-supervised institution's model and benchmarking process must incorporate data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures, and must include data from at least one equity market cycle containing adverse market movements relevant to the risk profile of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures. In addition, the FDIC-supervised institution's benchmarking exercise must be based on daily market prices for the benchmark portfolio. If the FDIC-supervised institution's model uses a scenario methodology, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate that the model produces a conservative estimate of potential losses on the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures over a relevant long-term market cycle. If the FDIC-supervised institution employs risk factor models, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate through empirical analysis the appropriateness of the risk factors used.</P>
                <P>(5) The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, that any proxies used in the modeling process are comparable to the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures and that the FDIC-supervised institution has made appropriate adjustments for differences. The FDIC-supervised institution must derive any proxies for its modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio using historical market data that are relevant to the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio (or, where not, must use appropriately adjusted data), and such proxies must be robust estimates of the risk of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative modified look-through approach.</E> Under this approach, an FDIC-supervised institution may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories assigned according to subpart D of this part based on the <PRTPAGE P="357"/>investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest risk weight under subpart D of this part, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest risk weight under subpart D of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must use the highest applicable risk weight. An FDIC-supervised institution may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</P>

                <P>(a) Under the IMA, in addition to holding risk-based capital against an equity derivative contract under this part, an FDIC-supervised institution must hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk in the equity derivative contract by also treating the equity derivative contract as a wholesale exposure and computing a supplemental risk-weighted asset amount for the contract under § 324.132.</P>
                <P>(b) Under the SRWA, an FDIC-supervised institution may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, an FDIC-supervised institution using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.</P>

                <P>§§ 324.171 through 324.173 establish public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements of an FDIC-supervised institution that is an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Disclosure requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An FDIC-supervised institution that is an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the FDIC pursuant to § 324.121(d) must publicly disclose each quarter its total and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and their components as calculated under this subpart (that is, common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, tier 2 capital, total qualifying capital, and total risk-weighted assets).</P>
                <P>(b) An FDIC-supervised institution that is an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the FDIC pursuant to section § 324.121(d) must comply with paragraph (c) of this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction.</P>

                <P>(c)(1) An FDIC-supervised institution described in paragraph (b) of this section must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 324.173. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the FDIC-supervised institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the FDIC-supervised institution's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes to these are disclosed in the interim. Management may provide all <PRTPAGE P="359"/>of the disclosures required by this subpart in one place on the FDIC-supervised institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution described in paragraph (b) of this section must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the FDIC-supervised institution must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(3) If an FDIC-supervised institution described in paragraph (b) of this section believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to disclose those specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) An FDIC-supervised institution that meets any of the criteria in § 324.100(b)(1) before January 1, 2015, must publicly disclose each quarter its supplementary leverage ratio and the components thereof (that is, tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure) as calculated under subpart B of this part, beginning with the first quarter in 2015. This disclosure requirement applies without regard to whether the FDIC-supervised institution has completed the parallel run process and received notification from the FDIC pursuant to § 324.121(d).</P>
                <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution that meets any of the criteria in § 324.100(b)(1) on or after January 1, 2015, or a Category III FDIC-supervised institution must publicly disclose each quarter its supplementary leverage ratio and the components thereof (that is, tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure) as calculated under subpart B of this part beginning with the calendar quarter immediately following the quarter in which the FDIC-supervised institution becomes an advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution or a Category III FDIC-supervised institution. This disclosure requirement applies without regard to whether the FDIC-supervised institution has completed the parallel run process and has received notification from the FDIC pursuant to § 324.121(d).</P>

                <P>(2) An advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution and a Category III FDIC-supervised institution that is required to publicly disclose its supplementary leverage ratio pursuant to § 324.172(d) must make the disclosures required under Table 13 to this section unless the FDIC-supervised institution is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction.</P>

                <P>(3) The disclosures described in Tables 1 through 12 to § 324.173 must be made publicly available for twelve consecutive quarters beginning on January 1, 2014, or a shorter period, as applicable, for the quarters after the FDIC-supervised institution has completed <PRTPAGE P="360"/>the parallel run process and received notification from the FDIC pursuant to § 324.121(d).

              <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, and reservation of authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart F establishes risk-based capital requirements for FDIC-supervised institutions with significant exposure to market risk, provides methods for these FDIC-supervised institutions to calculate their standardized measure for market risk and, if applicable, advanced measure for market risk, and establishes public disclosure requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart F applies to any FDIC-supervised institution with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as reported in the <PRTPAGE P="369"/>FDIC-supervised institution's most recent quarterly Call Report), equal to:</P>
              <P>(i) 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly Call Report; or</P>
              <P>(ii) $1 billion or more.</P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC may apply this subpart to any FDIC-supervised institution if the FDIC deems it necessary or appropriate because of the level of market risk of the FDIC-supervised institution or to ensure safe and sound banking practices.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC may exclude an FDIC-supervised institution that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of this subpart if the FDIC determines that the exclusion is appropriate based on the level of market risk of the FDIC-supervised institution and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of authority</E> (1) The FDIC may require an FDIC-supervised institution to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this subpart if the FDIC determines that the FDIC-supervised institution's capital requirement for market risk as calculated under this subpart is not commensurate with the market risk of the FDIC-supervised institution's covered positions. In making determinations under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the FDIC will apply notice and response procedures generally in the same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in § 324.5(c).</P>
              <P>(2) If the FDIC determines that the risk-based capital requirement calculated under this subpart by the FDIC-supervised institution for one or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or portfolios, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or portfolios.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC may also require an FDIC-supervised institution to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under this subpart, or under subpart D or subpart E of this part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the positions.</P>
              <P>(4) Nothing in this subpart limits the authority of the FDIC under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Trading positions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Identification of trading positions.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining which of its trading assets and trading liabilities are trading positions and which of its trading positions are correlation trading positions. These policies and procedures must take into account:</P>
              <P>(i) The extent to which a position, or a hedge of its material risks, can be marked-to-market daily by reference to a two-way market; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Possible impairments to the liquidity of a position or its hedge.</P>

              <P>(ii) The hedging strategy must articulate for each portfolio of trading positions the level of market risk the FDIC-supervised institution is willing to accept and must detail the instruments, techniques, and strategies the FDIC-supervised institution will use to hedge the risk of the portfolio.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Management of covered positions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Active management.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must have clearly defined policies and procedures for actively managing all covered positions. At a minimum, these policies and procedures must require:</P>

The valuation process must consider, as appropriate, unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, early termination costs, investing and funding costs, liquidity, and model risk.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for internal models.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution must obtain the prior written approval of the FDIC before using any internal model to calculate its risk-based capital requirement under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) An FDIC-supervised institution must meet all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis. The FDIC-supervised institution must promptly notify the FDIC when:</P>

              <P>(4) The FDIC-supervised institution must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its internal models in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance those models as appropriate to ensure that they continue to meet the FDIC's standards for model approval and employ risk measurement methodologies that are most appropriate for the FDIC-supervised institution's covered positions.</P>
              <P>(5) The FDIC-supervised institution must incorporate its internal models into its risk management process and integrate the internal models used for calculating its VaR-based measure into its daily risk management process.</P>

              <P>(9) The FDIC-supervised institution must have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal models to ensure continued applicability and relevance.</P>
              <P>(10) If an FDIC-supervised institution uses internal models to measure specific risk, the internal models must also satisfy the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of § 324.207.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (1) The FDIC-supervised institution must have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.</P>

              <P>(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must validate its internal models initially and on an ongoing basis. The FDIC-supervised institution's validation process must be independent of <PRTPAGE P="374"/>the internal models' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:</P>
              <P>(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the internal models;</P>
              <P>(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and the comparison of the FDIC-supervised institution's model outputs with relevant internal and external data sources or estimation techniques; and</P>
              <P>(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting. For internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure, this process must include a comparison of the changes in the FDIC-supervised institution's portfolio value that would have occurred were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with VaR-based measures during a sample period not used in model development.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC-supervised institution must stress test the market risk of its covered positions at a frequency appropriate to each portfolio, and in no case less frequently than quarterly. The stress tests must take into account concentration risk (including but not limited to concentrations in single issuers, industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity under stressed market conditions, and risks arising from the FDIC-supervised institution's trading activities that may not be adequately captured in its internal models.</P>
              <P>(4) The FDIC-supervised institution must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the FDIC-supervised institution's market risk measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and independent risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the FDIC-supervised institution's measures for market risk under this subpart. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the FDIC-supervised institution's board of directors (or a committee thereof).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Internal assessment of capital adequacy.</E> The FDIC-supervised institution must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its market risk. The assessment must take into account risks that may not be captured fully in the VaR-based measure, including concentration and liquidity risk under stressed market conditions.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The FDIC-supervised institution must adequately document all material aspects of its internal models, management and valuation of covered positions, control, oversight, validation and review processes and results, and internal assessment of capital adequacy.</P>

              <SUBJECT>VaR-based measure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must use one or more internal models to calculate daily a VaR-based measure of the general market risk of all covered positions. The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the FDIC-supervised institution's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of § 324.207(b)(1). The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the FDIC-supervised institution's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under § 324.209. An FDIC-supervised institution may elect to include term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.</P>
              <P>(1) The FDIC-supervised institution's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve—in no case less than six—to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
              <P>(2) The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the FDIC-supervised institution validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the FDIC-supervised institution must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.</P>
              <P>(3) The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the fair value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors. An FDIC-supervised institution with a large or complex options portfolio must measure the volatility of options positions or positions with embedded optionality by different maturities and/or strike prices, where material.</P>
              <P>(4) The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to justify to the satisfaction of the FDIC the omission of any risk factors from the calculation of its VaR-based measure that the FDIC-supervised institution uses in its pricing models.</P>
              <P>(5) The FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDIC the appropriateness of any proxies used to capture the risks of the FDIC-supervised institution's actual positions for which such proxies are used.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for VaR-based measure.</E> (1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the FDIC-supervised institution may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. An FDIC-supervised institution that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the FDIC.<PRTPAGE P="377"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the FDIC-supervised institution's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The FDIC-supervised institution must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For an FDIC-supervised institution that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the FDIC-supervised institution must either:</P>
              <P>(i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrate to the FDIC that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the FDIC-supervised institution's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. An FDIC-supervised institution using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.</P>
              <P>(c) An FDIC-supervised institution must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the FDIC for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the FDIC-supervised institution and the FDIC to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the FDIC will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the FDIC-supervised institution's covered positions. The FDIC-supervised institution must retain and make available to the FDIC the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:</P>
              <P>(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;</P>
              <P>(2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and</P>
              <P>(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for stressed VaR-based measure.</E> (1) An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a stressed VaR-based measure for its covered positions using the same model(s) used to calculate the VaR-based measure, subject to the same confidence level and holding period applicable to the VaR-based measure under § 324.205, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the FDIC-supervised institution's current portfolio.</P>
              <P>(2) The stressed VaR-based measure must be calculated at least weekly and be no less than the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure.</P>
              <P>(3) An FDIC-supervised institution must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the FDIC-supervised institution's stressed VaR-based measure under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The FDIC-supervised institution must obtain the prior approval of the FDIC for, and notify the FDIC if the FDIC-supervised institution makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must address:</P>

              <P>(i) How the FDIC-supervised institution links the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure to the composition and directional bias of its current portfolio; and<PRTPAGE P="378"/>

              <P>(4) Nothing in this section prevents the FDIC from requiring an FDIC-supervised institution to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of the stressed VaR-based measure.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Modeled specific risk.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution may use models to measure the specific risk of covered positions as provided in § 324.205(a) (therefore, excluding securitization positions that are not modeled under § 324.209). An FDIC-supervised institution must use models to measure the specific risk of correlation trading positions that are modeled under § 324.209.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Requirements for specific risk modeling.</E> (i) If an FDIC-supervised institution uses internal models to measure the specific risk of a portfolio, the internal models must:</P>
              <P>(A) Explain the historical price variation in the portfolio;</P>
              <P>(B) Be responsive to changes in market conditions;</P>

              <P>(D) Capture all material components of specific risk for the debt and equity positions in the portfolio. Specifically, the internal models must:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Capture event risk and idiosyncratic risk; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Capture and demonstrate sensitivity to material differences between positions that are similar but not identical and to changes in portfolio composition and concentrations.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an FDIC-supervised institution calculates an incremental risk measure for a portfolio of debt or equity positions under § 324.208, the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to capture default and credit migration risks in its internal models used to measure the specific risk of those portfolios.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under § 324.207(b) using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the FDIC-supervised institution's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the FDIC, an FDIC-supervised institution may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the FDIC-supervised institution internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included <PRTPAGE P="379"/>in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position. An FDIC-supervised institution may not include correlation trading positions or securitization positions in its incremental risk measure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for incremental risk modeling.</E> For purposes of calculating the incremental risk measure, the incremental risk model must:</P>
              <P>(1) Measure incremental risk over a one-year time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.</P>
              <P>(i) A constant level of risk assumption means that the FDIC-supervised institution rebalances, or rolls over, its trading positions at the beginning of each liquidity horizon over the one-year horizon in a manner that maintains the FDIC-supervised institution's initial risk level. The FDIC-supervised institution must determine the frequency of rebalancing in a manner consistent with the liquidity horizons of the positions in the portfolio. The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for an FDIC-supervised institution to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions may not be less than the shorter of three months or the contractual maturity of the position.</P>
              <P>(ii) A constant position assumption means that the FDIC-supervised institution maintains the same set of positions throughout the one-year horizon. If an FDIC-supervised institution uses this assumption, it must do so consistently across all portfolios.</P>
              <P>(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution's selection of a constant position or a constant risk assumption must be consistent between the FDIC-supervised institution's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in § 324.209, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(iv) An FDIC-supervised institution's treatment of liquidity horizons must be consistent between the FDIC-supervised institution's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in § 324.209, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) Recognize the impact of correlations between default and migration events among obligors.</P>

              <P>(5) Reflect any material mismatch between a position and its hedge.</P>
              <P>(6) Recognize the effect that liquidity horizons have on dynamic hedging strategies. In such cases, an FDIC-supervised institution must:</P>
              <P>(i) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;</P>
              <P>(iii) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Capture in the incremental risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies.</P>
              <P>(7) Reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behavior with respect to default and migration changes.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a total specific risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and equity positions for which the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk and for all securitization positions that are not modeled under § 324.209. An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other definition or requirement in this subpart, a position that would have qualified as a debt position or an equity position but for the fact that it qualifies as a correlation trading position under paragraph (2) of the definition of correlation trading position in § 324.2, shall be considered a debt position or an equity position, respectively, for purposes of this § 324.210.</P>
              <P>(1) The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents sold credit protection is capped at the notional amount of the credit derivative contract. The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the current fair value of the transaction plus the absolute value of the present value of all remaining payments to the protection seller under the transaction. This sum is equal to the value of the protection leg of the transaction.</P>
              <P>(2) For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with linear payoffs, an FDIC-supervised institution must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or index portfolio, except for a securitization position for which the FDIC-supervised institution directly calculates a specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, an FDIC-supervised institution must risk weight the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative's delta.</P>
              <P>(3) For debt, equity, or securitization positions, an FDIC-supervised institution may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. An FDIC-supervised institution may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution includes the costs of conversion.</P>
              <P>(4) A set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge has a specific risk add-on of zero if:</P>
              <P>(i) The debt or securitization position is fully hedged by a total return swap (or similar instrument where there is a matching of swap payments and changes in fair value of the debt or securitization position);</P>
              <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the swap and the debt or securitization position;</P>
              <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the swap and the debt or securitization position; and</P>

              <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the swap <PRTPAGE P="382"/>and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in cases where a total return swap references a portfolio of positions with different maturity dates, the total return swap maturity date must match the maturity date of the underlying asset in that portfolio that has the latest maturity date.</P>
              <P>(5) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is equal to 20.0 percent of the capital requirement for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on when:</P>
              <P>(i) The credit risk of the position is fully hedged by a credit default swap or similar instrument;</P>
              <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position;</P>

              <P>(A) The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is within 30 business days of the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or</P>
              <P>(B) For purchased credit protection, the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is later than the maturity date of the debt or securitization position, but is no later than the standard maturity date for that instrument that immediately follows the maturity date of the debt or securitization position. The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge may not exceed the maturity date of the debt or securitization position by more than 90 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(6) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, but in which all or substantially all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal to the specific risk add-on for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Debt and securitization positions.</E> (1) The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of debt or securitization positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons for individual debt or securitization positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on for individual debt or securitization positions, an FDIC-supervised institution must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short debt or securitization position in the portfolio by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purpose of this section, the appropriate specific risk-weighting factors include:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Sovereign debt positions.</E> (A) In accordance with Table 1 to § 324.210, an FDIC-supervised institution must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a sovereign debt position based on the CRC applicable to the sovereign, and, as applicable, the remaining contractual maturity of the position, or if there is no CRC applicable to the sovereign, based on whether the sovereign entity is a member of the OECD. Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, sovereign debt positions that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States are treated as having a CRC of 0.</P>

An FDIC-supervised institution must make timely public disclosures each calendar quarter. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reporting amounts are no longer reflective of the FDIC-supervised institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If an FDIC-supervised institution believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed. The FDIC-supervised institution's management may provide all of the disclosures required by this section in one place on the FDIC-supervised institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the FDIC-supervised institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>

The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management must ensure that appropriate verification of the disclosures takes place and that effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. One or more senior officers of the FDIC-supervised institution must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart, and the board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this section.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Section 38 of the FDI Act establishes a framework of supervisory actions for insured depository institutions that are not adequately capitalized. The principal purpose of this subpart is to define, for FDIC-supervised institutions, the capital measures and capital levels, and for insured branches of foreign banks, comparable asset-based measures and levels, that are used for determining the supervisory actions authorized under section 38 of the FDI Act. This subpart also establishes procedures for submission and review of capital restoration plans and for issuance and review of directives and orders pursuant to section 38 of the FDI Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Until January 1, 2015, subpart B of part 325 of this chapter will continue to apply to banks and insured branches of foreign banks for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency. Until January 1, 2015, subpart Y of part 390 of this chapter will continue to apply to state savings associations. Beginning on, and thereafter, January 1, 2015, this subpart H implements the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act as they apply to FDIC-supervised institutions and insured branches of foreign banks for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency. Certain of these provisions also apply to officers, directors and employees of those insured institutions. In addition, certain provisions of this subpart apply to all insured depository <PRTPAGE P="397"/>institutions that are deemed critically undercapitalized.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other supervisory authority.</E> Neither section 38 of the FDI Act nor this subpart H in any way limits the authority of the FDIC under any other provision of law to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, deficient capital levels, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. Action under section 38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the FDIC, including issuance of cease and desist orders, capital directives, approval or denial of applications or notices, assessment of civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disclosure of capital categories.</E> The assignment of an FDIC-supervised institution or an insured branch of a foreign bank for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency under this subpart H within a particular capital category is for purposes of implementing and applying the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act. Unless permitted by the FDIC or otherwise required by law, no FDIC-supervised institution or insured branch of a foreign bank for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency may state in any advertisement or promotional material its capital category under this subpart H or that the FDIC or any other Federal banking agency has assigned it to a particular capital category.</P>

              <P>(ii) The term total assets shall have the meaning provided in 12 CFR 325.2(x).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing.</E> The calculation of the definitions of common equity tier 1 capital, the common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the leverage ratio, the supplementary leverage ratio, tangible equity, tier 1 capital, the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total assets, total leverage exposure, the total risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-weighted assets under this subpart H is subject to the timing provisions at 12 CFR 324.1(f) and the transitions at 12 CFR part 324, subpart G.</P>
              <P>(g) For purposes of subpart H, as of January 1, 2015, total assets means quarterly average total assets as reported in an FDIC-supervised institution's Call Report, minus amounts deducted from tier 1 capital under § 324.22(a), (c), and (d). At its discretion, the FDIC may calculate total assets using an FDIC-supervised institution's period-end assets rather than quarterly average assets.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Schedule for filing plan</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution shall file a written capital restoration plan with the appropriate FDIC regional director within 45 days of the <PRTPAGE P="400"/>date that the FDIC-supervised institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the FDIC-supervised institution is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, unless the FDIC notifies the FDIC-supervised institution in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. An adequately capitalized FDIC-supervised institution that has been required pursuant to § 324.403(d) to comply with supervisory actions as if the FDIC-supervised institution were undercapitalized is not required to submit a capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional capital restoration plans.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution that has already submitted and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved under section 38 and this subpart H is not required to submit an additional capital restoration plan based on a revised calculation of its capital measures or a reclassification of the institution under § 324.403 unless the FDIC notifies the FDIC-supervised institution that it must submit a new or revised capital plan. An FDIC-supervised institution that is notified that it must submit a new or revised capital restoration plan shall file the plan in writing with the appropriate FDIC regional director within 45 days of receiving such notice, unless the FDIC notifies it in writing that the plan must be filed within a different period.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of plan.</E> All financial data submitted in connection with a capital restoration plan shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided on the Call Report, unless the FDIC instructs otherwise. The capital restoration plan shall include all of the information required to be filed under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act. An FDIC-supervised institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan as a result of its reclassification pursuant to § 324.403(d) shall include a description of the steps the FDIC-supervised institution will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice. No plan shall be accepted unless it includes any performance guarantee described in section 38(e)(2)(C) of the FDI Act by each company that controls the FDIC-supervised institution.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of capital restoration plans.</E> Within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan under this subpart, the FDIC shall provide written notice to the FDIC-supervised institution of whether the plan has been approved. The FDIC may extend the time within which notice regarding approval of a plan shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disapproval of capital plan.</E> If a capital restoration plan is not approved by the FDIC, the FDIC-supervised institution shall submit a revised capital restoration plan within the time specified by the FDIC. Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration plan has not been approved, any undercapitalized FDIC-supervised institution (as defined in § 324.403(b)) shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable until such time as a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted by the FDIC-supervised institution has been approved by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to submit capital restoration plan.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that is undercapitalized (as defined in § 324.403(b)) and that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the period provided in this section shall, upon the expiration of that period, be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this subpart applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure to implement capital restoration plan.</E> Any undercapitalized FDIC-supervised institution that fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Amendment of capital restoration plan.</E> An FDIC-supervised institution that has filed an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to and approval by the FDIC, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, the FDIC-supervised institution shall <PRTPAGE P="401"/>implement the capital restoration plan as approved prior to the proposed amendment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Performance guarantee by companies that control an FDIC-supervised institution</E>—(1) <E T="03">Limitation on liability</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amount limitation.</E> The aggregate liability under the guarantee provided under section 38 and this subpart H for all companies that control a specific FDIC-supervised institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan under this subpart H shall be limited to the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(A) An amount equal to 5.0 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total assets at the time the FDIC-supervised institution was notified or deemed to have notice that the FDIC-supervised institution was undercapitalized; or</P>
              <P>(B) The amount necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of the FDIC-supervised institution to the levels required for the FDIC-supervised institution to be classified as adequately capitalized, as those capital measures and levels are defined at the time that the FDIC-supervised institution initially fails to comply with a capital restoration plan under this subpart H.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Limit on duration.</E> The guarantee and limit of liability under section 38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H shall expire after the FDIC notifies the FDIC-supervised institution that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The expiration or fulfillment by a company of a guarantee of a capital restoration plan shall not limit the liability of the company under any guarantee required or provided in connection with any capital restoration plan filed by the same FDIC-supervised institution after expiration of the first guarantee.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Collection on guarantee.</E> Each company that controls a given FDIC-supervised institution shall be jointly and severally liable for the guarantee for such FDIC-supervised institution as required under section 38 and this subpart H, and the FDIC may require and collect payment of the full amount of that guarantee from any or all of the companies issuing the guarantee.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to provide guarantee.</E> In the event that an FDIC-supervised institution that is controlled by any company submits a capital restoration plan that does not contain the guarantee required under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act, the FDIC-supervised institution shall, upon submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this subpart H that are applicable to FDIC-supervised institutions that have not submitted an acceptable capital restoration plan.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to perform guarantee.</E> Failure by any company that controls an FDIC-supervised institution to perform fully its guarantee of any capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the plan for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure, the FDIC-supervised institution shall be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this subpart H that are applicable to FDIC-supervised institutions that have failed in a material respect to implement a capital restoration plan.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part implements 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(2), which requires the Corporation (in coordination with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Federal Insurance Office) to issue regulations that require each covered bank to conduct periodic stress tests, and establishes a definition of stress test, methodologies for conducting stress tests, and reporting and disclosure requirements.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of authority.</E> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, the Corporation may modify some or all of the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) The Corporation may accelerate or extend any deadline for stress testing, reporting, or publication of the stress test results.</P>
            <P>(2) The Corporation may require different or additional tests not otherwise required by this part or may require or permit different or additional analytical techniques and methodologies, different or additional scenarios (including components for the scenarios), or different assumptions for the covered bank to use in meeting the requirements of this part. In addition, the FDIC may specify a different as-of date for any or all categories of financial data used by the stress test.</P>
            <P>(3) The Corporation may modify the reporting requirements of a report under this part or may require additional reports. The Corporation may modify the publication requirements of this part and or may require different or additional publication disclosures.</P>
            <P>(4) The Corporation may also exempt a covered bank from the requirement to conduct a stress test in a particular reporting year.</P>
            <P>(5) Factors considered: Any exercise of authority under this section by the Corporation will be in writing and will consider the activities, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, and the regulatory capital of the covered bank, in addition to any other relevant factors.</P>
            <P>(6) Notice and comment procedures: In exercising its authority to require different or additional stress tests and different or additional scenarios (including components for the scenarios) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Corporation will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 324.5, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(7) Nothing in this part limits the authority of the Corporation under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe and unsound practices or conditions, or violations of law or regulation.</P>

              <P>(2) Insured depository institutions shall access their quarterly certified statement invoices via FDIC<E T="03">connect</E>, unless the FDIC provides notice to insured depository institutions of a successor system. In the event of a contingency, the FDIC may employ an alternative means of delivering the quarterly certified statement invoices.

              </P>

              <P>(3) Institutions that do not have Internet access may request a renewable one-year exemption from the requirement that quarterly certified statement invoices be accessed through FDIC<E T="03">connect.</E> Any exemption request must be submitted in writing to the Manager of the Assessments Section.</P>

              <P>(4) Each assessment period, the FDIC will provide courtesy e-mail notification to insured depository institutions indicating that new quarterly certified statement invoices are available and may be accessed on FDIC<E T="03">connect.</E> E-mail notification will be sent to all individuals with FDIC<E T="03">connect</E> access to quarterly certified statement invoices.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Retention by institution.</E> If the appropriate officer of the insured depository institution agrees that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the information shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice is true, correct, and complete and in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations issued under it, the institution shall pay the amount specified on the quarterly certified statement invoice and shall retain it in the institution's files for three years as specified in section 7(b)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Amendment by institution.</E> If the appropriate officer of the insured depository institution determines that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the information shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice is not true, correct, and complete and in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations issued under it, the institution shall pay the amount specified on the quarterly certified statement invoice, and may:</P>
              <P>(1) Amend its report of condition, or other similar report, to correct any data believed to be inaccurate on the quarterly certified statement invoice; amendments to such reports timely filed under section 7(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act but not permitted to be made by an institution's primary federal regulator may be filed with the FDIC for consideration in determining deposit insurance assessments; or</P>

              <P>(2) The assessment rate on the quarterly certified statement invoice shall be amended only if it is inconsistent with the assessment risk assignment(s) provided to the institution by the Corporation for the assessment period in question pursuant to § 327.4(a). Agreement with the assessment rate shall not be deemed to constitute agreement with the assessment risk assignment.

Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the invoiced amount on the quarterly certified statement invoice shall be the product of the following: the assessment base of the institution for the prior quarter computed in accordance with § 327.5 multiplied by the institution's rate for that prior quarter as assigned to the institution pursuant to § 327.4(a) and § 327.9 or § 327.16.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Quarterly payment date and manner.</E> The Corporation will cause the amount stated in the applicable quarterly certified statement invoice to be directly debited on the appropriate payment date from the deposit account designated by the insured depository institution for that purpose, as follows:</P>

              <P>(iv) In the case of the assessment payment for the quarter that begins on October 1, the payment date is the following March 30.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Necessary action, sufficient funding by institution.</E> Each insured depository institution shall take all actions necessary to allow the Corporation to debit assessments from the insured depository institution's designated deposit account. Each insured depository institution shall, prior to each payment date indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, ensure that funds in an amount at least equal to the amount on the quarterly certified statement invoice are available in the designated account for direct debit by the Corporation. Failure to take any such action or to provide such funding of the account shall be deemed to constitute nonpayment of the assessment. Penalties for failure to timely pay assessments will be calculated and published in accordance with 12 CFR 308.132(d).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Business days.</E> If a payment date specified in paragraph (b)(2) falls on a date that is not a business day, the applicable date shall be the previous business day.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment adjustments in succeeding quarters.</E> Quarterly certified statement invoices provided by the Corporation may reflect adjustments, initiated by the Corporation or an institution, resulting from such factors as amendments to prior quarterly reports of condition, retroactive revision of the institution's assessment risk assignment, and revision of the Corporation's assessment computations for prior quarters.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Request for revision of computation of quarterly assessment payment</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An institution may submit a written request for revision of the computation of the institution's quarterly assessment payment as shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice in the following circumstances:</P>

              </P>
              <P>(ii) The institution determines that the rate applied by the Corporation is inconsistent with the assessment risk assignment(s) provided to the institution in writing by the Corporation for the assessment period for which the payment is due; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The institution believes that the quarterly certified statement invoice does not fully or accurately reflect adjustments provided for in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inapplicability.</E> This paragraph (f) is not applicable to requests for review of an institution's assessment risk assignment, which are covered by § 327.4(c) of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> Any such request for revision must be submitted within 90 days from the date the computation being challenged appears on the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice. The request for revision shall be submitted to the Manager of the Assessments Section and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the change sought by the institution. If additional information is requested by the Corporation, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the request for additional information. Any institution submitting a timely request for revision will receive written notice from the Corporation regarding the outcome of its request. Upon completion of a review, the DOF Director (or designee) shall promptly notify the institution in writing of his or her determination of whether revision is warranted. If the institution requesting revision disagrees with that determination, it may appeal to the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee.

              <SUBJECT>Assessment rates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Assessment risk assignment.</E> For the purpose of determining the annual assessment rate for insured depository institutions under § 327.9 or § 327.16 , each insured depository institution will be provided an assessment risk assignment. Notice of an institution's current assessment risk assignment will be provided to the institution with each quarterly certified statement invoice. Adjusted assessment risk assignments for prior periods may also be provided by the Corporation. Notice of the procedures applicable to reviews will be included with the notice of assessment risk assignment provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment of assessment at rate assigned.</E> Institutions shall make timely payment of assessments based on the assessment risk assignment in the notice provided to the institution pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Timely payment is required notwithstanding any request for review filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Assessment risk assignments remain in effect for future assessment periods until changed. If the risk assignment in the notice is subsequently changed, any excess assessment paid by the institution will be credited by the Corporation, with interest, and any additional assessment owed shall be paid by the institution, with interest, in the next assessment payment after such subsequent assignment or change. Interest payable under this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with § 327.7.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for review.</E> An institution that believes any assessment risk assignment provided by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is incorrect and seeks to change it must submit a written request for review of that risk assignment. An institution cannot request review through <PRTPAGE P="414"/>this process of the CAMELS ratings assigned by its primary federal regulator or challenge the appropriateness of any such rating; each federal regulator has established procedures for that purpose. An institution may also request review of a determination by the FDIC to assess the institution as a large, highly complex, or a small institution (§§ 327.9(e)(3) and 327.16(f)(3)) or a determination by the FDIC that the institution is a new institution (§§ 327.9(f)(5) and 327.16(g)(5)). Any request for review must be submitted within 90 days from the date the assessment risk assignment being challenged pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section appears on the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice. The request shall be submitted to the Corporation's Director of the Division of Insurance and Research in Washington, DC, and shall include documentation sufficient to support the change sought by the institution. If additional information is requested by the Corporation, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the request for additional information. Any institution submitting a timely request for review will receive written notice from the Corporation regarding the outcome of its request. Upon completion of a review, the Director of the Division of Insurance and Research (or designee) or the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (or designee) or any successor divisions, as appropriate, shall promptly notify the institution in writing of his or her determination of whether a change is warranted. If the institution requesting review disagrees with that determination, it may appeal to the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee. Notice of the procedures applicable to appeals will be included with the written determination.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disclosure restrictions.</E> The portion of an assessment risk assignment provided to an institution by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that reflects any supervisory evaluation or confidential information is deemed to be exempt information within the scope of § 309.5(g)(8) of this chapter and, accordingly, is governed by the disclosure restrictions set out at § 309.6 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Limited use of assessment risk assignment.</E> Any assessment risk assignment provided to a depository institution under this part 327 is for purposes of implementing and operating the FDIC's risk-based assessment system. Unless permitted by the Corporation or otherwise required by law, no institution may state in any advertisement or promotional material, or in any other public place or manner, the assessment risk assignment provided to it pursuant to this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effective date for changes to risk assignment.</E> Changes to an insured institution's risk assignment resulting from a supervisory ratings change become effective as of the date of written notification to the institution by its primary federal regulator or state authority of its supervisory rating (even when the CAMELS component ratings have not been disclosed to the institution), if the FDIC, after taking into account other information that could affect the rating, agrees with the rating. If the FDIC does not agree, the FDIC will notify the institution of the FDIC's supervisory rating; resulting changes to an insured institution's risk assignment become effective as of the date of written notification to the institution by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Designated Reserve Ratio.</E> The designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund is 2 percent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assessment base.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Assessment base for all insured depository institutions.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the assessment base for an insured depository institution shall equal the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Average consolidated total assets defined and calculated.</E> Average consolidated total assets are defined in the schedule of quarterly averages in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, using either a daily averaging method or a weekly averaging method <PRTPAGE P="415"/>as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The amounts to be reported as daily averages are the sum of the gross amounts of consolidated total assets for each calendar day during the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The amounts to be reported as weekly averages are the sum of the gross amounts of consolidated total assets for each Wednesday during the quarter divided by the number of Wednesdays in the quarter. For days that an office of the reporting institution (or any of its subsidiaries or branches) is closed (e.g., Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), the amounts outstanding from the previous business day will be used. An office is considered closed if there are no transactions posted to the general ledger as of that date. For institutions that begin operating during the calendar quarter, the amounts to be reported as daily averages are the sum of the gross amounts of consolidated total assets for each calendar day the institution was operating during the quarter divided by the number of calendar days the institution was operating during the quarter.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Institutions that must report average consolidated total assets using a daily averaging method.</E> All insured depository institutions that report $1 billion or more in quarter-end consolidated total assets on their March 31, 2011 Consolidated Report of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Report (or successor report), and all institutions that become insured after March 31, 2011, shall report average consolidated total assets as of the close of business for each day of the calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Institutions that may report average consolidated total assets using a weekly averaging method.</E> All insured depository institutions that report less than $1 billion in quarter-end consolidated total assets on their March 31, 2011, Consolidated Report of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Report may report average consolidated total assets as an average of the balances as of the close of business on each Wednesday during the calendar quarter, or may at any time opt permanently to report average consolidated total assets on a daily basis as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Once an institution that reports average consolidated total assets using a weekly average reports average consolidated total assets equal to or greater than $1 billion for two consecutive quarters, it shall permanently report average consolidated total assets using daily averaging starting in the next quarter.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Mergers and consolidations.</E> The average calculation of the assets of the surviving or resulting institution in a merger or consolidation shall include the assets of all the merged or consolidated institutions for the days in the quarter prior to the merger or consolidation, whether reported by the daily or weekly method.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Average tangible equity defined and calculated.</E> Tangible equity is defined as Tier 1 capital.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Calculation of average tangible equity.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, average tangible equity shall be calculated using monthly averaging. Monthly averaging means the average of the three month-end balances within the quarter.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Alternate calculation of average tangible equity.</E> Institutions that report less than $1 billion in quarter-end consolidated total assets on their March 31, 2011 Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Reports may report average tangible equity using an end-of-quarter balance or may at any time opt permanently to report average tangible equity using a monthly average balance. An institution that reports average tangible equity using an end-of-quarter balance and reports average daily or weekly consolidated assets of $1 billion or more for two consecutive quarters shall permanently report average tangible equity using monthly averaging starting in the next quarter. Newly insured institutions shall report using monthly averaging.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Calculation of average tangible equity for the surviving institution in a merger or consolidation.</E> For the surviving institution in a merger or consolidation, Tier 1 capital shall be calculated as if the merger occurred on the first day of the quarter in which the merger or consolidation occurred.<PRTPAGE P="416"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Consolidated subsidiaries</E>—(i) <E T="03">Reporting for insured depository institutions with consolidated subsidiaries that are not insured depository institutions.</E> For insured institutions with consolidated subsidiaries that are not insured depository institutions, assets, including assets eliminated in consolidation, shall be calculated using a daily or weekly averaging method, corresponding to the daily or weekly averaging requirement of the parent institution. The Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income instructions in effect for the quarter for which data is being reported shall govern calculation of the average amount of subsidiaries' assets, including those assets eliminated in consolidation. An insured depository institution that reports average tangible equity using a monthly averaging method and that has subsidiaries that are not insured depository institutions shall use monthly average reporting for the subsidiaries. The monthly average data for these subsidiaries, however, may be calculated for the current quarter or for the prior quarter consistent with the method used to report average consolidated total assets and in conformity with Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income requirements. Once the method of reporting the subsidiaries' assets and tangible equity is chosen, however (current quarter or prior quarter), insured depository institutions cannot change the reporting method from quarter to quarter. An institution that reports consolidated assets and tangible equity using data for the prior quarter may switch to concurrent reporting on a permanent basis.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reporting for insured depository institutions with consolidated insured depository subsidiaries.</E> Insured depository institutions that consolidate with other insured depository institutions for financial reporting purposes shall report for the parent and for each subsidiary individually, daily average consolidated total assets or weekly average consolidated total assets, as appropriate under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) above, and tangible equity, without consolidating their insured depository institution subsidiaries into the calculations. Investments in insured depository institution subsidiaries should be included in total assets using the equity method of accounting.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Assessment base for banker's banks</E>—(1) <E T="03">Bankers bank defined.</E> A banker's bank for purposes of calculating deposit insurance assessments shall meet the definition of banker's bank as that term is used in 12 U.S.C. 24. Banker's banks that have funds from government capital infusion programs (such as TARP and the Small Business Lending Fund), and stock owned by the FDIC resulting from banks failures, as well as non-bank-owned stock resulting from equity compensation programs, are not thereby excluded from the definition of banker's banks.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Self-certification.</E> Institutions that meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall so certify to that effect each quarter on the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Report or successor report.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Assessment base calculation for banker's banks.</E> A banker's bank shall pay deposit insurance assessments on its assessment base as calculated in paragraph (a) of this section provided that it conducts 50 percent or more of its business with entities other than its parent holding company or entities other than those controlled (control has the same meaning as in section 3(w)(5) of the FDI Act) either directly or indirectly by its parent holding company. The assessment base will exclude the average (daily or weekly depending on how the institution calculates its average consolidated total assets) amount of reserve balances passed through to the Federal Reserve, the average amount of reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve for its own account (including all balances due from the Federal Reserve as described in the instructions to line 4 of Schedule RC-A of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income as of December 31, 2010), and the average amount of the institution's federal funds sold, but in no case shall the amount excluded exceed the sum of the bank's average amount of total deposits of commercial banks and other depository institutions in the United States and the average amount of its federal funds purchased.<PRTPAGE P="417"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment base for custodial banks</E>—(1) <E T="03">Custodial bank defined.</E> A custodial bank for purposes of calculating deposit insurance assessments shall be an insured depository institution with previous calendar-year trust assets (fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets, as described in the instructions to Schedule RC-T of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income) of at least $50 billion or an insured depository institution that derived more than 50 percent of its total revenue (interest income plus non-interest income) from trust activity over the previous calendar year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Assessment base calculation for custodial banks.</E> A custodial bank shall pay deposit insurance assessments on its assessment base as calculated in paragraph (a) of this section, but the FDIC will exclude from that assessment base the daily or weekly average (depending on how the bank reports its average consolidated total assets) of all asset types described in the instructions to lines 1, 2, and 3 of Schedule RC of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income with a standardized approach risk weight of 0 percent, regardless of maturity, plus 50 percent of those asset types described in the instructions to lines 1, 2, and 3 of Schedule RC of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income, with a standardized approach risk-weight greater than 0 and up to and including 20 percent, regardless of maturity, subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average (depending on how the bank reports its average consolidated total assets) value of all assets that serve as the basis for a deduction under this section cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits that are classified as transaction accounts in the instructions to Schedule RC-E of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income and that are identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account asset.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assessment base for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> Average consolidated total assets for an insured branch of a foreign bank are defined as total assets of the branch (including net due from related depository institutions) in accordance with the schedule of assets and liabilities in the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks as of the assessment period for which the assessment is being calculated, but measured using the definition for reporting total assets in the schedule of quarterly averages in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, and calculated using the appropriate daily or weekly averaging method under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. Tangible equity for an insured branch of a foreign bank is eligible assets (determined in accordance with § 347.210 of the FDIC's regulations) less the book value of liabilities (exclusive of liabilities due to the foreign bank's head office, other branches, agencies, offices, or wholly owned subsidiaries) calculated on a monthly or end-of-quarter basis, according to the branch's size.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Newly insured institutions.</E> A newly insured institution shall pay an assessment for the assessment period during which it became insured. The FDIC will prorate the newly insured institution's assessment amount to reflect the number of days it was insured during the period.</P>

Such institution shall not be required to certify its quarterly certified statement invoice and pay further assessments after it has paid in full its deposit liabilities and the assessment to the Corporation required to be paid for the assessment period in which its deposit liabilities are paid in full, and after it, under applicable law, goes out of business or transfers all or substantially all of its assets and liabilities to other institutions or otherwise ceases to be obliged to pay subsequent assessments.</P>

When the depository institution has unclaimed deposits, the certification shall further state the amount of the unclaimed deposits and the disposition made of the funds to be held to meet the claims. For assessment purposes, the following will be considered as payment of the unclaimed deposits:</P>
              <P>(i) The transfer of cash funds in an amount sufficient to pay the unclaimed and unpaid deposits to the public official authorized by law to receive the same; or</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice to depositors.</E> (i) The depository institution whose insured status is terminating shall give sufficient advance notice of the intended transfer to the owners of the unclaimed deposits to enable the depositors to obtain their deposits prior to the transfer. The notice shall be mailed to each depositor and shall be published in a local newspaper of general circulation. The notice shall advise the depositors of the liquidation of the depository institution, request them to call for and accept payment of their deposits, and state the disposition to be made of their deposits if they fail to promptly claim the deposits.</P>

The procedure for applying <PRTPAGE P="419"/>for the continuance or resumption of insured status is set forth in § 303.248 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) The relevant interest rate for a quarterly assessment interval will apply to any amounts overpaid or underpaid on the payment date immediately prior to the beginning of the quarterly assessment interval. The relevant interest rate will also apply to any amounts owed for previous overpayments or underpayments (including any interest thereon) that remain outstanding, after any adjustments to such overpayments or underpayments have been made thereon, at the end of the regular payment date immediately prior to the beginning of the quarterly assessment interval. Interest will be compounded daily.</P>

              <P>The following pricing methods shall apply through the later of June 30, 2016, or the subsequent calendar quarter in which the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches 1.15 percent.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Small institutions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Risk Categories.</E> Each small insured depository institution shall be assigned to one of the following four Risk Categories based upon the institution's capital evaluation and supervisory evaluation as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Risk Category I.</E> Small institutions in Supervisory Group A that are Well Capitalized will be assigned to Risk Category I.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Risk Category II.</E> Small institutions in Supervisory Group A that are Adequately Capitalized, and small institutions in Supervisory Group B that are either Well Capitalized or Adequately Capitalized will be assigned to Risk Category II.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Risk Category III.</E> Small institutions in Supervisory Groups A and B that are Undercapitalized, and small institutions in Supervisory Group C that are Well Capitalized or Adequately Capitalized will be assigned to Risk Category III.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Risk Category IV.</E> Small institutions in Supervisory Group C that are Undercapitalized will be assigned to Risk Category IV.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Capital evaluations.</E> Each small institution will receive one of the following three capital evaluations on the <PRTPAGE P="423"/>basis of data reported in the institution's Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Report (or successor report, as appropriate) dated as of March 31 for the assessment period beginning the preceding January 1; dated as of June 30 for the assessment period beginning the preceding April 1; dated as of September 30 for the assessment period beginning the preceding July 1; and dated as of December 31 for the assessment period beginning the preceding October 1.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Well Capitalized.</E> A Well Capitalized institution is one that satisfies each of the following capital ratio standards: Total risk-based capital ratio, 10.0 percent or greater; tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, 8.0 percent or greater; leverage ratio, 5.0 percent or greater; common equity tier 1 capital ratio, 6.5 percent or greater; and, if the institution is an insured depository institution subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards under 12 CFR 6.4(c)(1)(iv)(B), 12 CFR 208.43(c)(2)(iv)(B), or 12 CFR 324.403(b)(1)(v), as each may be amended from time to time, a supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0 percent or greater.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adequately Capitalized.</E> An Adequately Capitalized institution is one that does not satisfy the standards of Well Capitalized in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section but satisfies each of the following capital ratio standards: Total risk-based capital ratio, 8.0 percent or greater; tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, 6.0 percent or greater; leverage ratio, 4.0 percent or greater; common equity tier 1 capital ratio, 4.5 percent or greater; and, if the institution is subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules under 12 CFR 6.4(c)(2)(iv)(B), 12 CFR 208.43(c)(2)(iv)(B), or 12 CFR 324.403(b)(2)(vi), as each may be amended from time to time, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 percent or greater.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Undercapitalized.</E> An undercapitalized institution is one that does not qualify as either Well Capitalized or Adequately Capitalized under paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Supervisory evaluations.</E> Each small institution will be assigned to one of three Supervisory Groups based on the Corporation's consideration of supervisory evaluations provided by the institution's primary federal regulator. The supervisory evaluations include the results of examination findings by the primary federal regulator, as well as other information that the primary federal regulator determines to be relevant. In addition, the Corporation will take into consideration such other information (such as state examination findings, as appropriate) as it determines to be relevant to the institution's financial condition and the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The three Supervisory Groups are:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Supervisory Group “A.”</E> This Supervisory Group consists of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Supervisory Group “B.”</E> This Supervisory Group consists of institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which, if not corrected, could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund; and</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Supervisory Group “C.”</E> This Supervisory Group consists of institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund unless effective corrective action is taken.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Financial ratios method.</E> A small insured depository institution in Risk Category I shall have its initial base assessment rate determined using the financial ratios method.</P>

              <P>(i) Under the financial ratios method, each of six financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount. The resulting sum shall equal the institution's initial base assessment rate; provided, however, that no institution's initial base assessment rate shall be less than the minimum initial base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that quarter nor greater than the maximum initial base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that quarter. An institution's initial base assessment rate, subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, as appropriate (resulting in the institution's total base assessment rate, <PRTPAGE P="424"/>which in no case can be lower than 50 percent of the institution's initial base assessment rate), and adjusted for the actual assessment rates set by the Board under § 327.10(f), will equal an institution's assessment rate. The six financial ratios are: Leverage ratio; Loans past due 30-89 days/gross assets; Nonperforming assets/gross assets; Net loan charge-offs/gross assets; Net income before taxes/risk-weighted assets; and the Adjusted brokered deposit ratio. The ratios are defined in Table A.1 of Appendix A to this subpart. The ratios will be determined for an assessment period based upon information contained in an institution's report of condition filed as of the last day of the assessment period as set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The weighted average of CAMELS component ratings is created by multiplying each component by the following percentages and adding the products: Capital adequacy—25%, Asset quality—20%, Management—25%, Earnings—10%, Liquidity—10%, and Sensitivity to market risk—10%. The following table sets forth the initial values of the pricing multipliers:</P>

              <P>(A) <E T="03">Performance score for large institutions.</E> The performance score for large institutions is a weighted average of the scores for three measures: the weighted average CAMELS rating score, weighted at 30 percent; the ability to withstand asset-related stress score, weighted at 50 percent; and the ability to withstand funding-related stress score, weighted at 20 percent.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Weighted average CAMELS rating score.</E> (<E T="03">i</E>) To compute the weighted average CAMELS rating score, a weighted average of an institution's CAMELS component ratings is calculated using the following weights:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) A weighted average CAMELS rating converts to a score that ranges from 25 to 100. A weighted average rating of 1 equals a score of 25 and a weighted average of 3.5 or greater equals a score of 100. Weighted average CAMELS ratings between 1 and 3.5 are assigned a score between 25 and 100. The score increases at an increasing rate as the weighted average CAMELS rating increases. Appendix B of this subpart describes the conversion of a weighted average CAMELS rating to a score.</P>

Appendices A and C of this subpart define these measures.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The Leverage ratio and the ratio of core earnings to average quarter-end total assets are described in appendix A and the method of calculating the scores is described in appendix C of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The score for the concentration measure is the greater of the higher-risk assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves score or the growth-adjusted portfolio concentrations score. Both ratios are described in appendix C.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) The score for the credit quality measure is the greater of the criticized and classified items to Tier 1 capital and reserves score or the underperforming assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves score.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) The following table shows the cutoff values and weights for the measures used to calculate the ability to withstand asset-related stress score. Appendix B of this subpart describes how each measure is converted to a score between 0 and 100 based upon the minimum and maximum cutoff values, where a score of 0 reflects the lowest risk and a score of 100 reflects the highest risk.</P>

              <P>(ii) The scorecard for highly complex institutions produces two scores: performance and loss severity.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Performance score for highly complex institutions.</E> The performance score for highly complex institutions is the weighted average of the scores for three components: weighted average CAMELS rating, weighted at 30 percent; ability to withstand asset-related stress score, weighted at 50 percent; and ability to withstand funding-related stress score, weighted at 20 percent.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Weighted average CAMELS rating score.</E> (<E T="03">i</E>) To compute the score for the weighted average CAMELS rating, a weighted average of an institution's CAMELS component ratings is calculated using the following weights:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="120" SPAN="2">
                <GID>ER25FE11.008</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) A weighted average CAMELS rating converts to a score that ranges from 25 to 100. A weighted average rating of 1 equals a score of 25 and a weighted average of 3.5 or greater equals a score of 100. Weighted average CAMELS ratings between 1 and 3.5 are assigned a score between 25 and 100. The score increases at an increasing rate as the weighted average CAMELS <PRTPAGE P="429"/>rating increases. Appendix B of this subpart describes the conversion of a weighted average CAMELS rating to a score.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Ability to withstand asset-related stress score.</E> (<E T="03">i</E>) The ability to withstand asset-related stress score is a weighted average of the scores for four measures: Leverage ratio; concentration measure; ratio of core earnings to average quarter-end total assets; credit quality measure and market risk measure. Appendix A of this subpart describes these measures.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The Leverage ratio and the ratio of core earnings to average quarter-end total assets are described in appendix A and the method of calculating the scores is described in appendix B of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The score for the concentration measure for highly complex institutions is the greatest of the higher-risk assets to the sum of Tier 1 capital and reserves score, the top 20 counterparty exposure to the sum of Tier 1 capital and reserves score, or the largest counterparty exposure to the sum of Tier 1 capital and reserves score. Each ratio is described in appendix A of this subpart. The method used to convert the concentration measure into a score is described in appendix C of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) The credit quality score is the greater of the criticized and classified items to Tier 1 capital and reserves score or the underperforming assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves score. The market risk score is the weighted average of three scores—the trading revenue volatility to Tier 1 capital score, the market risk capital to Tier 1 capital score, and the level 3 trading assets to Tier 1 capital score. All of these ratios are described in appendix A of this subpart and the method of calculating the scores is described in appendix B. Each score is multiplied by its respective weight, and the resulting weighted score is summed to compute the score for the market risk measure. An overall weight of 35 percent is allocated between the scores for the credit quality measure and market risk measure. The allocation depends on the ratio of average trading assets to the sum of average securities, loans and trading assets (trading asset ratio) as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) Weight for credit quality score = 35 percent * (1—trading asset ratio); and,</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vi</E>) Weight for market risk score = 35 percent * trading asset ratio.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vii</E>) Each of the measures used to calculate the ability to withstand asset-related stress score is assigned the following cutoff values and weights:</P>

The loss severity score is converted into a loss severity factor that ranges from 0.8 (score of 5 or lower) to 1.2 (score of 85 or higher). Scores at or below the minimum cutoff of 5 receive a loss severity factor of 0.8, and scores at or above the maximum cutoff of 85 receive a loss severity factor of 1.2. The following linear interpolation converts loss severity scores between the cutoffs into a loss severity factor: (Loss Severity Factor = 0.8 + [0.005 * (Loss Severity Score − 5)]. The performance score is multiplied by the loss severity factor to produce a total score (total score = performance score * loss severity factor). The total score can be up to 20 percent higher or lower than the performance score but cannot be less than 30 or more than 90. The total score is subject to adjustment, up or down, by a maximum of 15 points, as set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

              <FP>where Rate is the initial base assessment rate (expressed in basis points), Maximum Rate is the maximum initial base assessment rate then in effect (expressed in basis points), and Minimum Rate is the minimum initial base assessment rate then in effect (expressed in basis points). Initial base assessment rates are subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (b)(3), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of this section; highly complex institutions that are not well capitalized or have a CAMELS composite rating of 3, 4 or 5 shall be subject to the adjustment at paragraph (d)(3); these adjustments shall result in the institution's total base assessment rate, which in no case can be lower than 50 percent of the institution's initial base assessment rate.</FP>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjustment to total score for large institutions and highly complex institutions.</E> The total score for large institutions and highly complex institutions is subject to adjustment, up or down, by a maximum of 15 points, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the appropriate scorecard. In making such adjustments, the FDIC may consider such information as financial performance and condition information and other market or supervisory information. The FDIC will also consult with an institution's primary federal regulator and, for state chartered institutions, state banking supervisor.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Prior notice of adjustments</E>—(A) <E T="03">Prior notice of upward adjustment.</E> Prior to making any upward adjustment to an institution's total score because of considerations of additional risk information, the FDIC will formally notify the institution and its primary federal regulator and provide an opportunity to respond. This notification will include the reasons for the adjustment and when the adjustment will take effect.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Prior notice of downward adjustment.</E> Prior to making any downward adjustment to an institution's total score because of considerations of additional risk information, the FDIC will formally notify the institution's primary federal regulator and provide an opportunity to respond.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Determination whether to adjust upward; effective period of adjustment.</E> After considering an institution's and the primary federal regulator's responses to the notice, the FDIC will determine whether the adjustment to an institution's total score is warranted, taking into account any revisions to scorecard measures, as well as any actions taken by the institution to address the FDIC's concerns described in the notice. The FDIC will evaluate the need for the adjustment each subsequent assessment period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the amount of adjustment cannot exceed the proposed adjustment amount contained in the initial notice unless additional notice is provided so that the primary federal regulator and the institution may respond.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Determination whether to adjust downward; effective period of adjustment.</E> After considering the primary federal regulator's responses to the notice, the FDIC will determine whether the adjustment to total score is warranted, taking into account any revisions to scorecard measures. Any downward adjustment in an institution's total score will remain in effect for subsequent assessment periods until the FDIC determines that an adjustment is no longer warranted. Downward adjustments will be made without notification to the institution. However, the FDIC will provide advance notice to an institution and its primary federal regulator and give them an opportunity to respond before removing a downward adjustment.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Adjustment without notice.</E> Notwithstanding the notice provisions set forth above, the FDIC may change an institution's total score without advance notice under this paragraph, if the institution's supervisory ratings or the scorecard measures deteriorate.<PRTPAGE P="432"/>

The weighted average ROCA rating will be multiplied by 5.076 (which shall be the pricing multiplier). To this result will be added a uniform amount. The resulting sum—the initial base assessment rate—will equal an institution's total base assessment rate; provided, however, that no institution's total base assessment rate will be less than the minimum total base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that quarter nor greater than the maximum total base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that quarter.</P>

              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Implementation of changes between Risk Categories for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> If, during a quarter, a ROCA rating change occurs that results in an insured branch of a foreign bank moving from Risk Category I to Risk Category II, III or IV, the institution's initial base assessment rate for the portion of the quarter that it was in Risk Category I shall be determined using the weighted average ROCA component rating. For the portion of the quarter that the institution was not in Risk Category I, the institution's initial base assessment rate shall be determined under the assessment schedule for the appropriate Risk Category. If, during a quarter, a ROCA rating change occurs that results in an insured branch of a foreign bank moving from Risk Category II, III or IV to Risk Category I, the institution's assessment rate for the portion of the quarter that it was in Risk Category I shall equal the rate determined as provided using the weighted average ROCA component rating. For the portion of the quarter that the institution was not in Risk Category I, the institution's initial base assessment rate shall be determined under the assessment schedule for the appropriate Risk Category.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Implementation of changes within Risk Category I for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> If, during a quarter, an insured branch of a foreign bank remains in Risk Category I, but a ROCA component rating changes that will affect the institution's initial base assessment rate, separate assessment rates for the portion(s) of the quarter before and after the change(s) shall be determined under this paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Unsecured debt adjustment to initial base assessment rate for all institutions.</E> All institutions, except new institutions as provided under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section and insured branches of foreign banks as provided under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, shall be subject to an adjustment of assessment rates for unsecured debt. Any unsecured debt adjustment shall be made after any adjustment under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of unsecured debt adjustment.</E> The unsecured debt adjustment shall be determined as the sum of the initial base assessment rate plus 40 basis points; that sum shall be multiplied by the ratio of an insured depository institution's long-term unsecured debt to its assessment base. The amount of the reduction in the assessment rate due to the adjustment is equal to the dollar amount of the adjustment divided by the amount of the assessment base.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Limitation</E>—No unsecured debt adjustment for any institution shall exceed the lesser of 5 basis points or 50 percent of the institution's initial base assessment rate.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Applicable quarterly reports of condition</E>—Unsecured debt adjustment ratios for any given quarter shall be calculated from quarterly reports of condition (Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income and Thrift Financial Reports, or any successor reports to either, as appropriate) filed by each institution as of the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Depository institution debt adjustment to initial base assessment rate for all institutions.</E> All institutions shall be subject to an adjustment of assessment rates for unsecured debt held that is issued by another depository institution. Any such depository institution debt adjustment shall be made after any adjustment under paragraphs (b)(3) and (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of depository institution debt adjustment.</E> An insured depository institution shall pay a 50 basis point adjustment on the amount of unsecured debt it holds that was issued by another insured depository institution to the extent that such debt exceeds 3 percent of the institution's Tier 1 capital. The amount of long-term unsecured debt issued by another insured depository institution shall be calculated using the same valuation methodology used to calculate the amount of such debt for reporting on the asset side of the balance sheets.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Applicable quarterly reports of condition.</E> Depository institution debt adjustment ratios for any given quarter shall be calculated from quarterly reports of condition (Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income and Thrift Financial Reports, or any successor reports to either, as appropriate) <PRTPAGE P="434"/>filed by each institution as of the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Brokered Deposit Adjustment.</E> All small institutions in Risk Categories II, III, and IV, all large institutions and all highly complex institutions, except large and highly complex institutions (including new large and new highly complex institutions) that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, shall be subject to an assessment rate adjustment for brokered deposits. Any such brokered deposit adjustment shall be made after any adjustment under paragraphs (b)(3), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of this section. The brokered deposit adjustment includes all brokered deposits as defined in Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831f), and 12 CFR 337.6, including reciprocal deposits as defined in § 327.8(p), and brokered deposits that consist of balances swept into an insured institution from another institution. The adjustment under this paragraph is limited to those institutions whose ratio of brokered deposits to domestic deposits is greater than 10 percent; asset growth rates do not affect the adjustment. Insured branches of foreign banks are not subject to the brokered deposit adjustment as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of brokered deposit adjustment.</E> The brokered deposit adjustment shall be determined by multiplying 25 basis points by the ratio of the difference between an insured depository institution's brokered deposits and 10 percent of its domestic deposits to its assessment base.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> The maximum brokered deposit adjustment will be 10 basis points; the minimum brokered deposit adjustment will be 0.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Applicable quarterly reports of condition.</E> Brokered deposit ratios for any given quarter shall be calculated from the quarterly reports of condition (Call Reports and Thrift Financial Reports, or any successor reports to either, as appropriate) filed by each institution as of the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Request to be treated as a large institution</E>—(1) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Any institution with assets of between $5 billion and $10 billion may request that the FDIC determine its assessment rate as a large institution. The FDIC will consider such a request provided that it has sufficient information to do so. Any such request must be made to the FDIC's Division of Insurance and Research. Any approved change will become effective within one year from the date of the request. If an institution whose request has been granted subsequently reports assets of less than $5 billion in its report of condition for four consecutive quarters, the institution shall be deemed a small institution for assessment purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time limit on subsequent request for alternate method.</E> An institution whose request to be assessed as a large institution is granted by the FDIC shall not be eligible to request that it be assessed as a small institution for a period of three years from the first quarter in which its approved request to be assessed as a large institution became effective. Any request to be assessed as a small institution must be made to the FDIC's Division of Insurance and Research.</P>
              <P>(3) An institution that disagrees with the FDIC's determination that it is a large, highly complex, or small institution may request review of that determination pursuant to § 327.4(c).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">New and established institutions and exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">New small institutions.</E> A new small Risk Category I institution shall be assessed the Risk Category I maximum initial base assessment rate for the relevant assessment period. No new small institution in any risk category shall be subject to the unsecured debt adjustment as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. All new small institutions in any Risk Category shall be subject to the depository institution debt adjustment as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. All new small institutions in Risk Categories II, III, and IV shall be subject to the brokered deposit adjustment as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">New large institutions and new highly complex institutions.</E> All new large institutions and all new highly complex institutions shall be assessed under the appropriate method provided at paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section and subject to the adjustments provided at paragraphs (b)(3), (d)(2), and <PRTPAGE P="435"/>(d)(3) of this section. No new highly complex or large institutions are entitled to adjustment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If a large or highly complex institution has not yet received CAMELS ratings, it will be given a weighted CAMELS rating of 2 for assessment purposes until actual CAMELS ratings are assigned.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">CAMELS ratings for the surviving institution in a merger or consolidation.</E> When an established institution merges with or consolidates into a new institution, if the FDIC determines the resulting institution to be an established institution under § 327.8(k)(1), its CAMELS ratings for assessment purposes will be based upon the established institution's ratings prior to the merger or consolidation until new ratings become available.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Rate applicable to institutions subject to subsidiary or credit union exception.</E> A small Risk Category I institution that is established under § 327.8(k)(4) or (5), but does not have CAMELS component ratings, shall be assessed at 2 basis points above the minimum initial base assessment rate applicable to Risk Category I institutions until it receives CAMELS component ratings. Thereafter, the assessment rate will be determined by annualizing, where appropriate, financial ratios obtained from all quarterly reports of condition that have been filed, until the institution files four quarterly reports of condition. If a large or highly complex institution is considered established under § 327.8(k)(4) or (5), but does not have CAMELS component ratings, it will be given a weighted CAMELS rating of 2 for assessment purposes until actual CAMELS ratings are assigned.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> An institution that disagrees with the FDIC's determination that it is a new institution may request review of that determination pursuant to § 327.4(c).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Assessment rates for bridge depository institutions and conservatorships.</E> Institutions that are bridge depository institutions under 12 U.S.C. 1821(n) and institutions for which the Corporation has been appointed or serves as conservator shall, in all cases, be assessed at the Risk Category I minimum initial base assessment rate, which shall not be subject to adjustment under paragraphs (b)(3), (d)(1), (2) or (3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(v) <E T="03">Surcharge base—institution's portion.</E> For purposes of paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, an institution's portion shall equal the ratio of the institution's deposit insurance assessment base for the assessment period, determined according to § 327.5, to the sum of the institution's deposit insurance assessment base for the assessment period, determined according to § 327.5, and the deposit insurance assessment bases for the assessment period, determined according to § 327.5, of all of the institution's affiliated insured depository institutions subject to the surcharge.</P>
              <P>(vi) For the purposes of this section, an affiliated insured depository institution is an insured depository institution that meets the definition of “affiliate” in section 3 of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(6).</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Effect of mergers and consolidations on surcharge base.</E> (i) If an insured depository institution acquires another insured depository institution through merger or consolidation during the surcharge period, the acquirer's surcharge base will be calculated consistent with § 327.6 and § 327.11(a)(5). For the purposes of the surcharge, a merger or consolidation means any transaction in which an insured depository institution merges or consolidates with any other insured depository institution, and includes transactions in which an insured depository institution either directly or indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the assets, or assumes all or substantially all of the deposit liabilities of any other insured depository institution where there is not a legal merger or consolidation of the two insured depository institutions.</P>

              <P>(ii) If an insured depository institution not subject to the surcharge is the surviving or resulting institution in a merger or consolidation with an insured depository institution that is subject to the surcharge or acquires all <PRTPAGE P="446"/>or substantially all of the assets, or assumes all or substantially all of the deposit liabilities, of an insured depository institution subject to the surcharge, then the surviving or resulting insured deposit institution or the insured depository institution that acquires such assets or assumes such deposit liabilities is subject to the surcharge.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Shortfall assessment.</E>—(1) <E T="03">Institutions subject to shortfall assessment.</E> Any insured depository institution that was subject to a surcharge under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in any assessment period during the surcharge period described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, shall be subject to the shortfall assessment described in this paragraph (b). If surcharges under paragraph (a) of this section have not been in effect, the insured depository institutions subject to the shortfall assessment described in this paragraph (b) will be the insured depository institutions described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section as of the assessment period in which the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification of shortfall.</E> The FDIC shall notify each insured depository institution subject to the shortfall assessment of the amount of such institution's share of the shortfall assessment described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section no later than 15 days before such shortfall assessment is due, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment of any shortfall assessment.</E> Each insured depository institution subject to the shortfall assessment shall pay to the Corporation such institution's share of any shortfall assessment as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section in compliance with and subject to the provisions of §§ 327.3, 327.6 and 327.7. The payment date for any shortfall assessment shall be the date provided in § 327.3(b)(2) for the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the assessment period in which the shortfall assessment is imposed.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Amount of aggregate shortfall assessment.</E> (i) If the reserve ratio of the DIF is at least 1.15 percent but has not reached or exceeded 1.35 percent as of December 31, 2018, the shortfall assessment shall be imposed on March 31, 2019, and shall equal 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits as of December 31, 2018, minus the actual DIF balance as of that date.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the reserve ratio of the DIF is less than 1.15 percent and has not reached or exceeded 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, the shortfall assessment shall be imposed at the end of the assessment period immediately following the assessment period that occurs after December 31, 2018, during which the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent and shall equal 0.2 percent of estimated insured deposits as of the end of the calendar quarter in which the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Institutions' shares of aggregate shortfall assessment.</E> Each insured depository institution's share of the aggregate shortfall assessment shall be determined by apportioning the aggregate amount of the shortfall assessment among all institutions subject to the shortfall assessment in proportion to each institution's shortfall assessment base as described in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Shortfall assessment base if surcharges have been in effect.</E> If surcharges have been in effect, an institution's shortfall assessment base shall equal the average of the institution's surcharge bases during the surcharge period. For purposes of determining the average surcharge base, if an institution was not subject to the surcharge during any assessment period of the surcharge period, its surcharge base shall equal zero for that assessment period.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Shortfall assessment base if surcharges have not been in effect.</E> If surcharges have not been in effect, an institution's shortfall assessment base shall equal the average of what its surcharge bases would have been over the four assessment periods ending with the assessment period in which the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent. If an institution would not have been subject to a surcharge during one of those assessment periods, its surcharge base shall equal zero for that assessment period.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Effect of mergers and consolidations on shortfall assessment.</E> (i) If an insured <PRTPAGE P="447"/>depository institution, through merger or consolidation, acquires another insured depository institution that paid surcharges for one or more assessment periods, the acquirer will be subject to a shortfall assessment and its average surcharge base will be increased by the average surcharge base of the acquired institution, consistent with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the purposes of the shortfall assessment, a merger or consolidation means any transaction in which an insured depository institution merges or consolidates with any other insured depository institution, and includes transactions in which an insured depository institution either directly or indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the assets, or assumes all or substantially all of the deposit liabilities of any other insured depository institution where there is not a legal merger or consolidation of the two insured depository institutions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment credits.</E> (1)(i) <E T="03">Eligible Institutions.</E> For the purposes of this paragraph (c) an insured depository institution will be considered an eligible institution, if, for at least one assessment period during the credit calculation period, the institution was a credit accruing institution.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Credit accruing institutions.</E> A credit accruing institution is an institution that, for a particular assessment period, is not:</P>
              <P>(A) A large institution, as defined in § 327.8(f);</P>
              <P>(B) A highly complex institution, as defined in § 327.8(g); or</P>
              <P>(C) An insured branch of a foreign bank whose assets are equal to or exceed $10 billion, as reported in Schedule RAL of the branch's most recent quarterly Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Credit calculation period.</E> The credit calculation period shall begin the first day of the assessment period after the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent, and shall continue through the earlier of the assessment period that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches or exceeds 1.35 percent or the assessment period that ends December 31, 2018.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Determination of aggregate assessment credit awards to all eligible institutions.</E> The FDIC shall award an aggregate amount of assessment credits equal to the product of the <E T="03">fraction of quarterly regular deposit insurance assessments paid by credit accruing institutions</E> during the credit calculation period and the amount by which the <E T="03">DIF increase,</E> as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, exceeds total surcharges imposed under paragraph (b) of this section; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of assessment credits cannot exceed the aggregate amount of quarterly deposit insurance assessments paid by credit accruing institutions during the credit calculation period.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fraction of quarterly regular deposit insurance assessments paid by credit accruing institutions.</E> The fraction of assessments paid by credit accruing institutions shall equal quarterly deposit insurance assessments, as determined under §§ 327.9 and 327.16, paid by such institutions for each assessment period during the credit calculation period, divided by the total amount of quarterly deposit insurance assessments paid by all insured depository institutions during the credit calculation period, excluding the aggregate amount of surcharges imposed under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">DIF increase if the DIF reserve ratio has reached 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018.</E> If the DIF reserve ratio has reached 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, the DIF increase shall equal 0.2 percent of estimated insured deposits as of the date that the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35 percent.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">DIF Increase if the DIF reserve ratio has not reached 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018.</E> If the DIF reserve ratio has not reached 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, the DIF increase shall equal the DIF balance on December 31, 2018, minus 1.15 percent of estimated insured deposits on that date.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Determination of individual eligible institutions' shares of aggregate assessment Credit.</E>—</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Assessment credit share.</E> To determine an eligible institution's assessment credit share, the aggregate assessment credits awarded by the FDIC <PRTPAGE P="448"/>shall be apportioned among all eligible institutions in proportion to their respective assessment credit bases, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Assessment credit base.</E> An eligible institution's assessment credit base shall equal the average of its quarterly deposit insurance assessment bases, as determined under § 327.5, during the credit calculation period, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An eligible institution's credit base shall be deemed to equal zero for any assessment period during which the institution was not a credit accruing institution.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> The assessment credits awarded to an eligible institution shall not exceed the total amount of quarterly deposit insurance assessments paid by that institution for assessment periods during the credit calculation period in which it was a credit accruing institution.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Effect of merger or consolidation on assessment credit base.</E> If an eligible institution acquires another eligible institution through merger or consolidation before the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches 1.35 percent, the acquirer's quarterly deposit insurance assessment base (for purposes of calculating the acquirer's assessment credit base) shall be deemed to include the acquired institution's deposit insurance assessment base for the assessment periods during the credit calculation period that were prior to the merger or consolidation and in which the acquired institution was a credit accruing institution.</P>

Adjustments to an insured depository institution's assessment credit amounts will not be applied retroactively to reduce or increase the quarterly deposit insurance assessment for a prior assessment period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prepayment of quarterly risk-based assessments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement to prepay assessment.</E> On December 30, 2009, each insured depository institution shall pay to the FDIC a prepaid assessment, which shall equal its estimated quarterly risk-based assessments aggregated for the fourth quarter of 2009, and all of 2010, <PRTPAGE P="450"/>2011, and 2012 (the “prepayment period”).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculation of prepaid assessment—</E> (1) <E T="03">Prepaid assessment—</E> (i) <E T="03">Fourth quarter 2009 and all of 2010.</E> An institution's prepaid assessment for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 shall be determined by multiplying its prepaid assessment rate as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section times the corresponding prepaid assessment base for each quarter as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">All of 2011 and 2012.</E> An institution's prepaid assessment for each quarter of 2011 and 2012 shall be determined by multiplying the sum of its prepaid assessment rate as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, plus .75 basis points (which implements the 3 basis point increase in annual assessment rates adopted by the Board on September 29, 2009), times the corresponding prepaid assessment base for each quarter determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prepaid assessment rate.</E> For each quarter of the prepayment period, an institution's prepaid assessment rate shall equal the total base assessment rate that the institution would have paid for the third quarter of 2009 had the institution's CAMELS ratings in effect on September 30, 2009, and, where applicable, long-term debt issuer ratings in effect on September 30, 2009, been in effect for the entire third quarter of 2009.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Prepaid assessment base.</E> For each quarter of the prepayment period, an institution's prepaid assessment base shall be calculated by increasing its third quarter 2009 assessment base at an annual rate of 5 percent.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Finality of prepaid assessment.</E> The prepaid assessment rate and prepaid assessment base defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section shall be determined based upon data in the FDIC's computer systems as of December 24, 2009. Changes to data underlying an institution's adjusted total base assessment rate or assessment base, whether by amendment to a report of condition or otherwise, received by the FDIC after December 24, 2009, shall not affect an institution's prepaid assessment.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Prepaid assessment rates for mergers and consolidations.</E> For mergers and consolidations recorded in the FDIC's computer systems no later than December 24, 2009, the acquired institution's prepaid assessment rate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the prepaid assessment rate of the acquiring institution.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Invoicing of prepaid assessment.</E> The FDIC shall advise each insured depository institution of the amount and calculation of its prepaid assessment at the same time the FDIC provides the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the third quarter of 2009. The FDIC will re-invoice through FDICconnect based upon any data changes as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of prepaid assessment.</E> Each insured depository institution shall pay to the Corporation the amount of its prepaid assessment as required under paragraph (a) of this section in compliance with and subject to the provisions of §§ 327.3 and 327.7 of subpart A.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exception to ACH payment.</E> If an institution's prepaid assessment is greater than $99 million, the institution shall make payment by wire transfer to the FDIC, rather than by funding its designated deposit account for payment via ACH as provided in § 327.3 of subpart A.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">One-time assessment credits.</E> The FDIC will not apply an institution's one-time assessment credit under subpart B of this part 327 to reduce an institution's prepaid assessment. The FDIC will apply an institution's remaining one-time assessment credits under Part 327 subpart B to its quarterly deposit insurance assessments before applying its prepaid assessments.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of prepaid assessments.</E> Prepaid assessments shall only be used to offset regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments payable under this subpart A. The FDIC will begin offsetting regular quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments against prepaid assessments on March 30, 2010. The FDIC will continue to make such offsets until the earlier of the exhaustion of the institution's prepaid assessment or June 30, 2013. Any prepaid assessment remaining after collection of <PRTPAGE P="451"/>the amount due on June 30, 2013, shall be returned to the institution. If the FDIC, in its discretion, determines that its liquidity needs allow, it may return any remaining prepaid assessment to the institution prior to June 30, 2013.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfers.</E> An insured depository institution may enter into an agreement to transfer, but not pledge, any portion of that institution's prepaid assessment to another insured depository institution, provided that the parties to the agreement notify the FDIC's Division of Finance and submit a written agreement, signed by legal representatives of both institutions. The parties must include documentation stating that each representative has the legal authority to bind the institution. The institution transferring its prepaid assessment shall submit the required notice and documentation through FDIC<E T="03">connect.</E> That information will be presented by the FDIC through FDIC<E T="03">connect</E> to the institution acquiring the prepaid assessments for its acceptance. The adjustment to the amount of the prepaid assessment for each institution involved in the transfer will be made in the next assessment invoice that is sent at least 10 days after the FDIC's receipt of acceptance by the institution acquiring the prepaid assessments.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Prepaid assessments following a merger.</E> In the event that an insured depository institution merges with, or consolidates into, another insured depository institution, the surviving or resulting institution will be entitled to use any unused portion of the acquired institution's prepaid assessment not otherwise transferred pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Disposition in the event of failure or termination of insured status.</E> In the event of failure of an insured depository institution, any amount of its prepaid assessment remaining (other than any amounts needed to satisfy its assessment obligations not yet offset against the prepaid amount) will be refunded to the institution's receiver. In the event that an insured depository institution's insured status terminates, any amount of its prepaid assessment remaining (other than any amounts needed to satisfy its assessment obligations not yet offset against the prepaid amount) will be refunded to the institution, subject to the provisions of § 327.6 of subpart A.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Exemptions—</E>(1) <E T="03">Exemption without application.</E> The FDIC, after consultation with an institution's primary federal regulator, will exercise its discretion as supervisor and insurer to exempt an institution from the prepayment requirement under paragraph (a) of this section if the FDIC determines that the prepayment would adversely affect the safety and soundness of that institution. No application is required for this review and the FDIC will notify any affected institution of its exemption by November 23, 2009.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for exemption.</E> An institution may also apply to the FDIC for an exemption from the prepayment requirement under paragraph (a) of this section if the prepayment would significantly impair the institution's liquidity, or would otherwise create extraordinary hardship. Written applications for exemption from the prepayment obligation must be submitted to the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection on or before December 1, 2009, by electronic mail (<E T="03">prepaidassessment@fdic.gov</E>) or fax (202-898-6676). The application must contain a full explanation of the need for the exemption and provide supporting documentation, including current financial statements, cash flow projections, and any other relevant information, including any information the FDIC may request. The FDIC will exercise its discretion in deciding whether to exempt an institution that files an application for exemption. An application shall be deemed denied unless the FDIC notifies an applying institution by December 15, 2009, either that the institution is exempt from the prepaid assessment or the FDIC has postponed determination under paragraph (i)(4) of this section. The FDIC's denial of applications for exemption will be final and not subject to further agency review.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Application for withdrawal of exemption.</E> An institution that has received an exemption under paragraph (i)(1) of this section may request that the FDIC withdraw the exemption. Written applications for withdrawal of <PRTPAGE P="452"/>exemption must be submitted to the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection on or before December 1, 2009, by electronic mail (<E T="03">prepaidassessment@fdic.gov</E>) or fax (202-898-6676). The application must contain a full explanation of the reasons the exemption is not needed and provide supporting documentation, including current financial statements, cash flow projections, and any other relevant information, including any information the FDIC may request. The FDIC, after consultation with the institution's primary Federal regulator, will exercise its discretion in deciding whether to withdraw the exemption. The FDIC will notify an institution of its decision to withdraw the exemption by December 15, 2009; that determination will be final and not subject to further agency review. An application shall be deemed denied unless the FDIC notifies an applying institution by December 15, 2009, that the exemption is withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Postponement of determination.</E> The FDIC may postpone making a determination on any application for exemption filed under paragraph (i)(2) of this section until no later than January 14, 2010. An institution notified by the FDIC of such postponement will not have to pay the prepaid assessment calculated under paragraph (b) of this section on December 30, 2009. If the FDIC denies the application for exemption, the FDIC will notify the institution of the denial and of the date by which the institution must pay the prepaid assessment. The due date for payment of the prepaid assessment after such a denial will be no less than 15 days after the date of the notice of denial.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Obligation to pay third quarter 2009 assessment.</E> Any institution exempted from the prepayment requirement or any institution whose application for exemption has been postponed under this section shall pay to the Corporation on December 30, 2009, any amount due for the third quarter of 2009 as shown on the certified statement invoice for that quarter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Emergency special assessment imposed on June 30, 2009.</E> On June 30, 2009, the FDIC shall impose an emergency special assessment of 20 basis points on each insured depository institution based on the institution's assessment base calculated pursuant to § 327.5 for the second assessment period of 2009.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency special assessments after June 30, 2009.</E> After June 30, 2009, if the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund is estimated to fall to a level that that the Board believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level which shall be close to zero or negative at the end of a calendar quarter, an emergency special assessment of up to 10 basis points may be imposed by a vote of the Board on all insured depository institutions based on each institution's assessment base calculated pursuant to § 327.5 for the corresponding assessment period.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Estimation process.</E> For purposes of any emergency special assessment under this paragraph (b), the FDIC shall estimate the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund for the applicable calendar quarter end from available data on, or estimates of, insurance fund assessment income, investment income, operating expenses, other revenue and expenses, and loss provisions, including provisions for anticipated failures. The FDIC will assume that estimated insured deposits will increase during the quarter at the average quarterly rate over the previous four quarters.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Imposition and announcement of emergency special assessments.</E> Any emergency special assessment under this paragraph (b) shall be on the last day of a calendar quarter and shall be announced by the end of such quarter. As soon as practicable after announcement, the FDIC will have a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the emergency special assessment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Invoicing of any emergency special assessments.</E> The FDIC shall advise each insured depository institution of the amount and calculation of any emergency special assessment imposed <PRTPAGE P="453"/>under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. This information shall be provided at the same time as the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the assessment period in which the emergency special assessment was imposed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of any emergency special assessment.</E> Each insured depository institution shall pay to the Corporation any emergency special assessment imposed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section in compliance with and subject to the provisions of §§ 327.3, 327.6 and 327.7 of subpart A, and the provisions of subpart B. The payment date for any emergency special assessment shall be the date provided in § 327.3(b)(2) for the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the calendar quarter in which the emergency special assessment was imposed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assessment pricing methods—beginning the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, where the reserve ratio of the DIF as of the end of the prior assessment period has reached or exceeded 1.15 percent.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Established small institutions.</E> Beginning the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, where the reserve ratio of the DIF as of the end of the prior assessment period has reached or exceeded 1.15 percent, and for all subsequent assessment periods, an established small institution shall have its initial base assessment rate determined by using the financial ratios methods set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Under the financial ratios method, each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount. The resulting sum shall equal the institution's initial base assessment rate; provided, however, that no institution's initial base assessment rate shall be less than the minimum initial base assessment rate in effect for established small institutions with a particular CAMELS composite rating for that assessment period nor greater than the maximum initial base assessment rate in effect for established small institutions with a particular CAMELS composite rating for that assessment period. An institution's initial base assessment rate, subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, as appropriate (resulting in the institution's total base assessment rate, which in no case can be lower than 50 percent of the institution's initial base assessment rate), and adjusted for the actual assessment rates set by the Board under § 327.10(f), will equal an institution's assessment rate. The seven financial ratios are: Leverage Ratio (%); Net Income before Taxes/Total Assets (%); Nonperforming Loans and Leases/Gross Assets (%); Other Real Estate Owned/Gross Assets (%); Brokered Deposit Ratio (%); One Year Asset Growth (%); and Loan Mix Index. The ratios and the weighted average of CAMELS component ratings are defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The ratios will be determined for an assessment period based upon information contained in an institution's report of condition filed as of the last day of the assessment period as set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The weighted average of CAMELS component ratings is created by multiplying each component by the following percentages and adding the products: Capital adequacy—25%, Asset quality—20%, Management—25%, Earnings—10%, Liquidity—10%, and Sensitivity to market risk—10%. The following tables set forth the values of the pricing multipliers:</P>

The Loan Mix Index is calculated by multiplying the ratio of an institution's amount of loans in a particular loan category to its total assets by the associated weighted average charge-off rate for that loan category, and summing the products for all loan categories. The table gives the weighted average charge-off rate for each category of loan. The Loan Mix Index excludes credit card loans.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) A weighted average CAMELS rating converts to a score that ranges from 25 to 100. A weighted average rating of 1 equals a score of 25 and a weighted average of 3.5 or greater equals a score of 100. Weighted average CAMELS ratings between 1 and 3.5 are assigned a score between 25 and 100. The score increases at an increasing rate as the weighted average CAMELS rating increases. Appendix B of this subpart describes the conversion of a weighted average CAMELS rating to a score.</P>

Appendix A of this subpart describes these measures.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The Leverage ratio and the ratio of core earnings to average quarter-end total assets are described in appendix A of this subpart and the method of calculating the scores is described in appendix B of this subpart.</P>

Each ratio is described in appendix A of this subpart. The method used to convert the concentration measure into a score is described in appendix C of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) The credit quality score is the greater of the criticized and classified items to Tier 1 capital and reserves score or the underperforming assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves score.

All of these ratios are described in appendix A of this subpart and the method of calculating the scores is described in appendix B of this subpart. Each score is multiplied by its respective weight, and the resulting weighted score is summed to compute the score for the market risk measure. An overall weight of 35 percent is allocated between the scores for the credit quality measure and market risk measure.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjustment to total score for large institutions and highly complex institutions.</E> The total score for large institutions and highly complex institutions is subject to adjustment, up or down, by a maximum of 15 points, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the appropriate scorecard. In making such adjustments, the FDIC may consider such information as financial performance and condition information and other market or supervisory information. The FDIC will also consult with an institution's primary federal regulator and, for state chartered institutions, state banking supervisor.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Prior notice of adjustments</E>—(A) <E T="03">Prior notice of upward adjustment.</E> Prior to making any upward adjustment to an institution's total score because of considerations of additional risk information, the FDIC will formally notify the institution and its primary federal regulator and provide an opportunity to respond. This notification will include the reasons for the adjustment and when the adjustment will take effect.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Prior notice of downward adjustment.</E> Prior to making any downward adjustment to an institution's total score because of considerations of additional risk information, the FDIC will formally notify the institution's primary federal regulator and provide an opportunity to respond.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Determination whether to adjust upward; effective period of adjustment.</E> After considering an institution's and the primary federal regulator's responses to the notice, the FDIC will determine whether the adjustment to an institution's total score is warranted, taking into account any revisions to scorecard measures, as well as any actions taken by the institution to address the FDIC's concerns described in the notice. The FDIC will evaluate the need for the adjustment each subsequent assessment period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the amount of adjustment cannot exceed the proposed adjustment amount contained in the initial notice unless additional notice is provided so that the primary federal regulator and the institution may respond.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Determination whether to adjust downward; effective period of adjustment.</E> After considering the primary federal regulator's responses to the notice, the FDIC will determine whether the adjustment to total score is warranted, taking into account any revisions to scorecard measures. Any downward adjustment in an institution's total score will remain in effect for subsequent assessment periods until the FDIC determines that an adjustment is no longer warranted. Downward adjustments will be made without notification to the institution. However, the FDIC will provide advance notice to an institution and its primary federal regulator and give them an opportunity to respond before removing a downward adjustment.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Adjustment without notice.</E> Notwithstanding the notice provisions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the FDIC may change an institution's total score without advance notice, if the institution's supervisory ratings or the scorecard measures deteriorate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">New small institutions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Risk categories.</E> Each new small institution shall be assigned to one of the following four Risk Categories based upon the institution's capital evaluation and supervisory evaluation as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Risk category I.</E> New small institutions in Supervisory Group A that are Well Capitalized will be assigned to Risk Category I.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Risk category II.</E> New small institutions in Supervisory Group A that are Adequately Capitalized, and new <PRTPAGE P="463"/>small institutions in Supervisory Group B that are either Well Capitalized or Adequately Capitalized will be assigned to Risk Category II.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Risk category III.</E> New small institutions in Supervisory Groups A and B that are Undercapitalized, and new small institutions in Supervisory Group C that are Well Capitalized or Adequately Capitalized will be assigned to Risk Category III.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Risk category IV.</E> New small institutions in Supervisory Group C that are Undercapitalized will be assigned to Risk Category IV.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Capital evaluations.</E> Each new small institution will receive one of the following three capital evaluations on the basis of data reported in the institution's Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Report (or successor report, as appropriate) dated as of the last day of each assessment period: Well Capitalized, Adequately Capitalized, or Undercapitalized as defined in § 327.8(z) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Supervisory evaluations.</E> Each new small institution will be assigned to one of three Supervisory Groups based on the Corporation's consideration of supervisory evaluations provided by the institution's primary federal regulator. The supervisory evaluations include the results of examination findings by the primary federal regulator, as well as other information that the primary federal regulator determines to be relevant. In addition, the Corporation will take into consideration such other information (such as state examination findings, as appropriate) as it determines to be relevant to the institution's financial condition and the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The three Supervisory Groups are:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Supervisory group “A.”</E> This Supervisory Group consists of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Supervisory group “B.”</E> This Supervisory Group consists of institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which, if not corrected, could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund; and</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Supervisory group “C.”</E> This Supervisory Group consists of institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund unless effective corrective action is taken.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Assessment method for new small institutions in risk category I</E>—(i) <E T="03">Maximum initial base assessment rate for risk category I new small institutions.</E> A new small institution in Risk Category I shall be assessed the maximum initial base assessment rate for Risk Category I small institutions in the relevant assessment period.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">New small institutions not subject to certain adjustments.</E> No new small institution in any risk category shall be subject to the adjustment in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Implementation of CAMELS rating changes</E>—(A) <E T="03">Changes between risk categories.</E> If, during an assessment period, a CAMELS composite rating change occurs that results in a Risk Category I institution moving from Risk Category I to Risk Category II, III or IV, the institution's initial base assessment rate for the portion of the assessment period that it was in Risk Category I shall be the maximum initial base assessment rate for the relevant assessment period, subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, as appropriate, and adjusted for the actual assessment rates set by the Board under § 327.10(f). For the portion of the assessment period that the institution was not in Risk Category I, the institution's initial base assessment rate, which shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, as appropriate, shall be determined under the assessment schedule for the appropriate Risk Category. If, during an assessment period, a CAMELS composite rating change occurs that results in an institution moving from Risk Category II, III or IV to Risk Category I, then the maximum initial base assessment rate for new small institutions in Risk Category I shall apply for the portion of the assessment period that it was in Risk Category I, subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, as appropriate, and adjusted for the actual assessment rates set by the Board under § 327.10(f). <PRTPAGE P="464"/>For the portion of the assessment period that the institution was not in Risk Category I, the institution's initial base assessment rate, which shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section shall be determined under the assessment schedule for the appropriate Risk Category.</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Insured branches of foreign banks</E>—(1) <E T="03">Risk categories for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> Insured branches of foreign banks shall be assigned to risk categories as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Capital evaluations for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> Each insured branch of a foreign bank will receive one of the following three capital evaluations on the basis of data reported in the institution's Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks dated as of March 31 for the assessment period beginning the preceding January 1; dated as of June 30 for the assessment period beginning the preceding April 1; dated as of September 30 for the assessment period beginning the preceding July 1; and dated as of December 31 for the assessment period beginning the preceding October 1.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Well Capitalized.</E> An insured branch of a foreign bank is Well Capitalized if the insured branch:</P>
              <P>(A) Maintains the pledge of assets required under § 347.209 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(B) Maintains the eligible assets prescribed under § 347.210 of this chapter at 108 percent or more of the average book value of the insured branch's third-party liabilities for the quarter ending on the report date specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adequately Capitalized.</E> An insured branch of a foreign bank is Adequately Capitalized if the insured branch:</P>
              <P>(A) Maintains the pledge of assets required under § 347.209 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(B) Maintains the eligible assets prescribed under § 347.210 of this chapter at 106 percent or more of the average book value of the insured branch's third-party liabilities for the quarter ending on the report date specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(C) Does not meet the definition of a Well Capitalized insured branch of a foreign bank.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Undercapitalized.</E> An insured branch of a foreign bank is undercapitalized institution if it does not qualify as either Well Capitalized or Adequately Capitalized under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Supervisory evaluations for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> Each insured branch of a foreign bank will be assigned to one of three supervisory groups as set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Assessment method for insured branches of foreign banks in risk category I.</E> Insured branches of foreign banks in Risk Category I shall be assessed using the weighted average ROCA component rating.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Weighted average ROCA component rating.</E> The weighted average ROCA component rating shall equal the sum of the products that result from multiplying ROCA component ratings by the following percentages: Risk Management—35%, Operational Controls—25%, Compliance—25%, and Asset Quality—15%. The weighted average ROCA rating will be multiplied by 5.076 (which shall be the pricing multiplier). To this result will be added a uniform amount. The resulting sum—the initial base assessment rate—will equal an institution's total base assessment rate; provided, however, that no institution's total base assessment rate will be less than the minimum total base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that assessment period nor greater than the maximum total base assessment rate in effect for Risk Category I institutions for that assessment period.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Uniform amount.</E> Except as adjusted for the actual assessment rates set by the Board under § 327.10(f), the uniform amount for all insured branches of foreign banks shall be:</P>
              <P>(A) −5.127 whenever the assessment rate schedule set forth in § 327.10(b) is in effect;</P>
              <P>(B) −6.127 whenever the assessment rate schedule set forth in § 327.10(c) is in effect; or</P>

              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Insured branches of foreign banks not subject to certain adjustments.</E> No insured branch of a foreign bank in any risk category shall be subject to the adjustments in paragraph (b)(3) or (e)(1) or (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Implementation of changes between risk categories for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> If, during an assessment period, a ROCA rating change occurs that results in an insured branch of a foreign bank moving from Risk Category I to Risk Category II, III or IV, the institution's initial base assessment rate for the portion of the assessment period that it was in Risk Category I shall be determined using the weighted average ROCA component rating. For the portion of the assessment period that the institution was not in Risk Category I, the institution's initial base assessment rate shall be determined under the assessment schedule for the appropriate Risk Category. If, during an assessment period, a ROCA rating change occurs that results in an insured branch of a foreign bank moving from Risk Category II, III or IV to Risk Category I, the institution's assessment rate for the portion of the assessment period that it was in Risk Category I shall equal the rate determined as provided using the weighted average ROCA component rating. For the portion of the assessment period that the institution was not in Risk Category I, the institution's initial base assessment rate shall be determined under the assessment schedule for the appropriate Risk Category.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Implementation of changes within risk category I for insured branches of foreign banks.</E> If, during an assessment period, an insured branch of a foreign bank remains in Risk Category I, but a ROCA component rating changes that will affect the institution's initial base assessment rate, separate assessment rates for the portion(s) of the assessment period before and after the change(s) shall be determined under this paragraph (d)(4).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Adjustments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Unsecured debt adjustment to initial base assessment rate for all institutions.</E> All institutions, except new institutions as provided under paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section and insured branches of foreign banks as provided under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, shall be subject to an adjustment of assessment rates for unsecured debt. Any unsecured debt adjustment shall be made after any adjustment under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of unsecured debt adjustment.</E> The unsecured debt adjustment shall be determined as the sum of the initial base assessment rate plus 40 basis points; that sum shall be multiplied by the ratio of an insured depository institution's long-term unsecured debt to its assessment base. The amount of the reduction in the assessment rate due to the adjustment is equal to the dollar amount of the adjustment divided by the amount of the assessment base.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> No unsecured debt adjustment for any institution shall exceed the lesser of 5 basis points or 50 percent of the institution's initial base assessment rate.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Applicable quarterly reports of condition.</E> Unsecured debt adjustment ratios for any given quarter shall be calculated from quarterly reports of condition (Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income and Thrift Financial Reports, or any successor reports to either, as appropriate) filed by each institution as of the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Depository institution debt adjustment to initial base assessment rate for all institutions.</E> All institutions shall be subject to an adjustment of assessment rates for unsecured debt held that is issued by another depository institution. Any such depository institution debt adjustment shall be made after any adjustment under paragraphs (b)(3) and (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of depository institution debt adjustment.</E> An insured depository institution shall pay a 50 basis point adjustment on the amount of unsecured debt it holds that was issued by another insured depository institution to the extent that such debt exceeds 3 percent of the institution's Tier 1 capital. The amount of long-term unsecured debt issued by another insured depository institution shall be calculated using the same valuation methodology used to calculate the amount of such debt for reporting on the asset side of the balance sheets.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Applicable quarterly reports of condition.</E> Depository institution debt adjustment ratios for any given quarter shall be calculated from quarterly reports of condition (Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income and Thrift Financial Reports, or any successor reports to either, as appropriate) filed by each institution as of the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Brokered deposit adjustment.</E> All new small institutions in Risk Categories II, III, and IV, all large institutions and all highly complex institutions, except large and highly complex institutions (including new large and new highly complex institutions) that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, shall be subject to an assessment rate adjustment for brokered deposits. Any such brokered deposit adjustment shall be made after any adjustment under paragraphs (b)(3) and (e)(1) and (2) of this section. The brokered deposit adjustment includes all brokered deposits as defined in Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831f), and 12 CFR 337.6, including brokered reciprocal deposits as defined in § 327.8(q), and brokered deposits that consist of balances swept into an insured institution from another institution. The adjustment under this paragraph is limited to those institutions whose ratio of brokered deposits to domestic deposits is greater than 10 percent; asset growth rates do not affect the adjustment. Insured branches of foreign banks are not subject to the brokered deposit adjustment as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Application of brokered deposit adjustment.</E> The brokered deposit adjustment shall be determined by multiplying 25 basis points by the ratio of the difference between an insured depository institution's brokered deposits and 10 percent of its domestic deposits to its assessment base.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> The maximum brokered deposit adjustment will be 10 basis points; the minimum brokered deposit adjustment will be 0.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Applicable quarterly reports of condition.</E> The brokered deposit adjustment for any given quarter shall be calculated from the quarterly reports of condition (Call Reports and Thrift Financial Reports, or any successor reports to either, as appropriate) filed by each institution as of the last day of the quarter.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Request to be treated as a large institution</E>—(1) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Any institution with assets of between $5 billion and $10 billion may request that the FDIC determine its assessment rate as a large institution. The FDIC will consider such a request provided that it has sufficient information to do so. Any such request must be made to the FDIC's Division of Insurance and Research. Any approved change will become effective within one year from the date of the request. If an institution whose request has been granted subsequently reports assets of less than $5 billion in its report of condition for four consecutive quarters, the institution shall be deemed a small institution for assessment purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time limit on subsequent request for alternate method.</E> An institution whose request to be assessed as a large institution is granted by the FDIC shall not be eligible to request that it be assessed as a small institution for a period of three years from the first quarter in which its approved request to be assessed as a large institution became effective. Any request to be assessed as a small institution must be made to the FDIC's Division of Insurance and Research.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> An institution that disagrees with the FDIC's determination that it is a large, highly complex, or small institution may request review of that determination pursuant to § 327.4(c).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">New and established institutions and exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">New small institutions.</E> A new small Risk Category I institution shall be assessed the Risk Category I maximum initial base assessment rate for the relevant assessment period. No new small institution in any risk category shall be subject to the unsecured debt adjustment as determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. All new small institutions in any Risk Category shall be subject to the depository institution debt adjustment as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. All new small institutions in Risk Categories II, III, <PRTPAGE P="467"/>and IV shall be subject to the brokered deposit adjustment as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">New large institutions and new highly complex institutions.</E> All new large institutions and all new highly complex institutions shall be assessed under the appropriate method provided at paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section and subject to the adjustments provided at paragraphs (b)(3) and (e)(2) and (3) of this section. No new highly complex or large institutions are entitled to adjustment under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If a large or highly complex institution has not yet received CAMELS ratings, it will be given a weighted CAMELS rating of 2 for assessment purposes until actual CAMELS ratings are assigned.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">CAMELS ratings for the surviving institution in a merger or consolidation.</E> When an established institution merges with or consolidates into a new institution, if the FDIC determines the resulting institution to be an established institution under § 327.8(k)(1), its CAMELS ratings for assessment purposes will be based upon the established institution's ratings prior to the merger or consolidation until new ratings become available.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Rate applicable to institutions subject to subsidiary or credit union exception</E>—(i) <E T="03">Established small institutions.</E> A small institution that is established under § 327.8(k)(4) or (5) shall be assessed as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) If the institution does not have a CAMELS composite rating, its initial base assessment rate shall be 2 basis points above the minimum initial base assessment rate applicable to established small institutions until it receives a CAMELS composite rating.</P>
              <P>(B) If the institution has a CAMELS composite rating but no CAMELS component ratings, its initial assessment rate shall be determined using the financial ratios method, as set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but its CAMELS composite rating will be substituted for its weighted average CAMELS component rating and, if the institution has not filed four quarterly reports of condition, then the assessment rate will be determined by annualizing, where appropriate, financial ratios from all quarterly reports of condition that have been filed.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Large or highly complex institutions.</E> If a large or highly complex institution is considered established under § 327.8(k)(4) or (5), but does not have CAMELS component ratings, it will be given a weighted CAMELS rating of 2 for assessment purposes until actual CAMELS ratings are assigned.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> An institution that disagrees with the FDIC's determination that it is a new institution may request review of that determination pursuant to § 327.4(c).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Assessment rates for bridge depository institutions and conservatorships.</E> Institutions that are bridge depository institutions under 12 U.S.C. 1821(n) and institutions for which the Corporation has been appointed or serves as conservator shall, in all cases, be assessed at the minimum initial base assessment rate applicable to established small institutions, which shall not be subject to adjustment under paragraph (b)(3) or (e)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.</P>

The asset growth rate factor (A<E T="52">i,T</E>) is calculated by subtracting 0.4 from the four-year cumulative gross asset growth rate (expressed as a number rather than as a percentage), adjusted for mergers and acquisitions, and multiplying the remainder by 3<FR>1/3</FR>.

              <P>The component rating for sensitivity to market risk (the “S” rating) is not available for years prior to 1997. As a result, and as described in Table A.1, the Statistical Model is estimated using a weighted average of five component ratings excluding the “S” component. Delinquency and non-accrual data on government guaranteed loans are not available before 1993 for Call Report filers and before the third quarter of 2005 for TFR filers. As a result, and as also described in Table A.1, the Statistical Model is estimated without deducting delinquent or past-due government guaranteed loans from either the loans past due 30-89 days to gross assets ratio or the nonperforming assets to gross assets ratio. Reciprocal deposits are not presently reported in the Call Report or TFR. As a result, and as also described in Table A.1, the Statistical Model is estimated without deducting reciprocal deposits from brokered deposits in determining the adjusted brokered deposit ratio.</P>

Counterparty exposure excludes all counterparty exposure to the U.S. government and departments or agencies of the U.S. government that is unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

The total exposure amount is equal to the sum of the institution's exposure amounts to one counterparty (or borrower) for derivatives, SFTs, and cleared transactions, and its gross lending exposure (including all unfunded commitments) to that counterparty (or borrower). A counterparty includes an entity's own affiliates. Exposures to entities that are affiliates of each other are treated as exposures to one counterparty (or borrower).

Total debt excludes pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and preferred equity.</P>
              <P>Senior debt includes any portion of total debt that has a priority claim on any of the borrower's assets. A priority claim is a claim that entitles the holder to priority of payment over other debt holders in bankruptcy.</P>

If the loan is made to a subsidiary of a larger organization, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio may be calculated using the financial statements of the subsidiary or, if the parent company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the borrower's debt, using the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.</P>
              <P>In the case of a merger of two companies or the acquisition of one or more companies or parts of companies, pro-forma debt is to be used as well as the trailing twelve-month pro-forma EBITDA for the combined companies.

              <P>Asset-based loans (loans secured by accounts receivable and inventory) that meet all the following conditions are excluded from a bank's higher-risk C&amp;I loan totals:</P>
              <P>(a) The loan is managed by a loan officer or group of loan officers at the reporting bank who have experience in asset-based lending and collateral monitoring, including, but not limited to, experience in reviewing the following: Collateral reports, borrowing base certificates (which are discussed herein), collateral audit reports, loan-to-collateral values (LTV), and loan limits, using procedures common to the industry.</P>
              <P>(b) The bank has taken, or has the legally enforceable ability to take, dominion over the borrower's deposit accounts such that proceeds of collateral are applied to the loan balance as collected. Security agreements must be in place in all cases; in addition, if a borrower's deposit account is held at a bank other than the lending bank, an account control agreement must also be in place.</P>
              <P>(c) The bank has a perfected first priority security interest in all assets included in the borrowing base certificate.</P>
              <P>(d) If the loan is a credit facility (revolving or term loan), it must be fully secured by self-liquidating assets such as accounts receivable and inventory.<SU>7</SU>
                <FTREF/> Other non-self-liquidating assets may be part of the borrowing base, but the outstanding balance of the loan must be fully secured by the portion of the borrowing base that is composed of self-liquidating assets. Fully secured is defined as a 100 percent or lower LTV ratio after applying the appropriate discounts (determined by the loan agreement) to the collateral. If an over advance (including a seasonal over advance) causes the LTV to exceed 100 percent, the loan may not be excluded from higher-risk C&amp;I loans owed by a higher-risk C&amp;I borrower. Additionally, the bank must have the ability to withhold funding of a draw or advance if the loan amount exceeds the amount allowed by the collateral formula.</P>

                <P>
                  <SU>7</SU> An asset is self-liquidating if, in the event the borrower defaults, the asset can be easily liquidated and the proceeds of the sale of the assets would be used to pay down the loan. These assets can include machinery, heavy equipment or rental equipment if the machinery or equipment is inventory for the borrower's primary business and the machinery or equipment is included in the borrowing base.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(e) A bank's lending policy or procedures must address the maintenance of an accounts receivable loan agreement with the borrower. This loan agreement must establish a maximum percentage advance, which cannot exceed 85 percent, against eligible accounts receivable, include a maximum dollar amount due from any one account debtor, address the financial strength of debtor accounts, and define eligible receivables. The definition of eligible receivables must consider the receivable quality, the turnover and dilution rates of receivables pledged, the aging of accounts receivable, the concentrations of debtor accounts, and the performance of the receivables related to their terms of sale.</P>
              <P>Concentration of debtor accounts is the percentage value of receivables associated with one or a few customers relative to the total value of receivables. Turnover of receivables is the velocity at which receivables are collected. The dilution rate is the uncollectible accounts receivable as a percentage of sales.</P>
              <P>Ineligibles must be established for any debtor account where there is concern that the debtor may not pay according to terms. Monthly accounts receivable agings must be received in sufficient detail to allow the bank to compute the required ineligibles. At a minimum, the following items must be deemed ineligible accounts receivable:</P>
              <P>(i) Accounts receivable balances over 90 days beyond invoice date or 60 days past due, depending upon custom with respect to a particular industry with appropriate adjustments made for dated billings;</P>
              <P>(ii) Entire account balances where over 50 percent of the account is over 60 days past due or 90 days past invoice date;</P>

              <P>(iii) Accounts arising from sources other than trade (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> royalties, rebates);</P>
              <P>(iv) Consignment or guaranteed sales;</P>
              <P>(v) Notes receivable;</P>
              <P>(vi) Progress billings;</P>
              <P>(vii) Account balances in excess of limits appropriate to account debtor's credit worthiness or unduly concentrated by industry, location or customer;</P>
              <P>(viii) Affiliate and intercompany accounts; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Foreign accounts receivable.</P>

              <P>(f) Loans against inventory must be made with advance rates no more than 65 percent of eligible inventory (at the lower of cost valued on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis or market) based on an analysis of realizable value. When an appraisal is obtained, or there is a readily determinable market price for the inventory, however, up to 85 percent of the net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) or the market price of the inventory may be financed. Inventory must be valued or appraised by an independent third-party appraiser using NOLV, fair value, or forced sale value (versus a “going concern” value), whichever is appropriate, to arrive at a net realizable value. Appraisals are to be prepared in accordance with industry standards, unless there is a readily available and determinable market price for the inventory (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in the case of various commodities), from a recognized exchange or third-party industry <PRTPAGE P="478"/>source, and a readily available market (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for aluminum, crude oil, steel, and other traded commodities); in that case, inventory may be valued using current market value. When relying upon current market value rather than an independent appraisal, the reporting bank's management must update the value of inventory as market prices for the product change. Valuation updates must be as frequent as needed to ensure compliance with margin requirements. In addition, appropriate mark-to-market reserves must be established to protect against excessive inventory price fluctuations. An asset has a readily identifiable and publicly available market price if the asset's price is quoted routinely in a widely disseminated publication that is readily available to the general public.</P>
              <P>(g) A bank's lending policy or procedures must address the maintenance of an inventory loan agreement with the borrower. This loan agreement must establish a maximum percentage advance rate against acceptable inventory, address acceptable appraisal and valuation requirements, and define acceptable and ineligible inventory. Ineligibles must be established for inventory that exhibit characteristics that make it difficult to achieve a realizable value or to obtain possession of the inventory. Monthly inventory agings must be received in sufficient detail to allow the bank to compute the required ineligibles. At a minimum, ineligible inventory must include:</P>
              <P>(i) Slow moving, obsolete inventory and items turning materially slower than industry average;</P>
              <P>(ii) Inventory with value to the client only, which is generally work in process, but may include raw materials used solely in the client's manufacturing process;</P>
              <P>(iii) Consigned inventory or other inventory where a perfected security interest cannot be obtained;</P>
              <P>(iv) Off-premise inventory subject to a mechanic's or other lien; and</P>
              <P>(v) Specialized, high technology or other inventory subject to rapid obsolescence or valuation problems.</P>
              <P>(h) The bank must maintain documentation of borrowing base certificate reviews and collateral trend analyses to demonstrate that collateral values are actively, routinely and consistently monitored. A borrowing base certificate is a form prepared by the borrower that reflects the current status of the collateral. A new borrowing base certificate must be obtained within 30 days before or after each draw or advance on a loan. A bank is required to validate the borrowing base through asset-based tracking reports. The borrowing base validation process must include the bank requesting from the borrower a list of accounts receivable by creditor and a list of individual items of inventory and the bank certifying that the outstanding balance of the loan remains within the collateral formula prescribed by the loan agreement. Any discrepancies between the list of accounts receivable and inventory and the borrowing base certificate must be reconciled with the borrower. Periodic, but no less than annual, field examinations (audits) must also be performed by individuals who are independent of the credit origination or administration process. There must be a process in place to ensure that the bank is correcting audit exceptions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Floor Plan Lending Conditions</HD>
              <P>Floor plan loans may include, but are not limited to, loans to finance the purchase of various vehicles or equipment including automobiles, boat or marine equipment, recreational vehicles (RV), motorized watersports vehicles such as jet skis, or motorized lawn and garden equipment such as tractor lawnmowers. Floor plan loans that meet all the following conditions are excluded from a bank's higher-risk C&amp;I loan totals:</P>

              <P>(a) The loan is managed by a loan officer or a group of loan officers at the reporting bank who are experienced in floor plan lending and monitoring collateral to ensure the borrower remains in compliance with floor plan limits and repayment requirements. Loan officers must have experience in reviewing certain items, including but not limited to: Collateral reports, floor plan limits, floor plan aging reports, vehicle inventory audits or inspections, and LTV ratios. The bank must obtain and review financial statements of the borrower (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> tax returns, company-prepared financial statements, or dealer statements) on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that adequate controls are in place. (A “dealer statement” is the standard format financial statement issued by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and used by nationally recognized automobile dealer floor plan lenders.)</P>

              <P>(b) For automobile floor plans, each loan advance must be made against a specific automobile under a borrowing base certificate held as collateral at no more than 100 percent of (i) dealer invoice plus freight charges (for new vehicles) or (ii) the cost of a used automobile at auction or the wholesale value using the prevailing market guide (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> NADA, Black Book, Blue Book). The advance rate of 100 percent of dealer invoice plus freight charges on new automobiles, and the advance rate of the cost of a used automobile at auction or the wholesale value, may only be used where there is a manufacturer repurchase agreement or an aggressive curtailment program in place that is tracked by the bank over time and subject to strong controls. Otherwise, permissible advance rates must be lower than 100 percent.</P>

              <P>(c) Advance rates on vehicles other than automobiles must conform to industry <PRTPAGE P="479"/>standards for advance rates on such inventory, but may never exceed 100 percent of dealer invoice plus freight charges on new vehicles or 100 percent of the cost of a used vehicle at auction or its wholesale value.</P>
              <P>(d) Each loan is self-liquidating (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> if the borrower defaulted on the loan, the collateral could be easily liquidated and the proceeds of the sale of the collateral would be used to pay down the loan advance).</P>
              <P>(e) Vehicle inventories and collateral values are closely monitored, including the completion of regular (at least quarterly) dealership automotive or other vehicle dealer inventory audits or inspections to ensure accurate accounting for all vehicles held as collateral. The lending bank or a third party must prepare inventory audit reports and inspection reports for loans to automotive dealerships, or loans to other vehicle dealers, and the lending bank must review the reports at least quarterly. The reports must list all vehicles held as collateral and verify that the collateral is in the dealer's possession.</P>

              <P>(f) Floor plan aging reports must be reviewed by the bank as frequently as required under the loan agreement, but no less frequently than quarterly. Floor plan aging reports must reflect specific information about each automobile or vehicle being financed (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the make, model, and color of the automobile or other vehicle, and origination date of the loan to finance the automobile or vehicle). Curtailment programs should be instituted where necessary and banks must ensure that curtailment payments are made on stale automotive or other vehicle inventory financed under the floor plan loan.</P>

If no information is available, then the bank must obtain recent, refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party to determine the PD. Refreshed data is defined as the most recent data available, and must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the loan. In addition, for loans acquired on or after April 1, 2013, the acquiring bank shall have six months from the date of acquisition to determine the PD.</P>
              <P>When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question or in the previous calendar year. If the acquiring bank cannot or does not verify the information provided by the original lender, the acquiring bank must obtain the necessary information from the borrower or other appropriate third party to make its own determination of whether the purchased assets should be classified as a higher-risk consumer loan.</P>

              <P>A loan that meets both the nontraditional mortgage loan and higher-risk consumer loan definitions at the time of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, must be reported only as a nontraditional mortgage loan. If, however, the loan ceases to meet the nontraditional mortgage loan definition but continues to meet the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan, the loan is to be reported as a higher-risk consumer loan.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">General Requirements for PD Estimation</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Scorable Consumer Loans</HD>

              <P>Estimates of the two-year PD for a loan must be based on the observed, stress period default rate (defined herein) for loans of a similar product type made to consumers with credit risk comparable to the borrower being evaluated. While a bank may consider additional risk factors beyond the product type and credit score (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> geography) in estimating the PD of a loan, it must at a minimum account for these two factors. The credit risk assessment must be determined using third party or internal scores derived using a scoring system that qualifies as <E T="03">empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound</E> as defined in 12 CFR 202.2(p), as it may be amended from time to time, and has been approved by the bank's model risk oversight and governance process and internal audit mechanism. In the case of a consumer loan with a co-signer or co-borrower, the PD may be determined using the most favorable individual credit score.</P>
              <P>In estimating the PD based on such scores, banks must adhere to the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(a) The PD must be estimated as the average of the two, 24-month default rates observed from July 2007 to June 2009, and July 2009 to June 2011, where the average is calculated according to the following formula <PRTPAGE P="481"/>and DR<E T="52">t</E> is the observed default rate over the 24-month period beginning in July of year t:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="27" SPAN="2">
                <GID>ER31OC12.028</GID>
              </GPH>

              <P>(b) The default rate for each 24-month period must be calculated as the number of active loans that experienced at least one default event during the period divided by the total number of active loans as of the observation date (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the beginning of the 24-month period). An “active” loan is defined as any loan that was open and not in default as of the observation date, and on which a payment was made within the 12 months prior to the observation date.</P>
              <P>(c) The default rate for each 24-month period must be calculated using a stratified random sample of loans that is sufficient in size to derive statistically meaningful results for the product type and credit score (and any additional risk factors) being evaluated. The product strata must be as homogenous as possible with respect to the factors that influence default, such that products with distinct risk characteristics are evaluated separately. The loans should be sampled based on the credit score as of the observation date, and each 24-month default rate must be calculated using a random sample of at least 1,200 active loans.</P>
              <P>(d) Credit score strata must be determined by partitioning the entire credit score range generated by a given scoring system into a minimum of 15 bands. While the width of the credit score bands may vary, the scores within each band must reflect a comparable level of credit risk. Because performance data for scores at the upper and lower extremes of the population distribution is likely to be limited, however, the top and bottom bands may include a range of scores that suggest some variance in credit quality.</P>
              <P>(e) Each credit score will need to have a unique PD associated with it. Therefore, when the number of score bands is less than the number of unique credit scores (as will almost always be the case), banks must use a linear interpolation between adjacent default rates to determine the PD for a particular score. The observed default rate for each band must be assumed to correspond to the midpoint of the range for the band. For example, if one score band ranges from 621 to 625 and has an observed default rate of 4 percent, while the next lowest band ranges from 616 to 620 and has an observed default rate of 6 percent, a 620 score must be assigned a default rate of 5.2 percent, calculated as</P>
              <GPH DEEP="27" SPAN="2">
                <GID>ER31OC12.029</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>When evaluating scores that fall below the midpoint of the lowest score band or above the midpoint of the highest score band, the interpolation must be based on an assumed adjacent default rate of 1 or 0, respectively.</P>
              <P>(f) The credit scores represented in the historical sample must have been produced by the same entity, using the same or substantially similar methodology as the methodology used to derive the credit scores to which the default rates will be applied. For example, the default rate for a particular vendor score cannot be evaluated based on the score-to-default rate relationship for a different vendor, even if the range of scores under both systems is the same. On the other hand, if the current and historical scores were produced by the same vendor using slightly different versions of the same scoring system and equivalent scores represent a similar likelihood of default, then the historical experience could be applied.</P>
              <P>(g) A loan is to be considered in default when it is 90 + days past due, charged-off, or the borrower enters bankruptcy.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Unscorable Consumer Loans</HD>

              <P>For unscorable consumer loans—where the available information about a borrower is insufficient to determine a credit score—the bank will be unable to assign a PD to the loan according to the requirements described above. If the total outstanding balance of the unscorable consumer loans of a particular product type (including, but not limited to, student loans) exceeds 5 percent of the total outstanding balance for that product type, including both foreign and domestic loans, <PRTPAGE P="482"/>the excess amount shall be treated as higher risk (the de minimis approach). Otherwise, the total outstanding balance of unscorable consumer loans of a particular product type will not be considered higher risk. The consumer product types used to determine whether the 5 percent test is satisfied shall correspond to the product types listed in the table used for reporting PD estimates.</P>
              <P>A bank may not develop PD estimates for unscorable loans based on internal data.</P>
              <P>If, after the origination or refinance of the loan, an unscorable consumer loan becomes scorable, a bank must reclassify the loan using a PD estimated according to the general requirements above. Based upon that PD, the loan will be determined to be either higher risk or not, and that determination will remain in effect until a refinancing occurs, at which time the loan must be re-evaluated. An unscorable loan must be reviewed at least annually to determine if a credit score has become available.</P>

              <P>A bank may use internally derived default rates that were calculated using fewer observations or score bands than those specified above under certain conditions. The bank must submit a written request to the FDIC either in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under the requested approach. The request must explain in detail how the proposed approach differs from the rule specifications and the bank must provide support for the statistical appropriateness of the proposed methodology. The request must include, at a minimum, a table with the default rates and number of observations used in each score and product segment. The FDIC will evaluate the proposed methodology and may request additional information from the bank, which the bank must provide. The bank may report using its proposed approach while the FDIC evaluates the methodology. If, after reviewing the request, the FDIC determines that the bank's methodology is unacceptable, the bank will be required to amend its Call Reports and report according to the generally applicable specifications for PD estimation. The bank will be required to submit amended information for no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination.</P>

              </HD>

              <P>A bank must estimate the PD of a foreign consumer loan according to the general requirements described above unless doing so would be unduly complex or burdensome (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if a bank had to develop separate PD mappings for many different countries). A bank may request to use default rates calculated using fewer observations or score bands than the specified minimums, either in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under that methodology, but must comply with the requirements detailed above for using an alternative methodology.</P>
              <P>When estimating a PD according to the general requirements described above would be unduly complex or burdensome, a bank that is required to calculate PDs for foreign consumer loans under the requirements of the Basel II capital framework may: (1) Use the Basel II approach discussed herein, subject to the terms discussed herein; (2) submit a written request to the FDIC to use its own methodology, but may not use the methodology until approved by the FDIC; or (3) treat the loan as an unscorable consumer loan subject to the de minimis approach described above.</P>
              <P>When estimating a PD according to the general requirements described above would be unduly complex or burdensome, a bank that is not required to calculate PDs for foreign consumer loans under the requirements of the Basel II capital framework may: (1) Treat the loan as an unscorable consumer loan subject to the de minimis approach described above; or (2) submit a written request to the FDIC to use its own methodology, but may not use the methodology until approved by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>When a bank submits a written request to the FDIC to use its own methodology, the FDIC may request additional information from the bank regarding the proposed methodology and the bank must provide the information. The FDIC may grant a bank tentative approval to use the methodology while the FDIC considers it in more detail. If the FDIC ultimately disapproves the methodology, the bank may be required to amend its Call Reports; however, the bank will be required to amend no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination.

              <P>A bank that is required to calculate PDs for foreign consumer loans under the requirements of the Basel II capital framework may estimate the two-year PD of a foreign consumer loan based on the one-year PD used for Basel II capital purposes.<SU>10</SU>
                <FTREF/> The bank <PRTPAGE P="483"/>must submit a written request to the FDIC in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under that methodology. The request must explain in detail how one-year PDs calculated under the Basel II framework are translated to two-year PDs that meet the requirements above. While the range of acceptable approaches is potentially broad, any proposed methodology must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>10</SU> Using these Basel II PDs for this purpose does not imply that a bank's PFR has approved use of these PDs for the Basel II capital framework. If a bank's PFR requires it to revise its Basel II PD methodology, the bank must use revised Basel II PDs to calculate (or recalculate if necessary) corresponding PDs under this Basel II approach.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(a) The bank must use data on a sample of loans for which both the one-year Basel II PDs and two-year final rule PDs can be calculated. The sample may contain both foreign and domestic loans.</P>
              <P>(b) The bank must use the sample data to demonstrate that a meaningful relationship exists between the two types of PD estimates, and the significance and nature of the relationship must be determined using accepted statistical principles and methodologies. For example, to the extent that a linear relationship exists in the sample data, the bank may use an ordinary least-squares regression to determine the best linear translation of Basel II PDs to final rule PDs. The estimated equation should fit the data reasonably well based on standard statistics such as the coefficient of determination; and</P>
              <P>(c) The method must account for any significant variation in the relationship between the two types of PD estimates that exists across consumer products based on the empirical analysis of the data. For example, if the bank is using a linear regression to determine the relationship between PD estimates, it should test whether the parameter estimates are significantly different by product type.</P>
              <P>The bank may report using this approach (if it first notifies the FDIC of its intention to do so), while the FDIC evaluates the methodology. If, after reviewing the methodology, the FDIC determines that the methodology is unacceptable, the bank will be required to amend its Call Reports.

Additional funds include a material disbursement of additional funds or, with respect to a line of credit, a material increase in the amount of the line of credit, but not a disbursement, draw, or the writing of convenience checks within the original limits of the line of credit. A material increase in the amount of a line of credit is defined as a 10 percent or greater increase in the quarter-end line of credit limit; however, a temporary increase in a credit card line of credit is not a material increase;</P>

              <P>Nontraditional mortgage loans include all residential loan products that allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal or interest and include all interest-only products, teaser rate mortgages, and negative amortizing mortgages, with the exception of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or reverse mortgages. A teaser-rate mortgage loan is defined as a mortgage with a discounted initial rate where the lender offers a lower rate and lower payments for part of the mortgage term. A mortgage loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the teaser rate has expired. An interest-only loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the loan begins to amortize.</P>
              <P>Banks must determine whether residential loans meet the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan as of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, as refinance is defined in this Appendix for purposes of higher-risk consumer loans. When a bank acquires a residential loan, it must determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender. If this information is unavailable, the bank must obtain refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party. Refreshed data for residential loans is defined as the most recent data available. The data, however, must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the residential loan. The acquiring bank must also determine whether an acquired loan is higher risk not later than three months after acquisition.</P>
              <P>When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, however, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year or the previous calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Higher-Risk Securitizations</HD>
              <P>Higher-risk securitizations are defined as securitization exposures (except securitizations classified as trading book), where, in aggregate, more than 50 percent of the assets backing the securitization meet either the criteria for higher-risk C &amp; I loans or securities, higher-risk consumer loans, or nontraditional mortgage loans, except those classified as trading book. A securitization exposure is as defined in 12 CFR 324.2, as it may be amended from time to time. A higher-risk securitization excludes the maximum amount that is recoverable from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions.</P>

              <P>A bank must determine whether a securitization is higher risk based upon information as of the date of issuance (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the date the securitization is sold on a market to the public for the first time). The bank must make this determination within the time limit that would apply under this Appendix if the bank were directly acquiring loans or securities of the type underlying the securitization. In making the determination, a bank must use one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(a) For a securitization collateralized by a static pool of loans, whose underlying collateral changes due to the sale or amortization of these loans, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, owned by the securitization on the date of issuance of the securitization.</P>
              <P>(b) For a securitization collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans, whose underlying collateral may change by the purchase of additional assets, including purchases made during a ramp-up period, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the highest amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, allowable under the portfolio guidelines of the securitization.</P>
              <P>A bank is not required to evaluate a securitization on a continuous basis when the securitization is collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans; rather, the bank is only required to evaluate the securitization once.</P>

              <P>A bank is required to use the information that is reasonably available to a sophisticated investor in reasonably determining whether a securitization meets the 50 percent threshold. Information reasonably <PRTPAGE P="485"/>available to a sophisticated investor includes, but is not limited to, offering memoranda, indentures, trustee reports, and requests for information from servicers, collateral managers, issuers, trustees, or similar third parties. When determining whether a revolving trust or similar securitization meets the threshold, a bank may use established criteria, model portfolios, or limitations published in the offering memorandum, indenture, trustee report, or similar documents.</P>
              <P>Sufficient information necessary for a bank to make a definitive determination may not, in every case, be reasonably available to the bank as a sophisticated investor. In such a case, the bank may exercise its judgment in making the determination. In some cases, the bank need not rely upon all of the aforementioned pieces of information to make a higher-risk determination if fewer documents provide sufficient data to make the determination.</P>
              <P>In cases in which a securitization is required to be consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and a bank has access to the necessary information, a bank may opt for an alternative method of evaluating the securitization to determine whether it is higher risk. The bank may evaluate individual loans in the securitization on a loan-by-loan basis and only report as higher risk those loans that meet the definition of a higher-risk asset; any loan within the securitization that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk asset need not be reported as such. When making this evaluation, the bank must follow the provisions of section I.B herein. Once a bank evaluates a securitization for higher-risk asset designation using this alternative evaluation method, it must continue to evaluate all securitizations that it has consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and for which it has the required information, using the alternative evaluation method. For securitizations for which the bank does not have access to information on a loan-by-loan basis, the bank must determine whether the securitization meets the 50 percent threshold in the manner previously described for other securitizations.</P>

              <P>(3) Consumer loans (as defined in this Appendix), except securitizations of consumer loans, whenever originated or purchased;</P>
              <P>(4) Securitizations of C&amp;I and consumer loans (as defined in this Appendix) issued on or after April 1, 2013, including those securitizations issued on or after April 1, 2013, that are partially or fully collateralized by loans originated before April 1, 2013.</P>

              <P>For C&amp;I loans that are either originated or refinanced by a reporting bank before April 1, 2013, or purchased by a reporting bank before April 1, 2013, where the loans are owed to the reporting bank by a borrower that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk C&amp;I borrower as that term is defined in this Appendix (which requires, among other things, that the borrower have obtained a C&amp;I loan or refinanced an existing C&amp;I loan on or after April 1, 2013) and securities purchased before April 1, 2013, that are issued by an entity that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk C&amp;I borrower, as that term is defined in this Appendix, banks must continue to use the transition guidance in the September 2012 Call Report instructions to determine whether to report the loan or security as a higher-risk asset for purposes of the higher-risk assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves ratio. A bank may opt to apply the definition of higher-risk C&amp;I loans and securities in this Appendix to all of its C&amp;I loans and securities, but, if it does so, it must also apply the definition of a higher-risk C&amp;I borrower in this Appendix without regard to when the loan is originally made or refinanced (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> whether made or refinanced before or after April 1, 2013).</P>
              <P>For consumer loans (other than securitizations of consumer loans) originated or purchased prior to April 1, 2013, a bank must determine whether the loan met the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan no later than June 30, 2013.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 327—Description of the Loss Severity Measure</HD>
              <P>The loss severity measure applies a standardized set of assumptions to an institution's balance sheet to measure possible losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution's failure. To determine an institution's loss severity rate, the FDIC first applies assumptions about uninsured deposit and other unsecured liability runoff, and growth in insured deposits, to adjust the size and composition of the institution's liabilities. Assets are then reduced to match any reduction in liabilities.<SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> The institution's asset values are then further reduced so that the Leverage ratio reaches 2 percent.<SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> In both cases, assets are adjusted pro rata to preserve the institution's asset composition. Assumptions regarding loss rates at failure for a given asset category and the extent of secured liabilities are then applied to estimated assets and liabilities at failure to determine whether the institution has enough unencumbered assets to cover domestic deposits. Any projected shortfall is divided by current domestic deposits to obtain an end-of-period loss severity ratio. The loss severity measure is an average loss severity ratio for the three most recent quarters of data available.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> In most cases, the model would yield reductions in liabilities and assets prior to failure. Exceptions may occur for institutions primarily funded through insured deposits, which the model assumes to grow prior to failure.</P>

              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>2</SU> Of course, in reality, runoff and capital declines occur more or less simultaneously as an institution approaches failure. The loss severity measure assumptions simplify this process for ease of modeling.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) Means an insured depository institution that:</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of an eligible insured depository institution's one-time credit shall be applied to the maximum extent allowable by law against that institution's quarterly assessment payment under subpart A of this part, after applying assessment credits awarded under § 327.11(c), until the institution's credit is exhausted.</P>
              <P>(b) The following limitations shall apply to the application of the credit against assessment payments.</P>
              <P>(1) For assessments that become due for assessment periods beginning in calendar years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the credit may not be applied to more than 90 percent of the quarterly assessment.</P>
              <P>(2) For an insured depository institution that exhibits financial, operational, or compliance weaknesses ranging from moderately severe to unsatisfactory, or is not at least adequately capitalized (as defined pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) at the beginning of an assessment period, the amount of the credit that may be applied against the institution's quarterly assessment for that period shall not exceed the amount that the institution would have been assessed if it had been assessed at the average assessment rate for all insured institutions for that period. The FDIC shall determine the average assessment rate for an assessment period based upon its best estimate of the average rate for the period.

              <P>(3) If the FDIC has established a restoration plan pursuant to section 7(b)(3)(E) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may elect to restrict the application of credit amounts, in any assessment period, up to the lesser of:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requests for review of credit amount.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a)(1) As soon as practicable after the publication date of this rule, the FDIC shall notify each insured depository institution by FDIC<E T="03">connect</E> or mail of its 1996 assessment base ratio and credit amount in a Statement of One-Time Credit (“Statement”), if any. An insured depository institution may submit a request for review of the FDIC's determination of the institution's 1996 assessment base ratio or credit amount as shown on the Statement within 30 <PRTPAGE P="491"/>days after the effective date of this rule. Such review may be requested if:</P>
              <P>(i) The institution disagrees with a determination as to eligibility for the credit that relates to that institution's credit amount;</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution disagrees with the calculation of the credit as stated on the Statement; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The institution believes that the 1996 assessment base ratio attributed to the institution on the Statement does not fully or accurately reflect its own 1996 assessment base or appropriate adjustments for successors.</P>
              <P>(2) If an institution does not submit a timely request for review, that institution is barred from subsequently requesting review of its credit amount, subject to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) An insured depository institution may submit a request for review of the FDIC's adjustment to the credit amount in a quarterly invoice within 30 days of the date on which the FDIC provides the invoice. Such review may be requested if:</P>
              <P>(i) The institution disagrees with the calculation of the credit as stated on the invoice; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution believes that the 1996 assessment base ratio attributed to the institution due to the adjustment to the invoice does not fully or accurately reflect appropriate adjustments for successors since the last quarterly invoice.</P>
              <P>(2) If an institution does not submit a timely request for review, that institution is barred from subsequently requesting review of its credit amount, subject to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The request for review shall be submitted to the Division of Finance and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the change sought by the institution. At the time of filing with the FDIC, the requesting institution shall notify, to the extent practicable, any other insured depository institution that would be directly and materially affected by granting the request for review and provide such institution with copies of the request for review, the supporting documentation, and the FDIC's procedures for requests under this subpart. In addition, the FDIC also shall make reasonable efforts, based on its official systems of records, to determine that such institutions have been identified and notified.</P>
              <P>(d) During the FDIC's consideration of the request for review, the amount of credit in dispute shall not be available for use by any institution.</P>
              <P>(e) Within 30 days of being notified of the filing of the request for review, those institutions identified as potentially affected by the request for review may submit a response to such request, along with any supporting documentation, to the Division of Finance, and shall provide copies to the requesting institution. If an institution that was notified under paragraph (c) does not submit a response to the request for review, that institution may not:</P>
              <P>(1) Subsequently dispute the information submitted by other institutions on the transaction(s) at issue in the review process; or</P>
              <P>(2) Appeal the decision by the Director of the Division of Finance.</P>
              <P>(f) If additional information is requested of the requesting or affected institutions by the FDIC, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the FDIC's request for additional information.</P>
              <P>(g) Any institution submitting a timely request for review will receive a written response from the FDIC's Director of the Division of Finance, (or his or her designee), notifying the requesting and affected institutions of the determination of the Director as to whether the requested change is warranted. Notice of the procedures applicable to appeals under paragraph (h) of this section will be included with the Director's written determination. Whenever feasible, the FDIC will provide the institution with the aforesaid written response the later of:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 60 days of receipt by the FDIC of the request for revision;</P>
              <P>(2) If additional institutions have been notified by the requesting institution or the FDIC, within 60 days of the date of the last response to the notification; or</P>

              <P>(3) If additional information has been requested by the FDIC, within 60 days of receipt of the additional information.<PRTPAGE P="492"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the insured depository institution that requested review under this section, or an insured depository institution materially affected by the Director's determination, that disagrees with that determination may appeal to the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee on the same grounds as set forth under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such appeal must be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of the Director's written determination. Notice of the procedures applicable to appeals under this section will be included with the Director's written determination. The decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee shall be the final determination of the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(i) Any adjustment to an institution's credits resulting from a determination by the Director of the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee shall be reflected in the institution's next assessment invoice. The adjustment to credits shall affect future assessments only and shall not result in a retroactive adjustment of assessment amounts owed for prior periods.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Display of official sign.</E> Each insured depository institution shall continuously display the official sign at each station or window where insured deposits are usually and normally received in the depository institution's principal place of business and in all its branches.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Other locations</E>—(i) <E T="03">Within the institution.</E> In addition to locations where display of the official sign is required under this § 328.2(a), an insured depository institution may display the official sign in other locations at the institution.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other facilities.</E> An insured depository institution may display the official sign on or at Remote Service Facilities. If an insured depository institution displays the official sign at a Remote Service Facility, and if there are any noninsured institutions that share in the Remote Service Facility, any insured depository institution that displays the official sign must clearly show that the sign refers only to a designated insured depository institution(s). As used in this part, the term “Remote Service Facility” includes any automated teller machine, cash dispensing machine, point-of-sale terminal, or other remote electronic facility where deposits are received.</P>

However, any such varied sign that is displayed in locations where display of the official sign is required under this § 328.2(a) must not be smaller in size than the official sign and must have the same color for the text and symbols.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Newly insured institutions.</E> A depository institution shall display the official sign no later than its twenty-first day of operation as an insured depository institution, unless the institution promptly requested the official sign from the Corporation, but did not receive it before that date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procuring official sign.</E> An insured depository institution may procure the official sign from the Corporation for official use at no charge. Information on obtaining the official sign is posted on the FDIC's internet Web site, <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov.</E> Alternatively, insured depository institutions may, at their expense, procure from commercial suppliers signs that vary from the official sign in size, color, or material. Any insured depository institution which has promptly submitted a written request for an official sign to the Corporation shall not be deemed to have violated <PRTPAGE P="494"/>this § 328.2 by failing to display the official sign, unless the insured depository institution fails to display the official sign after receipt thereof.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Required changes in sign.</E> The Corporation may require any insured depository institution, upon at least thirty (30) days' written notice, to change the wording of the official sign in a manner deemed necessary for the protection of depositors or others.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Advertisement defined.</E> The term “advertisement,” as used in this part, shall mean a commercial message, in any medium, that is designed to attract public attention or patronage to a product or business.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Official advertising statement.</E> The official advertising statement shall be in substance as follows: “Member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.”</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Size and print.</E> The official advertising statement shall be of such size and print to be clearly legible. If the symbol of the Corporation is used as the official advertising statement, and the symbol must be reduced to such proportions that the two lines of smaller type above and below “FDIC” are indistinct and illegible, those lines of smaller type may be blocked out or dropped.</P>

For purposes of this § 328.3, an advertisement promotes non-specific banking products and services if it includes the name of the insured depository institution but does not list or describe particular products or services offered by the institution. An example of such an advertisement would be, “Anytown Bank, offering a full range of banking services.”</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Foreign depository institutions.</E> When a foreign depository institution has both insured and noninsured U.S. branches, the depository institution must also identify which branches are insured and which branches are not insured in all of its advertisements requiring use of the official advertising statement.</P>

            <P>(3) Signs or plates in the insured depository institution offices or attached to the building or buildings in which such offices are located;</P>

            <P>(10) Advertisements which contain a statement to the effect that the depository institution is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or that the depository institution is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or that its deposits or depositors are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to at least $100,000 for each depositor.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Restrictions on using the official advertising statement when advertising non-deposit products</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Non-deposit product.</E> As used in this part, the term “non-deposit product” shall include, but is not limited to, insurance products, annuities, mutual funds, and securities. For purposes of this definition, a credit product is not a non-deposit product.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Hybrid product.</E> As used in this part, the term “hybrid product” shall mean a product or service that has both deposit product features and non-deposit product features. A sweep account is an example of a hybrid product.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this part is to clarify the rules and define the terms necessary to afford deposit insurance coverage under the Act and provide rules for the recognition of deposit ownership in various circumstances.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 330.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General principles.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Ownership rights and capacities.</E> The insurance coverage provided by the Act and this part is based upon the ownership rights and capacities in which deposit accounts are maintained at insured depository institutions. All deposits in an insured depository institution which are maintained in the same right and capacity (by or for the benefit of a particular depositor or depositors) shall be added together and insured in accordance with this part. Deposits maintained in different rights and capacities, as recognized under this part, shall be insured separately from each other. (Example: Single ownership accounts and joint ownership accounts are insured separately from each other.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Deposits maintained in separate insured depository institutions or in separate branches of the same insured depository institution.</E> Any deposit accounts maintained by a depositor at one insured depository institution are insured separately from, and without regard to, any deposit accounts that the same depositor maintains at any other separately chartered and insured depository institution, even if two or more separately chartered and insured depository institutions are affiliated through common ownership. (Example: Deposits held by the same individual at two different banks owned by the same bank holding company would be insured separately, per bank.)</P>
            <P>The deposit accounts of a depositor maintained in the same right and capacity at different branches or offices of the same insured depository institution are not separately insured; rather they shall be added together and insured in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Deposits maintained by foreigners and deposits denominated in foreign currency.</E> The availability of deposit insurance is not limited to citizens and residents of the United States. Any person or entity that maintains deposits in an insured depository institution is entitled to the deposit insurance provided by the Act and this part. In addition, deposits denominated in a foreign currency shall be insured in accordance with this part. Deposit insurance for such deposits shall be determined and paid in the amount of United States dollars that is equivalent in value to the amount of the deposit denominated in the foreign currency as of close of business on the date of default of the insured depository institution. The exchange rates to be used for such conversions are the 12 PM rates (the “noon buying rates for cable transfers”) quoted for major currencies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of default of the insured depository institution, unless the deposit agreement specifies that some other widely recognized exchange rates are to be used for all purposes under that agreement, in which case, the rates so specified shall be used for such conversions.<PRTPAGE P="528"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Deposits in insured branches of foreign banks.</E> Deposits in an insured branch of a foreign bank which are payable by contract in the United States shall be insured in accordance with this part, except that any deposits to the credit of the foreign bank, or any office, branch, agency or any wholly owned subsidiary of the foreign bank, shall not be insured. All deposits held by a depositor in the same right and capacity in more than one insured branch of the same foreign bank shall be added together for the purpose of determining the amount of deposit insurance.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Deposits payable outside of the United States and certain other locations.</E> (1) Any obligation of an insured depository institution which is payable solely at an office of that institution located outside any State, as the term “State” is defined in section 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(3)), is not a deposit for the purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, any obligation of an insured depository institution which is carried on the books and records of an office of that institution located outside any State, as referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall not be an insured deposit for purposes of this part, or any other provision of this part, notwithstanding that the obligation may also be payable at an office of that institution located within any State.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Rule of construction.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (e), Overseas Military Banking Facilities operated under Department of Defense regulations, 32 CFR Parts 230 and 231, are not considered to be offices located outside any State, as referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">International banking facility deposits.</E> An “international banking facility time deposit,” as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Regulation D (12 CFR 204.8(a)(2)), or in any successor regulation, is not a deposit for the purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Bank investment contracts.</E> As required by section 11(a)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(8)), any liability arising under any investment contract between any insured depository institution and any employee benefit plan which expressly permits “benefit responsive withdrawals or transfers” (as defined in section 11(a)(8) of the Act) are not insured deposits for purposes of this part. The term “substantial penalty or adjustment” used in section 11(a)(8) of the Act means, in the case of a deposit having an original term which exceeds one year, all interest earned on the amount withdrawn from the date of deposit or for six months, whichever is less; or, in the case of a deposit having an original term of one year or less, all interest earned on the amount withdrawn from the date of deposit or three months, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Application of state or local law to deposit insurance determinations.</E> In general, deposit insurance is for the benefit of the owner or owners of funds on deposit. However, while ownership under state law of deposited funds is a necessary condition for deposit insurance, ownership under state law is not sufficient for, or decisive in, determining deposit insurance coverage. Deposit insurance coverage is also a function of the deposit account records of the insured depository institution and of the provisions of this part, which, in the interest of uniform national rules for deposit insurance coverage, are controlling for purposes of determining deposit insurance coverage.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Determination of the amount of a deposit</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The amount of a deposit is the balance of principal and interest unconditionally credited to the deposit account as of the date of default of the insured depository institution, plus the ascertainable amount of interest to that date, accrued at the contract rate (or the anticipated or announced interest or dividend rate), which the insured depository institution in default would have paid if the deposit had matured on that date and the insured depository institution had not failed. In the absence of any such announced or anticipated interest or dividend rate, the rate for this purpose shall be whatever rate was paid in the immediately preceding payment period.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Discounted certificates of deposit.</E> The amount of a certificate of deposit <PRTPAGE P="529"/>sold by an insured depository institution at a discount from its face value is its original purchase price plus the amount of accrued earnings calculated by compounding interest annually at the rate necessary to increase the original purchase price to the maturity value over the life of the certificate.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Waiver of minimum requirements.</E> In the case of a deposit with a fixed payment date, fixed or minimum term, or a qualifying or notice period that has not expired as of such date, interest thereon to the date of closing shall be computed according to the terms of the deposit contract as if interest had been credited and as if the deposit could have been withdrawn on such date without any penalty or reduction in the rate of earnings.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Continuation of insurance coverage following the death of a deposit owner.</E> The death of a deposit owner shall not affect the insurance coverage of the deposit for a period of six months following the owner's death unless the deposit account is restructured. The operation of this grace period, however, shall not result in a reduction of coverage. If an account is not restructured within six months after the owner's death, the insurance shall be provided on the basis of actual ownership in accordance with the provisions of § 330.5(a)(1).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Continuation of separate deposit insurance after merger of insured depository institutions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Whenever the liabilities of one or more insured depository institutions for deposits are assumed by another insured depository institution, whether by merger, consolidation, other statutory assumption or contract:</P>
            <P>(a) The insured status of the institutions whose liabilities have been assumed terminates on the date of receipt by the FDIC of satisfactory evidence of the assumption; and</P>
            <P>(b) The separate insurance of deposits assumed continues for six months from the date the assumption takes effect or, in the case of a time deposit, the earliest maturity date after the six-month period. In the case of time deposits which mature within six months of the date the deposits are assumed and which are renewed at the same dollar amount (either with or without accrued interest having been added to the principal amount) and for the same term as the original deposit, the separate insurance applies to the renewed deposits until the first maturity date after the six-month period. Time deposits that mature within six months of the deposit assumption and that are renewed on any other basis, or that are not renewed and thereby become demand deposits, are separately insured only until the end of the six-month period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Recognition of deposit ownership and fiduciary relationships.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Recognition of deposit ownership</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evidence of deposit ownership.</E> Except as indicated in this paragraph (a)(1) or as provided in § 330.3(j), in determining the amount of insurance available to each depositor, the FDIC shall presume that deposited funds are actually owned in the manner indicated on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution. If the FDIC, in its sole discretion, determines that the deposit account records of the insured depository institution are clear and unambiguous, those records shall be considered binding on the depositor, and the FDIC shall consider no other records on the manner in which the funds are owned. If the deposit account records are ambiguous or unclear on the manner in which the funds are owned, then the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, consider evidence other than the deposit account records of the insured depository institution for the purpose of establishing the manner in which the funds are owned. Despite the general requirements of this paragraph (a)(1), if the FDIC has reason to believe that the insured depository institution's deposit account records misrepresent the actual ownership of deposited funds and such misrepresentation would increase deposit insurance coverage, the FDIC may consider all available evidence and pay claims for insured deposits on the basis of the actual rather than the misrepresented ownership.<PRTPAGE P="530"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Recognition of deposit ownership in custodial accounts.</E> In the case of custodial deposits, the interest of each beneficial owner may be determined on a fractional or percentage basis. This may be accomplished in any manner which indicates that where the funds of an owner are commingled with other funds held in a custodial capacity and a portion thereof is placed on deposit in one or more insured depository institutions without allocation, the owner's insured interest in the deposit in any one insured depository institution would represent, at any given time, the same fractional share as his or her share of the total commingled funds.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fiduciary relationships</E>—(1) <E T="03">Recognition.</E> The FDIC will recognize a claim for insurance coverage based on a fiduciary relationship only if the relationship is expressly disclosed, by way of specific references, in the “deposit account records” (as defined in § 330.1(e)) of the insured depository institution. Such relationships include, but are not limited to, relationships involving a trustee, agent, nominee, guardian, executor or custodian pursuant to which funds are deposited. The express indication that the account is held in a fiduciary capacity will not be necessary, however, in instances where the FDIC determines, in its sole discretion, that the titling of the deposit account and the underlying deposit account records sufficiently indicate the existence of a fiduciary relationship. This exception may apply, for example, where the deposit account title or records indicate that the account is held by an escrow agent, title company or a company whose business is to hold deposits and securities for others.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Details of fiduciary relationships.</E> If the deposit account records of an insured depository institution disclose the existence of a relationship which might provide a basis for additional insurance (including the exception provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the details of the relationship and the interests of other parties in the account must be ascertainable either from the deposit account records of the insured depository institution or from records maintained, in good faith and in the regular course of business, by the depositor or by some person or entity that has undertaken to maintain such records for the depositor.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Multi-tiered fiduciary relationships.</E> In deposit accounts where there are multiple levels of fiduciary relationships, there are two methods of satisfying paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section to obtain insurance coverage for the interests of the true beneficial owners of a deposit account.</P>
            <P>(i) One method is to:</P>
            <P>(A) Expressly indicate, on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, the existence of each and every level of fiduciary relationships; and</P>
            <P>(B) Disclose, at each level, the name(s) and interest(s) of the person(s) on whose behalf the party at that level is acting.</P>
            <P>(ii) An alternative method is to:</P>
            <P>(A) Expressly indicate, on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, that there are multiple levels of fiduciary relationships;</P>
            <P>(B) Disclose the existence of additional levels of fiduciary relationships in records, maintained in good faith and in the regular course of business, by parties at subsequent levels; and</P>
            <P>(C) Disclose, at each of the levels, the name(s) and interest(s) of the person(s) on whose behalf the party at that level is acting. No person or entity in the chain of parties will be permitted to claim that they are acting in a fiduciary capacity for others unless the possible existence of such a relationship is revealed at some previous level in the chain.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Deposits evidenced by negotiable instruments.</E> If any deposit obligation of an insured depository institution is evidenced by a negotiable certificate of deposit, negotiable draft, negotiable cashier's or officer's check, negotiable certified check, negotiable traveler's check, letter of credit or other negotiable instrument, the FDIC will recognize the owner of such deposit obligation for all purposes of claim for insured deposits to the same extent as if his or her name and interest were disclosed on the records of the insured depository institution; provided, that the instrument was in fact negotiated to such owner prior to the <PRTPAGE P="531"/>date of default of the insured depository institution. The owner must provide affirmative proof of such negotiation, in a form satisfactory to the FDIC, to substantiate his or her claim. Receipt of a negotiable instrument directly from the insured depository institution in default shall, in no event, be considered a negotiation of said instrument for purposes of this provision.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Deposit obligations for payment of items forwarded for collection by depository institution acting as agent.</E> Where an insured depository institution in default has become obligated for the payment of items forwarded for collection by a depository institution acting solely as agent, the FDIC will recognize the holders of such items for all purposes of claim for insured deposits to the same extent as if their name(s) and interest(s) were disclosed as depositors on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, when such claim for insured deposits, if otherwise payable, has been established by the execution and delivery of prescribed forms. The FDIC will recognize such depository institution forwarding such items for the holders thereof as agent for such holders for the purpose of making an assignment to the FDIC of their rights against the insured depository institution in default and for the purpose of receiving payment on their behalf.</P>

Qualifying joint accounts in the names of both husband and wife which are comprised of community property funds shall be added together and insured up to twice <PRTPAGE P="533"/>the SMDIA, separately from any funds deposited into accounts bearing their individual names.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of insurance coverage.</E> The interests of each co-owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the total shall be insured up to the SMDIA. (Example: “A&amp;B” have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $150,000; “A&amp;C” have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $200,000; and “A&amp;B&amp;C” have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $375,000. A's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $300,000 ($75,000 plus $100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, A's interest would be insured in the amount of $250,000 and uninsured in the amount of $50,000. B's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $200,000 ($75,000 plus $125,000); therefore, B's interest would be fully insured. C's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $225,000 ($100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, C's interest would be fully insured.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualifying joint accounts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Qualification requirements.</E> A joint deposit account shall be deemed to be a qualifying joint account, for purposes of this section, only if:</P>

            <P>(ii) Each co-owner has personally signed, which may include signing electronically, a deposit account signature card, or the alternative method provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section is satisfied; and</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Evidence of deposit ownership.</E> All deposit accounts that satisfy the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and those accounts that come within the exception provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be deemed to be jointly owned provided that, in accordance with the provisions of § 330.5(a), the FDIC determines that the deposit account records of the insured depository institution are clear and unambiguous as to the ownership of the accounts. If the deposit account records are ambiguous or unclear as to the manner in which the deposit accounts are owned, then the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, consider evidence other than the deposit account records of the insured depository institution for the purpose of establishing the manner in which the funds are owned. The signatures of two or more persons on the deposit account signature card or the names of two or more persons on a certificate of deposit or other deposit instrument shall be conclusive evidence that the account is a joint account (although not necessarily a qualifying joint account) unless the deposit records as a whole are ambiguous and some other evidence indicates, to the satisfaction of the FDIC, that there is a contrary ownership capacity.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Alternative method to satisfy signature-card requirement.</E> The signature-card requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section also may be satisfied by information contained in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution establishing co-ownership of the deposit account, such as evidence that the institution has issued a mechanism for accessing the account to each co-owner or evidence of usage of the deposit account by each co-owner.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Nonqualifying joint accounts.</E> A deposit account held in two or more names which is not a qualifying joint account, for purposes of this section, shall be treated as being owned by each named owner, as an individual, corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association, as the case may be, and the actual ownership interest of each individual or entity in such account shall be added to any other single ownership accounts of such individual or other accounts of such entity, and shall be insured in accordance with the provisions of this part governing the insurance of such accounts.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Revocable trust accounts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the funds owned by an individual and deposited into one or more accounts with respect to which the owner evidences an intention that upon his or her death the funds shall belong to one or more beneficiaries shall be separately insured (from other types of accounts the owner has at the same insured depository institution) in an amount equal to the total number of different beneficiaries named in the account(s) multiplied by the SMDIA. This section applies to all accounts held in connection with informal and formal testamentary revocable trusts. Such informal trusts are commonly referred to as payable-on-death accounts, in-trust-for accounts or Totten Trust accounts, and such formal trusts are commonly referred to as living trusts or family trusts. (<E T="03">Example 1:</E> Account Owner “A” has a living trust account with four different beneficiaries named in the trust. A has no other revocable trust accounts at the same FDIC-insured institution. The maximum insurance coverage would be $1,000,000, determined by multiplying 4 times $250,000 (the number of beneficiaries times the SMDIA). (<E T="03">Example 2:</E> Account Owner “A” has a payable-on-death account naming his niece and cousin as beneficiaries, and A also has, at the same FDIC-insured institution, another payable-on-death account naming the same niece and a friend as beneficiaries. The maximum coverage available to the account owner would be $750,000. This is because the account owner has named only three <E T="03">different</E> beneficiaries in the revocable trust accounts—his niece and cousin in the first, and the same niece and a friend in the second. The naming of the same beneficiary in more than one revocable trust account, whether it be a payable-on-death account or living trust account, does not increase the total coverage amount.) (<E T="03">Example 3:</E> Account Owner “A” establishes a living trust account, with a balance of $300,000, naming his two children “B” and “C” as beneficiaries. A also establishes, at the same FDIC-insured institution, a payable-on-death account, with a balance of $300,000, also naming his children B and C as beneficiaries. The maximum coverage available to A is $500,000, determined by multiplying 2 times $250,000 (the number of different beneficiaries times the SMDIA). A is uninsured in the amount of $100,000. This is because all funds that a depositor holds in both living trust accounts and payable-on-death accounts, at the same FDIC-insured institution and naming the same beneficiaries, are aggregated for insurance purposes and insured to the applicable coverage limits.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Required intention and naming of beneficiaries.</E> (1) The required intention in paragraph (a) of this section that upon the owner's death the funds shall belong to one or more beneficiaries must be manifested in the “title” of the account using commonly accepted terms such as, but not limited to, “in trust for,” “as trustee for,” “payable-on-death to,” or any acronym therefor. For purposes of this requirement, “title” includes the electronic deposit account records of the institution. (For example, the FDIC would recognize an account as a revocable trust account even if the title of the account signature card does not designate the account as a revocable trust account as long as the institution's electronic deposit account records identify (through a code or otherwise) the account as a revocable trust account.) The settlor of a revocable trust shall be presumed to own the funds deposited into the account.</P>

            <P>(2) For informal revocable trust accounts, the beneficiaries must be specifically named in the deposit account <PRTPAGE P="535"/>records of the insured depository institution.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definition of beneficiary.</E> For purposes of this section, a beneficiary includes a natural person as well as a charitable organization and other non-profit entity recognized as such under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Interests of beneficiaries outside the definition of beneficiary in this section.</E> If a beneficiary named in a trust covered by this section does not meet the definition of beneficiary in paragraph (c) of this section, the funds corresponding to that beneficiary shall be treated as the individually owned (single ownership) funds of the owner(s). As such, they shall be aggregated with any other single ownership accounts of such owner(s) and insured up to the SMDIA per owner. (<E T="03">Example:</E> Account Owner “A” establishes a payable-on-death account naming a pet as beneficiary with a balance of $100,000. A also has an individual account at the same FDIC-insured institution with a balance of $175,000. Because the pet is not a “beneficiary,” the two accounts are aggregated and treated as a single ownership account. As a result, A is insured in the amount of $250,000, but is uninsured for the remaining $25,000.)</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Revocable trust accounts with aggregate balances exceeding five times the SMDIA and naming more than five different beneficiaries.</E> Notwithstanding the general coverage provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, for funds owned by an individual in one or more revocable trust accounts naming more than five different beneficiaries and whose aggregate balance is more than five times the SMDIA, the maximum revocable trust account coverage for the account owner shall be the greater of either: five times the SMDIA or the aggregate amount of the interests of each different beneficiary named in the trusts, to a limit of the SMDIA per different beneficiary. (<E T="03">Example 1:</E> Account Owner “A” has a living trust with a balance of $1 million and names two friends, “B” and “C” as beneficiaries. At the same FDIC-insured institution, A establishes a payable-on-death account, with a balance of $1 million naming his two cousins, “D” and “E” as beneficiaries. Coverage is determined under the general coverage provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, and not this paragraph (e). This is because all funds that A holds in both living trust accounts and payable-on-death accounts, at the same FDIC-insured institution, are aggregated for insurance purposes. Although A's aggregated balance of $2 million is more than five times the SMDIA, A names only four different beneficiaries, and coverage under this paragraph (e) applies only if there are more than five different beneficiaries. A is insured in the amount of $1 million (4 beneficiaries times the SMDIA), and uninsured for the remaining $1 million.) (<E T="03">Example 2:</E> Account Owner “A” has a living trust account with a balance of $1,500,000. Under the terms of the trust, upon A's death, A's three children are each entitled to $125,000, A's friend is entitled to $15,000, and a designated charity is entitled to $175,000. The trust also provides that the remainder of the trust assets shall belong to A's spouse. In this case, because the balance of the account exceeds $1,250,000 (5 times the SMDIA) and there are more than five different beneficiaries named in the trust, the maximum coverage available to A would be the greater of: $1,250,000 or the aggregate of each different beneficiary's interest to a limit of $250,000 per beneficiary. The beneficial interests in the trust for purposes of determining coverage are: $125,000 for each of the children (totaling $375,000), $15,000 for the friend, $175,000 for the charity, and $250,000 for the spouse (because the spouse's $935,000 is subject to the $250,000 per-beneficiary limitation). The aggregate beneficial interests total $815,000. Thus, the maximum coverage afforded to the account owner would be $1,250,000, the greater of $1,250,000 or $815,000.)</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Co-owned revocable trust accounts.</E> (1) Where an account described in paragraph (a) of this section is established by more than one owner, the respective interest of each account owner (which shall be deemed equal) shall be insured separately, per different beneficiary, up to the SMDIA, subject to the limitation imposed in paragraph (e) of this section. (<E T="03">Example 1:</E> A and B, two individuals, establish a payable-on-death account naming their three nieces as <PRTPAGE P="536"/>beneficiaries. Neither A nor B has any other revocable trust accounts at the same FDIC-insured institution. The maximum coverage afforded to A and B would be $1,500,000, determined by multiplying the number of owners (2) times the SMDIA ($250,000) times the number of different beneficiaries (3). In this example, A would be entitled to revocable trust coverage of $750,000 and B would be entitled to revocable trust coverage of $750,000.) (<E T="03">Example 2:</E> A and B, two individuals, establish a payable-on-death account naming their two children, two cousins, and a charity as beneficiaries. The balance in the account is $1,750,000. Neither A nor B has any other revocable trust accounts at the same FDIC-insured institution. The maximum coverage would be determined (under paragraph (a) of this section) by multiplying the number of account owners (2) times the number of different beneficiaries (5) times $250,000, totaling $2,500,000. Because the account balance ($1,750,000) is less than the maximum coverage amount ($2,500,000), the account would be fully insured.) (<E T="03">Example 3:</E> A and B, two individuals, establish a living trust account with a balance of $3.75 million. Under the terms of the trust, upon the death of both A and B, each of their three children is entitled to $600,000, B's cousin is entitled to $380,000, A's friend is entitled to $70,000, and the remaining amount ($1,500,000) goes to a charity. Under paragraph (e) of this section, the maximum coverage, as to each co-owned account owner, would be the greater of $1,250,000 or the aggregate amount (as to each co-owner) of the interest of each different beneficiary named in the trust, to a limit of $250,000 per account owner per beneficiary. The beneficial interests in the trust considered for purposes of determining coverage for account owner <E T="03">A</E> are: $750,000 for the children (each child's interest attributable to A, $300,000, is subject to the $250,000-per-beneficiary limitation), $190,000 for the cousin, $35,000 for the friend, and $250,000 for the charity (the charity's interest attributable to A, $750,000, is subject to the $250,000 per-beneficiary limitation). As to A, the aggregate amount of the beneficial interests eligible for deposit insurance coverage totals $1,225,000. Thus, the maximum coverage afforded to account co-owner A would be $1,250,000, which is the greater of $1,250,000 or the aggregate of all the beneficial interests attributable to A (limited to $250,000 per beneficiary), which totaled slightly less at $1,225,000. Because B has equal ownership interest in the trust, the same analysis and coverage determination also would apply to B. Thus, of the total account balance of $3.75 million, $2.5 million would be insured and $1.25 million would be uninsured.)</P>

            <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, where the owners of a co-owned revocable trust account are themselves the sole beneficiaries of the corresponding trust, the account shall be insured as a joint account under § 330.9 and shall not be insured under the provisions of this section. (<E T="03">Example:</E> If A and B establish a payable-on-death account naming themselves as the sole beneficiaries of the account, the account will be insured as a joint account because the account does not satisfy the intent requirement (under paragraph (a) of this section) that the funds in the account belong to the named beneficiaries upon the owners' death. The beneficiaries are in fact the actual owners of the funds during the account owners' lifetimes.)</P>

            <P>(g) For deposit accounts held in connection with a living trust that provides for a life-estate interest for designated beneficiaries, the FDIC shall value each such life estate interest as the SMDIA for purposes of determining the insurance coverage available to the account owner under paragraph (e) of this section. (<E T="03">Example:</E> Account Owner “A” has a living trust account with a balance of $1,500,000. Under the terms of the trust, A provides a life estate interest for his spouse. Moreover, A's three children are each entitled to $275,000, A's friend is entitled to $15,000, and a designated charity is entitled to $175,000. The trust also provides that the remainder of the trust assets shall belong to A's granddaughter. In this case, because the balance of the account exceeds $1,250,000 (5) five times the SMDIA) and there are more than five different beneficiaries named in the trust, the maximum coverage available to A would be the greater of: <PRTPAGE P="537"/>$1,250,000 or the aggregate of each different beneficiary's interest to a limit of $250,000 per beneficiary. The beneficial interests in the trust considered for purposes of determining coverage are: $250,000 for the spouse's life estate, $750,000 for the children (because each child's $275,000 is subject to the $250,000 per-beneficiary limitation), $15,000 for the friend, $175,000 for the charity, and $250,000 for the granddaughter (because the granddaughter's $310,000 remainder is limited by the $250,000 per-beneficiary limitation). The aggregate beneficial interests total $1,440,000. Thus, the maximum coverage afforded to the account owner would be $1,440,000, the greater of $1,250,000 or $1,440,000.)</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Revocable trusts that become irrevocable trusts.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions in section 330.13 on the insurance coverage of irrevocable trust accounts, if a revocable trust account converts in part or entirely to an irrevocable trust upon the death of one or more of the trust's owners, the trust account shall continue to be insured under the provisions of this section. (<E T="03">Example:</E> Assume A and B have a trust account in connection with a living trust, of which they are joint grantors. If upon the death of either A or B the trust transforms into an irrevocable trust as to the deceased grantor's ownership in the trust, the account will continue to be insured under the provisions of this section.)</P>
            <P>(i) This section shall apply to all existing and future revocable trust accounts and all existing and future irrevocable trust accounts resulting from formal revocable trust accounts.</P>

              <P>(i) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party;</P>
              <P>(ii) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples</E>—(i) <E T="03">Adequate opt out notice.</E> You provide adequate notice that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party if you:</P>
              <P>(A) Identify all of the categories of nonpublic personal information that you disclose or reserve the right to disclose, and all of the categories of nonaffiliated third parties to which you disclose the information, as described in § 332.6(a)(2) and (3), and state that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of that information; and</P>
              <P>(B) Identify the financial products or services that the consumer obtains from you, either singly or jointly, to which the opt out direction would apply.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reasonable opt out means.</E> You provide a reasonable means to exercise an opt out right if you:</P>

              <P>(D) Provide a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Unreasonable opt out means.</E> You <E T="03">do not</E> provide a reasonable means of opting out if:</P>
              <P>(A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or</P>
              <P>(B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provide with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Specific opt out means.</E> You may require each consumer to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for that consumer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Same form as initial notice permitted.</E> You may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form as the initial notice you provide in accordance with § 332.4.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial notice required when opt out notice delivered subsequent to initial notice.</E> If you provide the opt out notice later than required for the initial notice in accordance with § 332.4, you must also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.<PRTPAGE P="552"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Joint relationships.</E> (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may provide a single opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer (as explained in paragraph (d)(5) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. You may either:</P>
              <P>(i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.</P>
              <P>(3) If you permit each joint consumer to opt out separately, you must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers.</P>
              <P>(4) You may not require <E T="03">all</E> joint consumers to opt out before you implement <E T="03">any</E> opt out direction.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Example.</E> If John and Mary have a joint checking account with you and arrange for you to send statements to John's address, you may do any of the following, but you must explain in your opt out notice which opt out policy you will follow:</P>
              <P>(i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary.</P>
              <P>(ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out direction.</P>
              <P>(iii) Permit John and Mary to make different opt out directions. If you do so:</P>
              <P>(A) You must permit John and Mary to opt out for each other;</P>
              <P>(B) If both opt out, you must permit both to notify you in a single response (such as on a form or through a telephone call); and</P>
              <P>(C) If John opts out and Mary does not, you may only disclose nonpublic personal information about Mary, but not about John and not about John and Mary jointly.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Time to comply with opt out.</E> You must comply with a consumer's opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive it.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Continuing right to opt out.</E> A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Duration of consumer's opt out direction.</E> (1) A consumer's direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer revokes it in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.</P>
              <P>(2) When a customer relationship terminates, the customer's opt out direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that you collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with you, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the new relationship.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Delivery.</E> When you are required to deliver an opt out notice by this section, you must deliver it according to § 332.9.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Model privacy form.</E> Pursuant to § 332.2(a) of this part, a model privacy form that meets the notice content requirements of this section is included in Appendix A of this part.</P>

The information shall appear in minimum 8-point font as “rev. [month/year]” using either the name or number of the month, such as “rev. July 2009” or “rev. 7/09”.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General instructions for the “What?” box.</E> (1) The bulleted list identifies the types of personal information that the institution collects and shares. All institutions must use the term “Social Security number” in the first bullet.</P>
              <P>(2) Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list: income; account balances; payment history; transaction history; transaction or loss history; credit history; credit scores; assets; investment experience; credit-based insurance scores; insurance claim history; medical information; overdraft history; purchase history; account transactions; risk tolerance; medical-related debts; credit card or other debt; mortgage rates and payments; retirement assets; checking account information; employment information; wire transfer instructions.</P>

Each reason correlates to a specific legal provision described in paragraph C.2(d) of this Instruction. In the middle column, each institution must provide a “Yes” or “No” response that accurately reflects its information sharing policies and practices with respect to the reason listed on the left. In the right column, each institution must provide in each box one of the following three (3) responses, as applicable, that reflects whether a consumer can limit such sharing: “Yes” if it is required to or voluntarily provides an opt-out; “No” if it does not provide an opt-out; or “We don't share” if it answers “No” in the middle column. Only the sixth row (“For our affiliates to market to you”) may be omitted at the option of the institution. <E T="03">See</E> paragraph C.2(d)(6) of this Instruction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific disclosures and corresponding legal provisions.</E> (1) <E T="03">For our everyday business purposes.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information under §§ 332.14 and 332.15 and with service providers pursuant to § 332.13 of this part other than the purposes specified in paragraphs C.2(d)(2) or C.2(d)(3) of these Instructions.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">For our marketing purposes.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information with service providers by an institution for its own marketing pursuant to § 332.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">For joint marketing with other financial companies.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information under joint marketing agreements between two or more financial institutions and with any service provider used in connection with such agreements pursuant to § 332.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about transactions and experiences.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information specified in sections 603(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about creditworthiness.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason must provide an opt-out.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">For our affiliates to market to you.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information specified in section 624 of the FCRA. This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: The institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately. Institutions that include <PRTPAGE P="567"/>this reason must provide an opt-out of indefinite duration. An institution that is required to provide an affiliate marketing opt-out, but does not include that opt-out in the model form under this part, must comply with section 624 of the FCRA and 12 CFR part 334, subpart C, with respect to the initial notice and opt-out and any subsequent renewal notice and opt-out. An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">For nonaffiliates to market to you.</E> This reason incorporates sharing described in §§ 332.7 and 332.10(a) of this part. An institution that shares personal information for this reason must provide an opt-out.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">To limit our sharing:</E> A financial institution must include this section of the model form <E T="03">only</E> if it provides an opt-out. The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Institutions must select one or more of the applicable opt-out methods described: Telephone, such as by a toll-free number; a Web site; or use of a mail-in opt-out form. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled “Please note” institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked “[30].” Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.</P>

Institutions that require customers to provide only name and address may omit the section identified as “[account #].” Institutions that require additional or different information, such as a random opt-out number or a truncated account number, to implement an opt-out election should modify the “[account #]” reference accordingly. This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: In the far right of this form (<E T="03">see</E> version 3); or below the form (<E T="03">see</E> version 4). The reverse side of the mail-in opt-out form must not include any content of the model form.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Joint accountholder.</E> Only institutions that provide their joint accountholders the choice to opt out for only one accountholder, in accordance with paragraph C.3(a)(5) of these Instructions, must include in the far left column of the mail-in form the following statement: “If you have a joint account, your choice(s) will apply to everyone on your account unless you mark below. □ Apply my choice(s) only to me.” The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services, provide this option, and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in this statement. Institutions that do not provide this option may eliminate this left column from the mail-in form.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">FCRA Section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) opt-out.</E> If the institution shares personal information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “□ Do not share information about my creditworthiness with your affiliates for their everyday business purposes.”</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonaffiliate opt-out.</E> If the financial institution shares personal information pursuant to § 332.10(a) of this part, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “□ Do not share my personal information with nonaffiliates to market their products and services to me.”</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional opt-outs.</E> Financial institutions that use the disclosure table to provide opt-out options beyond those required by Federal law must provide those opt-outs in this section of the model form. A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for its own marketing in the mail-in opt-out form must include one of the two following statements: “□ Do not share my personal information to market to me.” <E T="03">or</E> “□ Do not use my personal information to market to me.” A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for joint marketing must include the following statement: “□ Do not share my personal information with other financial institutions to jointly market to me.”<PRTPAGE P="568"/>

              <SUBJECT>Conversions from mutual to stock form.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to the conversion of insured mutual state savings banks to the stock form of ownership. It supplements the procedural and other requirements for such conversions in subpart I of part 303 of this chapter. This section also applies, to the extent appropriate, to the reorganization of insured mutual state savings banks to the mutual holding company form of ownership. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section do not apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings banks whose capital category under § 325.103 of this chapter or § 324.403, as applicable, is “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section do not apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings banks whose capital category <PRTPAGE P="570"/>under § 324.403 of this chapter is “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of Eligible Depositor.</E> For purposes of this section, <E T="03">eligible depositors</E> are depositors holding qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of directors/trustees.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> In addition to other requirements that may be imposed by the applicable state statutes and regulations and other federal statutes and regulations, including subpart I of part 303 of this chapter, an insured mutual state savings bank shall not convert to the stock form of ownership unless the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) Eligible depositors shall have higher subscription rights than employee stock ownership plans;</P>
              <P>(2) The proposed conversion shall be approved by a vote of at least a majority of the bank's depositors and, as reasonably determined by the bank's directors or trustees, other stakeholders of the bank who are entitled to vote on the conversion, unless the applicable state law requires a higher percentage, in which case the higher percentage shall be used. Voting may be in person or by proxy; and</P>
              <P>(3) Management shall not use proxies executed outside the context of the proposed conversion to satisfy the voting requirement imposed in the previous paragraph.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Restriction on repurchase of stock.</E> An insured mutual state savings bank that has converted from the mutual to stock form of ownership may not repurchase its capital stock within one year following the date of its conversion to stock form, except that stock repurchases of no greater than 5% of the bank's outstanding capital stock may be repurchased during this one-year period where compelling and valid business reasons are established, to the satisfaction of the FDIC. Any stock repurchases shall be subject to the requirements of section 18(i)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Stock benefit plan limitations.</E> The FDIC will presume that a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan that does not conform with the applicable percentage limitations of the regulations issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision constitutes excessive insider benefits and thereby evidences a breach of the board of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility. In addition, no converted insured mutual state savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the conversion, implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan, unless each of the following requirements is met:</P>
              <P>(1) Each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials;</P>
              <P>(2) All such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion;</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months following the stock issuance;</P>
              <P>(4) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and</P>
              <P>(5) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Form of notice.</E> Any written or electronic notice that the card issuer provides under this paragraph must be <PRTPAGE P="575"/>clear and conspicuous and provided separately from its regular correspondence with the cardholder.</P>

              <P>In designing its Program, a financial institution or creditor may incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Risk Factors.</E> A financial institution or creditor should consider the following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for covered accounts, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;</P>
              <P>(2) The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;</P>
              <P>(3) The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and</P>
              <P>(4) Its previous experiences with identity theft.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sources of Red Flags.</E> Financial institutions and creditors should incorporate relevant Red Flags from sources such as:</P>
              <P>(1) Incidents of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has experienced;</P>
              <P>(2) Methods of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks; and</P>
              <P>(3) Applicable supervisory guidance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Categories of Red Flags.</E> The Program should include relevant Red Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this Appendix J.</P>
              <P>(1) Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection services;</P>
              <P>(2) The presentation of suspicious documents;</P>
              <P>(3) The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address change;</P>
              <P>(4) The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account; and</P>
              <P>(5) Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial institution or creditor.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">III. <E T="03">Detecting Red Flags.</E>
              </HD>
              <P>The Program's policies and procedures should address the detection of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:</P>
              <P>(a) Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity of, a person opening a covered account, for example, using the policies and procedures regarding identification and verification set forth in the Customer Identification Program rules implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(l) (31 CFR 1020.220); and</P>
              <P>(b) Authenticating customers, monitoring transactions, and verifying the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing covered accounts.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">IV. <E T="03">Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft.</E>
              </HD>
              <P>The Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution, creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;</P>
              <P>(b) Contacting the customer;</P>
              <P>(c) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account;</P>

              <P>(d) Reopening a covered account with a new account number;<PRTPAGE P="576"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Not opening a new covered account;</P>
              <P>(f) Closing an existing covered account;</P>
              <P>(g) Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector;</P>
              <P>(h) Notifying law enforcement; or</P>
              <P>(i) Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">V. <E T="03">Updating the Program.</E>
              </HD>
              <P>Financial institutions and creditors should update the Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on factors such as:</P>
              <P>(a) The experiences of the financial institution or creditor with identity theft;</P>
              <P>(b) Changes in methods of identity theft;</P>
              <P>(c) Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;</P>
              <P>(d) Changes in the types of accounts that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains; and</P>
              <P>(e) Changes in the business arrangements of the financial institution or creditor, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">VI. Methods for Administering the Program</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Oversight of Program.</E> Oversight by the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated employee at the level of senior management should include:</P>
              <P>(1) Assigning specific responsibility for the Program's implementation;</P>
              <P>(2) Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 334.90 of this part; and</P>
              <P>(3) Approving material changes to the Program as necessary to address changing identity theft risks.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reports.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Staff of the financial institution or creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated employee at the level of senior management, at least annually, on compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 334.90 of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Contents of report.</E> The report should address material matters related to the Program and evaluate issues such as: the effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Oversight of service provider arrangements.</E> Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements</HD>
              <P>Financial institutions and creditors should be mindful of other related legal requirements that may be applicable, such as:</P>
              <P>(a) For financial institutions and creditors that are subject to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), filing a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable law and regulation;</P>
              <P>(b) Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h) regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the financial institution or creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;</P>
              <P>(c) Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate; and</P>
              <P>(d) Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from identity theft.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Supplement A to Appendix J</HD>
              <P>In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended in section II.b. of the Guidelines in Appendix J of this part, each financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Alerts, Notifications or Warnings from a Consumer Reporting Agency</HD>
              <P>1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.</P>
              <P>2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.</P>

              <P>3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in 12 CFR 1022.82(b).<PRTPAGE P="577"/>
              </P>
              <P>4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:</P>
              <P>a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;</P>
              <P>b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;</P>
              <P>c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or</P>
              <P>d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Suspicious Documents</HD>
              <P>5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.</P>
              <P>6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.</P>
              <P>7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification.</P>
              <P>8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check.</P>
              <P>9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Suspicious Personal Identifying Information</HD>
              <P>10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
              <P>a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or</P>
              <P>b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.</P>
              <P>11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.</P>
              <P>12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
              <P>a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or</P>
              <P>b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.</P>
              <P>13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
              <P>a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or</P>
              <P>b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.</P>
              <P>14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.</P>
              <P>15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.</P>
              <P>16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.</P>
              <P>17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.</P>
              <P>18. For financial institutions and creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account</HD>
              <P>19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement card or a cell phone, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.</P>
              <P>20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:</P>
              <P>a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics equipment or jewelry); or</P>
              <P>b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.</P>
              <P>21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:</P>
              <P>a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;</P>
              <P>b. A material increase in the use of available credit;</P>
              <P>c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;</P>
              <P>d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in connection with a deposit account; or</P>
              <P>e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a cellular phone account.</P>

              <P>22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of <PRTPAGE P="578"/>account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).</P>
              <P>23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.</P>
              <P>24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.</P>
              <P>25. The financial institution or creditor is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Notice From Customers, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in Connection With Covered Accounts Held by the Financial Institution or Creditor</HD>
              <P>26. The financial institution or creditor is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.</P>

            <P>(a) This part is issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) under section 12(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (the Exchange Act), and applies to all securities of FDIC-insured State nonmember banks (including foreign banks having an insured branch) and State savings associations that are subject to the registration requirements of section 12(b) or section 12(g) of the Exchange Act). The FDIC is vested with the powers, functions, and duties of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to administer and enforce sections 10A(m), 12, 13, 14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f), and 16 of the Exchange Act) (15 U.S.C. 78j-1, 78<E T="03">l,</E> 78m, 78n(a), 78n(c), 78n(d), 78n(f), and 78p), and sections 302, 303, 304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7261, 7262, 7264, and 7265) regarding State nonmember banks and State savings associations with one or more classes of securities subject to the registration provisions of sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act.</P>

            <P>(b) Part 335 generally incorporates through cross reference the regulations of the SEC as these regulations are issued, revised, or updated from time to time under sections 10A(m), 12, 13, 14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f), and 16 of the Exchange Act and sections 302, 303, 304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), except as provided at § 335.801 of this part.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing fees.</E> Filing fees will not be charged relative to any filings or submissions of materials made with the FDIC pursuant to the cross reference to regulations of the SEC issued under sections 10A(m), 12, 13, 14, and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78), sections 302, 303, 304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7261, 7262, 7264, and 7265), and this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Electronic filings.</E> (1) The FDIC does not participate in the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering <PRTPAGE P="583"/>Analysis and Retrieval) electronic filing program (17 CFR part 232). The FDIC permits voluntary electronically transmitted filings and submissions of correspondence and other materials in electronic format to the FDIC, with the exception of Beneficial Ownership Reports (Forms 3, 4, and 5) for which electronic filing is mandatory. Beneficial Ownership Report filing requirements are provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) All reporting persons must electronically file Beneficial Ownership Reports (FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5), including amendments and exhibits thereto, using the Internet-based interagency Beneficial Ownership Filings System, except that a reporting person that has obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the forms with the FDIC in paper format. For electronic filing purposes, FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5 are accessible at the Internet-based interagency Web site for Beneficial Ownership Filings at FDIC<E T="03">connect</E> at <E T="03">https://www2.fdicconnect.gov/index.asp.</E> These forms and the instructions thereto are available for printing and downloading at <E T="03">http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/forms.</E> A reporting person that has obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the appropriate forms with the FDIC in paper format. Instructions for continuing hardship exemptions are provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Electronic filings of FDIC beneficial ownership report Forms 3, 4, and 5 must be submitted to the FDIC through the interagency Beneficial Ownership Filings system. Beneficial ownership reports and any amendments are deemed filed with the FDIC upon electronic receipt on business days from 8 a.m. through 10 p.m., Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect (Eastern Time). Business days include each day, except Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays. All filings submitted electronically to the FDIC commencing after 10 p.m. Eastern Time on business days shall be deemed filed as of 8 a.m. on the following business day. All filings submitted electronically to the FDIC on non-business days shall be deemed filed as of 8 a.m. on the following business day.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Adjustment of the filing date.</E> If an electronic filer in good faith attempts to file a beneficial ownership report with the FDIC in a timely manner but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request an adjustment of the filing date of such submission. The FDIC may grant the request if it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> (i) Exhibits to an electronic filing that have not previously been filed with the FDIC shall be filed in electronic format, absent a hardship exemption.</P>
            <P>(ii) Previously filed exhibits, whether in paper or electronic format, may be incorporated by reference into an electronic filing to the extent permitted by applicable SEC rules under the Exchange Act. An electronic filer may, at its option, restate in electronic format an exhibit incorporated by reference that originally was filed in paper format.</P>
            <P>(iii) Any document filed in paper format in violation of mandated electronic filing requirements shall not be incorporated by reference into an electronic filing.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Continuing Hardship Exemption.</E> The FDIC will not accept in paper format any beneficial ownership report filing required to be submitted electronically under this part unless the filer satisfies the requirements for a continuing hardship exemption:</P>

            <P>(i) A filer may apply in writing for a continuing hardship exemption if all or part of a filing or group of filings otherwise required to be filed in electronic format cannot be so filed without undue burden or expense. Such written application shall be made at least ten business days prior to the required due date of the filing(s) or the proposed filing date, as appropriate, or within such shorter period as may be permitted. The written application shall be sent to the Accounting and Securities Disclosure Section, Division of Risk Management Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429, and shall <PRTPAGE P="584"/>contain the information set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(A) The application shall not be deemed granted until the applicant is notified by the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(B) If the FDIC denies the application for a continuing hardship exemption, the filer shall file the required document in electronic format on the required due date or the proposed filing date or such other date as may be permitted.</P>
            <P>(C) If the FDIC determines that the grant of the exemption is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors and so notifies the applicant, the filer shall follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) The request for the continuing hardship exemption shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(A) The reason(s) that the necessary hardware and software are not available without unreasonable burden and expense;</P>

            <P>(ii) The extension(s) of credit was not made in the ordinary course of business; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The extension(s) of credit has involved or presently involves more than a normal risk of collectibility or other unfavorable features including the restructuring of an extension of credit, or a delinquency as to payment of interest or principal.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Proxy material required to be filed.</E> (1) Three preliminary copies of each information statement, proxy statement, form of proxy, and other item of soliciting material to be furnished to security holders concurrently therewith, shall be filed with the FDIC by the bank, State savings association, or any other person making a solicitation subject to 12 CFR 335.401 at least ten calendar days (or 15 calendar days in the case of other than routine meetings, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) prior to the date such item is first sent or given to any security holders, or such shorter date as may be authorized.</P>
            <P>(2) For the purposes of this paragraph (e), a routine meeting means:</P>
            <P>(i) A meeting with respect to which no one is soliciting proxies subject to 12 CFR 335.401 other than on behalf of the bank or State savings association and at which the bank or State savings association intends to present no matters other than:</P>

            <P>(ii) The bank or State savings association does not comment upon or refer to a solicitation in opposition (as defined in 17 CFR 240.14a-6) in connection with the meeting in its proxy material.</P>
            <P>(3) Where preliminary copies of material are filed with the FDIC under this section, the printing of definitive copies for distribution to security holders should be deferred until the comments of the FDIC's staff have been received and considered.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional information; filing of other statements in certain cases.</E> (1) In addition to the information expressly required to be included in a statement, form, schedule or report, there shall be added such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.</P>
            <P>(2) The FDIC may, upon the written request of the bank or State savings association, and where consistent with the protection of investors, permit the omission of one or more of the statements or disclosures herein required, or the filing in substitution therefor of appropriate statements or disclosures of comparable character.</P>

            <P>(3) The FDIC may also require the filing of other statements or disclosures in addition to, or in substitution for those herein required in any case where <PRTPAGE P="586"/>such statements are necessary or appropriate for an adequate presentation of the financial condition of any person whose financial statements are required, or disclosure about which is otherwise necessary for the protection of investors.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standby letters of credit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> As used in this section, the term <E T="03">standby letter of credit</E> means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement however named or described, which represents an obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer: (1) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party, or (2) to make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party, or (3) to make payment on account of any default (including any statement of default) by the account party in the performance of an obligation. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> The term <E T="03">similar arrangement</E> includes the creation of an acceptance or similar undertaking.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> As defined in this paragraph (a), the term <E T="03">standby letter of credit</E> would not include commercial letters of credit and similar instruments where the issuing bank expects the beneficiary to draw upon the issuer, which do not “guaranty” payment of a money obligation of the account party and which do not provide that payment is occasioned by default on the part of the account party.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Restriction.</E> A standby letter of credit issued by an insured State nonmember bank shall be combined with all other standby letters of credit and all loans for purposes of applying any legal limitation on loans of the bank (including limitations on loans to any one borrower, on loans to affiliates of the bank, or on aggregate loans); <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if such standby letter of credit is subject to separate limitation under applicable State or federal law, then the separate limitation shall apply in lieu of the loan limitation. <SU>2</SU>

            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> Where the standby letter of credit is subject to a non-recourse participation agreement with another bank or other banks, this section shall apply to the issuer and each participant in the same manner as in the case of a participated loan.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> All standby letters of credit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section except where:</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to or at the time of issuance, the issuing bank is paid an amount equal to the bank's maximum liability under the standby letter of credit; or,</P>
            <P>(2) Prior to or at the time of issuance, the issuing bank has set aside sufficient funds in a segregated deposit account, clearly earmarked for that purpose, to cover the bank's maximum liability under the standby letter of credit.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Disclosure.</E> Each insured State nonmember bank must maintain adequate control and subsidiary records of its standby letters of credit comparable to the records maintained in connection with the bank's direct loans so that at all times the bank's potential liability thereunder and the bank's compliance with this section may be readily determined. In addition, all such standby letters of credit must be adequately reflected on the bank's published financial statements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Limits on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of insured nonmember banks.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) With the exception of 12 CFR 215.5(b), 215.5(c)(3), 215.5(c)(4), and 215.11, insured nonmember banks are subject to the restrictions contained in subpart A of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR part 215, subpart A) to the same extent and to the same manner as though they were member banks.</P>
            <P>(b) For the purposes of compliance with § 215.4(b) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, no insured nonmember bank may extend credit or grant a line of credit to any of its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of any such person in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit and lines of credit by the bank to that person and to all related interests of that person, exceeds the greater of $25,000 or five percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus, <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> or $500,000 unless (1) the extension of credit or line of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire board of directors of that bank and (2) the interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> For the purposes of § 337.3, an insured nonmember bank's capital and unimpaired surplus shall have the same meaning as found in § 215.2(f) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (§ 215.2(f) of this chapter). For a qualifying community banking organization (as defined in § 324.12 of this chapter) that is subject to the community bank leverage ratio framework (as defined in § 324.12 of this chapter), capital and unimpaired surplus shall mean the FDIC-supervised institution's tier 1 capital (as defined in § 324.2 of this chapter) plus adjusted allowances for credit losses or allowances for loan and lease losses, as applicable (as defined in § 324.2 of this chapter).</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(c)(1) No insured nonmember bank may extend credit in an aggregate amount greater than the amount permitted in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to a partnership in which one or more of the bank's executive officers are partners and, either individually or together, hold a majority interest. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the total amount of credit extended by an insured nonmember bank to such partnership is considered to be extended to each executive officer of the insured nonmember bank who is a member of the partnership.</P>
            <P>(2) An insured nonmember bank is authorized to extend credit to any executive officer of the bank for any other purpose not specified in § 215.5(c)(1) and (2) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR 215.5(c)(1) and (2)) if the aggregate amount of such other extensions of credit does not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000 but in no event more than $100,000, provided, however, that no such extension of credit shall be subject to this limit if the extension of credit is secured by:</P>
            <P>(i) A perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or in other such obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;</P>
            <P>(ii) Unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account in the lending bank.</P>
            <P>(3) Any extension of credit that was outstanding on May 28, 1992 and that would if made on or after that date violate paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (c)(2) of this § 337.3 shall be reduced in amount by May 28, 1993 so that the extension of credit is in compliance with the lending limit set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. Any renewal or extension of such an extension of credit on or after May 28, 1992 shall be made only on terms that will bring the extension of credit into compliance with the lending limit of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section by May 28, 1993, however, any extension of credit made before May 28, 1992 that bears a specific maturity date of May 28, 1993 or later shall be repaid in accordance with its repayment schedule in existence on or before May 28, 1992.</P>

            <P>(4) If an insured nonmember bank is unable to bring all extensions of credit <PRTPAGE P="593"/>outstanding as of May 28, 1992 into compliance as required by paragraph (c)(3) of this § 337.3, the bank may at the discretion of the appropriate FDIC regional director (Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC)) obtain, for good cause shown, not more than two additional one-year periods to come into compliance.</P>
            <P>(5) For the purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the definitions of the terms used in Federal Reserve Board Regulation O shall apply including the exclusion of executive officers of a bank's parent bank holding company and executive officers of any other subsidiary of that bank holding company from the definition of executive officer for the purposes of complying with the loan restrictions contained in section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act. For the purposes of complying with § 215.5(d) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, the reference to “the amount specified for a category of credit in paragraph (c) of this section” shall be understood to refer to the amount specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this § 337.3.</P>

            <P>(f) A market is any readily defined geographical area in which the rates offered by any one insured depository institution soliciting deposits in that area may affect the rates offered by other insured depository institutions operating in the same area. The effective yield on a deposit with an odd maturity shall be determined by interpolating between the yields offered by other insured depository institutions on deposits of the next longer and shorter maturities offered in the market. For purposes of this § 337.6, a presumption shall exist that the prevailing rate or effective yield in the relevant market is the national rate as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section unless the FDIC determines, in its sole discretion based on available evidence, that the effective yield in that market differs from the national rate. Evidence of the effective yield in a particular market may include (but is not limited to) the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Evidence as to the rates paid by other insured depository institutions in the same State, county or metropolitan statistical area (though the FDIC shall not be obligated to recognize each State, county or metropolitan statistical area as a separate market area);</P>
            <P>(2) Evidence as to the rates paid by credit unions in the same market area if the FDIC determines that the insured depository institution competes directly with these credit unions; and</P>

            <P>(3) Evidence as to the different rates paid on different deposit products in the same market area (though the FDIC shall not be obligated to recognize all alleged distinctions among various deposit products). (<E T="03">Example:</E> For a particular market, evidence exists that the rates on money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) differ from the rates on negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts. MMDAs are distinguishable from NOW accounts in that the two types of accounts are subject to different legal requirements. Under these circumstances, for this market, the FDIC could recognize that the prevailing rate on MMDAs is different than the prevailing rate on NOW accounts.)</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if:</P>
            <P>(i) The loan is an extension of credit primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes;</P>
            <P>(ii) The loan is in a subordinate position to a senior lien secured by the same residential improved real estate or mobile home for which the borrower has obtained flood insurance coverage that meets the requirements of § 339.3(a);</P>
            <P>(iii) Flood insurance coverage for the residential improved real estate or mobile home is provided by a policy that:</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duration of exception.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, determines at any time during the term of a designated loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, that an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply, then the FDIC-supervised institution or its servicer shall require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under § 339.3(a) as soon as reasonably practicable and, if applicable, shall provide any disclosure required under section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Escrow account.</E> The FDIC-supervised institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall deposit the flood insurance premiums and fees on behalf of the borrower in an escrow account.

            <P>(ii) On or before July 6, 2012:</P>
            <P>(A) Was not required under Federal or State law to deposit taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any other charges in an escrow account for the entire term of any loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home; and</P>
            <P>(B) Did not have a policy of consistently and uniformly requiring the deposit of taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any other charges in an escrow account for any loans secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Change in status.</E> If an FDIC-supervised institution previously qualified for the exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but no longer qualifies for the exception because it had assets of $1 billion or more for two consecutive calendar year ends, the FDIC-supervised institution must escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance pursuant to paragraph (a) for any designated loan made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after July 1 of the first calendar year of changed status.</P>

            <P>(i) The loan or the FDIC-supervised institution qualifies for an exception from the escrow requirement under paragraphs (a)(2) or (c) of this section, respectively;</P>
            <P>(ii) The borrower is already escrowing all premiums and fees for flood insurance for the loan; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The FDIC-supervised institution is required to escrow flood insurance premiums and fees pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice.</E> For any loan subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall mail or deliver to the borrower no later than June 30, 2016, or September 30 of the first calendar year in which the FDIC-supervised institution has had a change in status pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a notice in writing, or if the borrower agrees, electronically, informing the borrower of the option to escrow all premiums and fees for any required flood insurance and the method(s) by which the borrower may request the escrow, using language similar to the model clause in appendix B to this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Timing.</E> The FDIC-supervised institution or servicer must begin escrowing premiums and fees for flood insurance as soon as reasonably practicable after the FDIC-supervised institution or servicer receives the borrower's request to escrow.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 339—Sample Form of Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance</HD>
            <P>We are giving you this notice to inform you that:</P>
            <P>The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.</P>

            <P>The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's <E T="03">Flood Insurance Rate Map</E> or the <E T="03">Flood Hazard Boundary Map</E> for the following community: ___. This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).</P>
            <P>Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.</P>
            <P>__The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.</P>
            <P>• At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover <E T="03">the lesser of:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; <E T="03">or</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.</P>
            <P>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself.</P>
            <P>• Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.</P>
            <P>• Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage</HD>

            <P>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance <PRTPAGE P="610"/>agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">[Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans</HD>
            <P>Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.]</P>
            <P>__Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the statutory authority for the regulation, what are its purpose and scope, and can the FDIC have other policies on related topics?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The statutory authority for adopting this part is section 11(p) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1821(p). Section 11(p) was added to the FDI Act by section 20 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (Pub. L. 103-204, 107 Stat. 2369 (1993)).<PRTPAGE P="611"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is to prohibit individuals or entities that improperly profited or engaged in wrongdoing at the expense of a failed institution or covered financial company, or seriously mismanaged a failed institution, from buying assets of a failed institution from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) The restrictions of this part generally apply to sales of assets of failed institutions owned or controlled by the FDIC in any capacity.</P>
            <P>(2) The restrictions in this section apply to the sale of assets of a subsidiary of a failed institution or a bridge depository institution if the FDIC controls the terms of the sale by agreement or in its role as shareholder.</P>
            <P>(3) Unless we determine otherwise, this part does not apply to the sale of securities in connection with the investment of corporate and receivership funds pursuant to the Investment Policy for Liquidation Funds managed by the FDIC as it is in effect from time to time.</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of a sale of securities backed by a pool of assets that may include assets of failed institutions by a trust or other entity, this part applies only to the sale of assets by the FDIC to an underwriter in an initial offering, and not to any other purchaser of the securities.</P>
            <P>(5) The restrictions of this part do not apply to a sale of a security or a group or index of securities, a commodity, or any qualified financial contract that, in each case, customarily is traded through a financial intermediary, as defined in § 340.2, where the seller cannot control selection of the purchaser and the sale is consummated through that customary practice.</P>
            <P>(6) The restrictions of this part do not apply to a judicial sale or a trustee's sale of property that secures an obligation to the FDIC where the sale is not conducted or controlled by the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(d) The FDIC retains the authority to establish other policies restricting asset sales. Neither 12 U.S.C. 1821(p) nor this part in any way limits the authority of the FDIC to establish policies prohibiting the sale of assets to prospective purchasers who have injured any failed institution, or to other prospective purchasers, such as certain employees or contractors of the FDIC, or individuals who are not in compliance with the terms of any debt or duty owed to the FDIC. Any such policies may be independent of, in conjunction with, or in addition to the restrictions set forth in this part.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Referrals.</E> Any person who accepts deposits from the public in an area where such transactions are routinely conducted in the institution may refer a consumer who seeks to purchase an insurance product or annuity to a qualified person who sells that product only if the person making the referral receives no more than a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purposes.</E> In enacting the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Congress required each appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the institution is chartered, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution, and to take this record into account in the agency's evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by the institution. This part is intended to carry out the purposes of the CRA by:</P>

The <E T="03">assessment area</E> of an insured State branch is the community or communities located within the United States served by the branch as described in § 345.41.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Certain special purpose banks.</E> This part does not apply to special purpose banks that do not perform commercial or retail banking services by granting credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as incident to their specialized operations. These banks include banker's banks, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), and banks that engage only in one or more of the following activities: providing cash management controlled disbursement services or serving as correspondent banks, trust companies, or clearing agents.</P>

              <P>(1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of housing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank's assessment area(s);</P>
              <P>(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank's assessment area(s) maintained by the bank or obtained from community organizations, state, local, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or other sources;</P>
              <P>(3) The bank's product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by the bank;</P>
              <P>(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the bank, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and any other factors that significantly affect the bank's ability to provide lending, investments, or services in its assessment area(s);</P>
              <P>(5) The bank's past performance and the performance of similarly situated lenders;</P>
              <P>(6) The bank's public file, as described in § 345.43, and any written comments about the bank's CRA performance submitted to the bank or the FDIC; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assigned ratings.</E> The FDIC assigns to a bank one of the following four ratings pursuant to § 345.28 and Appendix A of this part: “outstanding”; “satisfactory”; “needs to improve”; or “substantial noncompliance” as provided in 12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The rating assigned by the FDIC reflects the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Safe and sound operations.</E> This part and the CRA do not require a bank to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the contrary, the FDIC anticipates banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit. Banks are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.<PRTPAGE P="632"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers.</E> In assessing and taking into account the record of a bank under this part, the FDIC considers, as a factor, low-cost education loans originated by the bank to borrowers, particularly in its assessment area(s), who have an individual income that is less than 50 percent of the area median income. For purposes of this paragraph, “low-cost education loans” means any education loan, as defined in section 140(a)(7) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)(7)) (including a loan under a state or local education loan program), originated by the bank for a student at an “institution of higher education,” as that term is generally defined in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S. Department of Education, with interest rates and fees no greater than those of comparable education loans offered directly by the U.S. Department of Education. Such rates and fees are specified in section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions.</E> In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned bank under this part, the FDIC considers as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the bank in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help meet the credit needs of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need not also benefit the bank's assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's assessment area(s).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Lending test.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of test.</E> (1) The lending test evaluates a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through its lending activities by considering a bank's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and community development lending. If consumer lending constitutes a substantial majority of a bank's business, the FDIC will evaluate the bank's consumer lending in one or more of the following categories: motor vehicle, credit card, other secured, and other unsecured loans. In addition, at a bank's option, the FDIC will evaluate one or more categories of consumer lending, if the bank has collected and maintained, as required in § 345.42(c)(1), the data for each category that the bank elects to have the FDIC evaluate.</P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC considers originations and purchases of loans. The FDIC will also consider any other loan data the bank may choose to provide, including data on loans outstanding, commitments and letters of credit.</P>
              <P>(3) A bank may ask the FDIC to consider loans originated or purchased by consortia in which the bank participates or by third parties in which the bank has invested only if the loans meet the definition of community development loans and only in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The FDIC will not consider these loans under any criterion of the lending test except the community development lending criterion.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance criteria.</E> The FDIC evaluates a bank's lending performance pursuant to the following criteria:</P>

              <P>(ii) The dispersion of lending in the bank's assessment area(s); and</P>
              <P>(iii) The number and amount of loans in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies in the bank's assessment area(s);</P>

              <P>(2) The FDIC considers affiliate lending subject to the following constraints:</P>
              <P>(i) No affiliate may claim a loan origination or loan purchase if another institution claims the same loan origination or purchase; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If a bank elects to have the FDIC consider loans within a particular lending category made by one or more of the bank's affiliates in a particular assessment area, the bank shall elect to have the FDIC consider, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all the loans within that lending category in that particular assessment area made by all of the bank's affiliates.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC does not consider affiliate lending in assessing a bank's performance under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Lending by a consortium or a third party.</E> Community development loans originated or purchased by a consortium in which the bank participates or by a third party in which the bank has invested:</P>
              <P>(1) Will be considered, at the bank's option, if the bank reports the data pertaining to these loans under § 345.42(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(2) May be allocated among participants or investors, as they choose, for purposes of the lending test, except that no participant or investor:</P>
              <P>(i) May claim a loan origination or loan purchase if another participant or investor claims the same loan origination or purchase; or</P>
              <P>(ii) May claim loans accounting for more than its percentage share (based on the level of its participation or investment) of the total loans originated by the consortium or third party.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Data reporting.</E> The FDIC's approval of a plan does not affect the bank's obligation, if any, to report data as required by § 345.42.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Plans in general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Term.</E> A plan may have a term of no more than five years, and any multi-year plan must include annual interim measurable goals under which the FDIC will evaluate the bank's performance.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Multiple assessment areas.</E> A bank with more than one assessment area may prepare a single plan for all of its assessment areas or one or more plans for one or more of its assessment areas.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Treatment of affiliates.</E> Affiliated institutions may prepare a joint plan if the plan provides measurable goals for each institution. Activities may be allocated among institutions at the institutions' option, provided that the same activities are not considered for more than one institution.</P>

              <P>(3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan available for review by the public at no cost at all offices of the bank in any assessment area covered by the plan and provide copies of the plan upon request for a reasonable fee to cover copying and mailing, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Submission of plan.</E> The bank shall submit its plan to the FDIC at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. The bank shall also submit with its plan a description of its informal efforts to seek suggestions from members of the public, any written public comment received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comment received, the initial plan as released for public comment.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Plan content</E>—(1) <E T="03">Measurable goals.</E> (i) A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each assessment area covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, through lending, investment, and services, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(ii) A bank shall address in its plan all three performance categories and, unless the bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its assessment area(s), considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Confidential information.</E> A bank may submit additional information to the FDIC on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan must be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the FDIC to judge the merits of the plan.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Satisfactory and outstanding goals.</E> A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute “satisfactory” performance. A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute “outstanding” performance. If a bank submits, and the FDIC approves, both “satisfactory” and “outstanding” performance goals, the FDIC will consider the bank eligible for an “outstanding” performance rating.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Election if satisfactory goals not substantially met.</E> A bank may elect in its plan that, if the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will evaluate the bank's performance under the lending, investment, and service tests, the community development test, or the <PRTPAGE P="637"/>small bank performance standards, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Plan approval</E>—(1) <E T="03">Timing.</E> The FDIC will act upon a plan within 60 calendar days after the FDIC receives the complete plan and other material required under paragraph (e) of this section. If the FDIC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless the FDIC extends the review period for good cause.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> In evaluating the plan's goals, the FDIC considers the public's involvement in formulating the plan, written public comment on the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Criteria for evaluating plan.</E> The FDIC evaluates a plan's measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address credit needs;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the bank's qualified investments; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The availability and effectiveness of the bank's systems for delivering retail banking services and the extent and innovativeness of the bank's community development services.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Plan amendment.</E> During the term of a plan, a bank may request the FDIC to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that there has been a material change in circumstances. The bank shall develop an amendment to a previously approved plan in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Ratings in general.</E> Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the FDIC assigns to a bank a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance” based on the bank's performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small bank performance standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lending, investment, and service tests.</E> The FDIC assigns a rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in accordance with the following principles:</P>
              <P>(1) A bank that receives an “outstanding” rating on the lending test receives an assigned rating of at least “satisfactory”;</P>
              <P>(2) A bank that receives an “outstanding” rating on both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at least “high satisfactory” on the lending test receives an assigned rating of “outstanding”; and</P>
              <P>(3) No bank may receive an assigned rating of “satisfactory” or higher unless it receives a rating of at least “low satisfactory” on the lending test.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.</E> (1) The FDIC's evaluation of a bank's CRA performance is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices in any geography by the bank or in any assessment area by any affiliate whose loans have been considered as part of the bank's lending performance. In connection with any type of lending activity described in § 345.22(a), evidence of discriminatory or other credit practices that violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation includes, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis in violation, for example, of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing Act;</P>
              <P>(ii) Violations of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act;</P>
              <P>(iii) Violations of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;</P>

              <P>(iv) Violations of section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; and<PRTPAGE P="638"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Violations of the Truth in Lending Act provisions regarding a consumer's right of rescission.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining the effect of evidence of practices described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on the bank's assigned rating, the FDIC considers the nature, extent, and strength of the evidence of the practices; the policies and procedures that the bank (or affiliate, as applicable) has in place to prevent the practices; any corrective action that the bank (or affiliate, as applicable) has taken or has committed to take, including voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment; and any other relevant information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assessment area delineation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A bank shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the FDIC evaluates the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The FDIC does not evaluate the bank's delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion, but the FDIC reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks.</E> The assessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose bank must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the bank has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Geographic area(s) for other banks.</E> The assessment area(s) for a bank other than a wholesale or limited purpose bank must:</P>
              <P>(1) Consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns; and</P>
              <P>(2) Include the geographies in which the bank has its main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking RSFs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the bank has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the bank chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the bank elects to have its performance assessed).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustments to geographic area(s).</E> A bank may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only <PRTPAGE P="639"/>the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an assessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area.</E> Each bank's assessment area(s):</P>
              <P>(1) Must consist only of whole geographies;</P>
              <P>(2) May not reflect illegal discrimination;</P>
              <P>(3) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account the bank's size and financial condition; and</P>
              <P>(4) May not extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or beyond a state boundary unless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA. If a bank serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond a state boundary, the bank shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas in each state. If a bank serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond an MSA boundary, the bank shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas inside and outside the MSA.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Banks serving military personnel.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a bank whose business predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or their dependents who are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate its entire deposit customer base as its assessment area.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of assessment area(s).</E> The FDIC uses the assessment area(s) delineated by a bank in its evaluation of the bank's CRA performance unless the FDIC determines that the assessment area(s) do not comply with the requirements of this section.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Small banks electing evaluation under the lending, investment, and service tests.</E> A bank that qualifies for evaluation under the small bank performance standards but elects evaluation under the lending, investment, and service tests shall collect, maintain, and report the data required for other banks pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Ratings in general.</E> (1) In assigning a rating, the FDIC evaluates a bank's performance under the applicable performance criteria in this part, in accordance with §§ 345.21 and 345.28. This includes consideration of low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers and activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions, as well as adjustments on the basis of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.</P>
              <P>(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance in others. The bank's overall performance, however, must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and generally with the appropriate rating profile as follows.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Strategic plan assessment and rating</E>—(1) <E T="03">Satisfactory goals.</E> The FDIC approves as “satisfactory” measurable goals that adequately help to meet the credit needs of the bank's assessment area(s).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Outstanding goals.</E> If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as “satisfactory,” the FDIC will approve those goals as “outstanding.”</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Rating.</E> The FDIC assesses the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals:</P>
              <P>(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will rate the bank's performance under the plan as “satisfactory.”</P>
              <P>(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the FDIC will rate the bank's performance under the plan as “outstanding.”</P>
              <P>(iii) If the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will rate the bank as either “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance,” depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, unless the bank elected in its plan to be rated otherwise, as provided in § 345.27(f)(4).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope of this part.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This part implements section 711 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1831y). That section requires any nongovernmental entity or person, insured depository institution, or affiliate of an insured depository institution that enters into a covered agreement to—</P>

            <P>(2) Subsidiaries of state nonmember insured banks;</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 346.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definition of covered agreement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General definition of covered agreement.</E> A covered agreement is any contract, arrangement, or understanding that meets all of the following criteria—</P>
            <P>(1) The agreement is in writing.</P>
            <P>(2) The parties to the agreement include—</P>
            <P>(i) One or more insured depository institutions or affiliates of an insured depository institution; and</P>
            <P>(ii) One or more nongovernmental entities or persons (referred to hereafter as NGEPs).</P>
            <P>(3) The agreement provides for the insured depository institution or any affiliate to—</P>
            <P>(i) Provide to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) cash payments, grants, or other consideration (except loans) that have an aggregate value of more than $10,000 in any calendar year; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Make to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) loans that have an aggregate principal amount of more than $50,000 in any calendar year.</P>

            <P>(4) The agreement is made pursuant to, or in connection with, the fulfillment of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (CRA), as defined in§ 346.4.</P>
            <P>(5) The agreement is with a NGEP that has had a CRA communication as described in § 346.3 prior to entering into the agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Examples concerning written arrangements or understandings</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to make more community development investments in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and insured depository institution do not reach an agreement concerning the community development investments the institution should make in the community, and the parties do not reach any mutual arrangement or understanding. Two weeks later, the institution unilaterally issues a press release announcing that it has established a general goal of making $100 million of community development grants in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods served by the insured depository institution over the next 5 years. The NGEP is not identified in the press release. The press release is not a written arrangement or understanding.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to offer new loan programs in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and the insured depository institution reach a mutual arrangement or understanding that the institution will provide additional loans in the NGEP's community. The institution tells the NGEP that it will issue a press release announcing the program. Later, the insured depository institution issues a press release announcing the loan program. The press release incorporates the key terms of the understanding reached between the NGEP and the insured depository institution. The written press release reflects the mutual arrangement or understanding of the NGEP and the insured depository institution and is, therefore, a written arrangement or understanding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> An NGEP sends a letter to an insured depository institution requesting that the institution provide a $15,000 grant to the NGEP. The insured depository institution responds in writing and agrees to provide the grant in connection with its annual grant program. The exchange of letters constitutes a written arrangement or understanding.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Loan agreements that are not covered agreements.</E> A covered agreement does not include—</P>

            <P>(1) Any individual loan that is secured by real estate; or<PRTPAGE P="650"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Any specific contract or commitment for a loan or extension of credit to an individual, business, farm, or other entity, or group of such individuals or entities if—</P>
            <P>(i) The funds are loaned at rates that are not substantially below market rates; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The loan application or other loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to use the borrowed funds to make a loan or extension of credit to one or more third parties.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples concerning loan agreements</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> An insured depository institution provides an organization with a $1 million loan that is documented in writing and is secured by real estate owned or to-be-acquired by the organization. The agreement is an individual mortgage loan and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, regardless of the interest rate on the loan or whether the organization intends or is authorized to re-loan the funds to a third party.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> An insured depository institution commits to provide a $500,000 line of credit to a small business that is documented by a written agreement. The loan is made at rates that are within the range of rates offered by the institution to similarly situated small businesses in the market and the loan documentation does not indicate that the small business intends or is authorized to re-lend the borrowed funds. The agreement is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> An insured depository institution offers small business loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). A small business obtains a $75,000 loan, documented in writing, from the institution under the institution's SBA loan program. The loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to re-lend the funds. Although the rate charged on the loan is well below that charged by the institution on commercial loans, the rate is within the range of rates that the institution would charge a similarly situated small business for a similar loan under the SBA loan program. Accordingly, the loan is not made at substantially below market rates and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> A bank holding company enters into a written agreement with a community development organization that provides that insured depository institutions owned by the bank holding company will make $250 million in small business loans in the community over the next 5 years. The written agreement is not a specific contract or commitment for a loan or an extension of credit and, thus, is not exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section: Each small business loan made by the insured depository institution pursuant to this general commitment would, however, be exempt from coverage if the loan is made at rates that are not substantially below market rates and the loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intended or was authorized to re-lend the funds.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements that include exempt loan agreements.</E> If an agreement includes a loan, extension of credit or loan commitment that, if documented separately, would be exempt under paragraph (c) of this section, the exempt loan, extension of credit or loan commitment may be excluded for purposes of determining whether the agreement is a covered agreement.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Determining annual value of agreements that lack schedule of disbursements.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a multi-year agreement that does not include a schedule for the disbursement of payments, grants, loans or other consideration by the insured depository institution or affiliate, is considered to have a value in the first year of the agreement equal to all payments, grants, loans and other consideration to be provided at any time under the agreement.</P>

            <P>(B) An employee designated with responsibility for compliance with the CRA or executive officer if the employee or executive officer knows that the institution or affiliate is negotiating, intends to negotiate, or has been informed by the NGEP that it expects to request that the institution or affiliate negotiate an agreement with the NGEP.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Other communications.</E> An insured depository institution or affiliate is deemed to have knowledge of—</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Communication where NGEP has knowledge.</E> A NGEP has a CRA communication with an insured depository institution or affiliate only if any of the <PRTPAGE P="652"/>following individuals has knowledge of the communication—</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Examples of CRA communications</E>—(1) <E T="03">Examples of actions that are CRA communications.</E> The following are examples of CRA communications. These examples are not exclusive and assume that the communication occurs within the relevant time period as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section and the appropriate representatives have knowledge of the communication as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A NGEP files a written comment with a Federal banking agency that states than an insured depository institution successfully addresses the credit needs of its community. The written comment is in response to a general request from the agency for comments on an application of the insured depository institution to open a new branch and a copy of the comment is provided to the institution.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples 2.</E> A NGEP meets with an executive officer of an insured depository institution and states that the institution must improve its CRA performance.</P>

Two weeks later, the NGEP meets with an executive officer of the bank holding company to discuss the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the target insured depository institution. The insured depository institution was an affiliate of the bank holding company at the time the NGEP met with the target institution. (See § 346.11(a).)

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A NGEP receives an unrestricted grant of $15,000 under a covered agreement, includes the funds in its general operating budget, and uses the funds during its fiscal year. The NGEP's annual report for the fiscal year must provide the name and mailing address of the NGEP, information sufficient to identify the covered agreement, and state that the NGEP received $15,000 during the fiscal year. The report must also indicate the total expenditures made by the NGEP during the fiscal year for compensation, administrative expenses, travel expenses, <PRTPAGE P="657"/>entertainment expenses, consulting and professional fees, and other expenses and uses. The NGEP's annual report may provide this information by submitting an Internal Revenue Service Form 990 that includes the required information. If the Internal Revenue Service Form does not include information for all of the required categories listed in this part, the NGEP must report the total expenditures in the remaining categories either by providing that information directly or by providing another form or report that includes the required information.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples 2.</E> An organization receives $15,000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement and allocates and uses the $15,000 during the fiscal year to purchase computer equipment to support its functions. The organization's annual report must include the name and address of the organization, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the organization received $15,000 during the year. In addition, since the organization allocated and used the funds for a specific purpose that is more narrow and limited than the categories of expenses included in the detailed, itemized list of expenses, the organization would have the option of providing either the total amount it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, or a statement that it used the $15,000 to purchase computer equipment and a brief description of the equipment purchased.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Examples 3.</E> A community group receives $50,000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement. During its fiscal year, the community group specifically allocates and uses $5,000 of the funds to pay for a particular business trip and uses the remaining $45,000 for general operating expenses. The group's annual report for the fiscal year must include the name and address of the group, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the group received $50,000. Because the group did not allocate and use all of the funds for a specific purpose, the group's annual report must provide the total amount of funds it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. The group's annual report also could state that it used $5,000 for a particular business trip and include a brief description of the trip.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> A community development organization is a party to two separate covered agreements with two unaffiliated insured depository institutions. Under each agreement, the organization receives $15,000 during its fiscal year and uses the funds to support its activities during that year. If the organization elects to file a consolidated annual report, the consolidated report must identify the organization and the two covered agreements, state that the organization received $15,000 during the fiscal year under each agreement, and provide the total amount that the organization used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
