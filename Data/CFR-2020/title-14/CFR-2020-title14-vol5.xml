      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>

        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(a) In establishing a civilian space program, the Congress required NASA to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof,” and for the withholding from public inspection of that information that is classified to protect the national security.</P>

            <P>(b) The Order was promulgated in recognition of the essential requirement for an informed public concerning the activities of its Government, as well as the need to protect certain national security information from unauthorized disclosure. It delegates to NASA certain responsibility for matters pertaining to national security and confers on the Administrator of NASA, or such responsible officers or employees as the Administrator may designate, the authority for original classification of official information or material which requires protection in the interest of national security.

During this process, the data are withheld through administrative measures, and it is not necessary to resort to security classification to prevent premature release.

If NASA does not support the proposal but believes that security classification would be appropriate under the criteria of § 1203.400 if it were under Government jurisdiction, the contractor should be advised of the reasons why safeguarding would be appropriate, unless security considerations preclude release of the explanation to the contractor. NASA should identify the Government department, agency or activity whose national security interests might be involved and the contractor should be instructed to protect the proposal as though classified pending further advisory classification opinion by the Government activity whose interests are involved. If such a Government activity cannot be identified, the contractor should be advised that the proposal is not under NASA jurisdiction for classification purposes, and that the information should be sent, under proper safeguards, to the <PRTPAGE P="12"/>Director, Information Security Oversight Office for a determination.</P>

            <P>(a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall establish a specific date or event for declassification based on the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified.

            <SUBJECT>Systematic review for declassification:</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) NASA must establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review of NASA-originated records of permanent historical value exempted from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of this Order. The NASA Office of Protective Services shall prioritize the review of <PRTPAGE P="16"/>such records in coordination with the Center Protective Service Offices.</P>
            <P>(2) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification review program for classified records:</P>
            <P>(i) Accessioned into the National Archives;</P>
            <P>(ii) Transferred to the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and</P>
            <P>(iii) For which the National Archives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.</P>
            <P>(3) The Chairperson, NISPC, shall designate experienced personnel to assist the Archivist in the systematic review of U.S. originated information and foreign information exempted from automated declassification. Such personnel shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Provide guidance and assistance to the National Archives and Records Service in identifying and separating documents and specific categories of information within documents which are deemed to require continued classification; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Develop reports of information or document categories so separated, with recommendations concerning continued classification.</P>
            <P>(iii) Develop, in coordination with NASA organizational elements, guidelines for the systematic review for declassification of classified information under NASA's jurisdiction. The guidelines shall state specific limited categories of information which, because of their national security sensitivity, should not be declassified automatically, but should be reviewed to determine whether continued protection beyond 25 years is needed. These guidelines are authorized for use by the Archivist and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, with the approval of the Senior Agency Official, which is the Assistant Administrator, Office of Protective Services, for categories listed in section 3.3 of the Order. These guidelines shall be reviewed at least every five years and revised as necessary, unless an earlier review for revision is requested by the Archivist. Copies of the declassification guidelines promulgated by NASA will be provided to the Information Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). All security classified records exempt from automatic declassification, whether held in storage areas under installation control or in Federal Records Centers, will be surveyed to identify those requiring scheduling for future disposition.</P>
            <P>(A) Classified information or material over which NASA exercises exclusive or final original classification authority and which is to be declassified in accordance with the systematic review guidelines shall be so marked.</P>
            <P>(B) Classified information or material over which NASA exercises exclusive or final original classification authority and which, in accordance with the systematic review guidelines is to be kept protected, shall be listed by category by the responsible custodian and referred to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee. This listing shall:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identify the information or material involved.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Recommend classification beyond 25 years to a specific event scheduled to happen or a specific period of time in accordance with the Order.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The Administrator shall delegate to the Senior Agency Official the authority to determine which category shall be kept classified and the dates or event for declassification.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Declassification by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office (DISOO). If the Director determines that NASA information is classified in violation of the Order, the Director may require the information to be declassified. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed through the NASA ISPC to the National Security Council. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.</P>

            <P>(1) The request for a review describes the document or material containing <PRTPAGE P="17"/>the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate it in a reasonably timely manner;</P>
            <P>(2) The document or material containing the information responsive to the request is not contained within an operational file exempted from search and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance with law; and</P>
            <P>(3) The information is not the subject of pending litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Presidential papers.</E> Information originated by the President or Vice President; the President's White House Staff, or the Vice President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the President; or other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the President are exempted from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the Archivist shall have the authority to review, downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former Presidents and Vice Presidents under the control of the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2111 note, or 2203. Procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a decision on the appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Submission of requests for review.</E> Requests for mandatory review of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Requests originating within NASA shall, in all cases, be submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services.</P>
            <P>(2) For the most expeditious action, requests from other Governmental agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services only. The requestor may submit the request to: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Central Registry, 300 E Street SW., Washington DC 20546, Attention: Office of Protective Services/Information Security Program Manager. The phrase, “Mandatory Declassification Review,” must be stated in the request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirement for processing.</E> (1) Requests which are submitted under the Freedom of Information Act cannot be processed under the MDR process.</P>
            <P>(2) The request describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity, such as accession numbers, box titles or numbers, date and title of document, in any combination, to enable NASA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort, not to exceed 30 days. If more time is required, NASA will notify the requester. After review, the information or any portion thereof that no longer requires protection shall be declassified and released unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Processing of requests.</E> Requests that meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be processed as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The NASA Office of Protective Services review upon receiving the initial request shall be completed within 365 days.</P>
            <P>(2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged promptly. The NASA Office of Protective Services shall determine whether, under the declassification provisions of this part 1203, the requested information may be declassified and, if so, shall make such information available to the requestor, unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released in whole or in part, the requestor shall be given a brief statement of the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in order to be considered.</P>

            <P>(3) All appeals of denials of requests for declassification shall be acted upon and determined finally within 120 working days after receipt, and the requester shall be advised that the appeal <PRTPAGE P="18"/>determination is final. If the requester is dissatisfied with NASA's appeal decision, the requester may initiate an appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP), within the Information Security Oversight Office. If continued classification is required under the provisions of this part 1203, the requester shall be notified of the reasons thereof.</P>
            <P>(4) The declassification and release of foreign government information that is subjected to mandatory review under this section shall be determined only in accordance with § 1203.703.</P>
            <P>(5) When the NASA Office of Protective Services receives any request for declassification of information in documents in its custody that was classified by another Government agency, it shall refer copies of the request and the requested documents to the originating agency for processing and may, after consultation with the originating agency, inform the requester of the referral.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Neutral response.</E> In response to a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of “the Order,” NASA shall refuse to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself classifiable under “the Order.”</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Declassification of transferred documents or material</E>—(1) <E T="03">Material officially transferred.</E> In the case of classified information or material transferred by or pursuant to statute or Executive Order to NASA in conjunction with a transfer of functions (not merely for storage purposes) for NASA's use and as part of its official files or property, as distinguished from transfers merely for purposes of storage, NASA shall be deemed to be the original classifying authority over such material for purposes of downgrading and declassification.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Material not officially transferred.</E> When NASA has in its possession classified information or material originated by an agency which has since ceased to exist and that information has not been officially transferred to another department or agency or when it is impossible for NASA to identify the originating agency and a review of the material indicates that it should be downgraded or declassified, NASA shall be deemed to be the originating agency for the purpose of declassifying or downgrading such material. NASA will consult with the Information Security Oversight Office to assist in final disposition of the information.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Transfer for storage or retirement.</E> (i) Insofar as practicable, classified documents shall be reviewed to determine whether or not they can be downgraded or declassified prior to being forwarded to records centers or to the National Archives for storage. Any downgrading or declassification determination shall be indicated on each document by appropriate markings.</P>
            <P>(ii) Classified information transferred to the General Services Administration for accession into the Archives of the United States shall be downgraded or declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with “the Order,” the directives of the Information Security Oversight Office, GSA, and NASA guidelines.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Downgrading and declassification actions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification of changes in classification or declassification.</E> When classified material has been marked with specific dates or events for downgrading or declassification, it is not necessary to issue notices of such actions to any holders. However, when such actions are taken earlier than originally scheduled, or the duration of classification is shortened, the authority making such changes shall, to the extent practicable, ensure prompt notification to all addressees to whom the information or material was originally transmitted. The notification shall specify the marking action to be taken, the authority therefor, and the effective date. Upon receipt of notification, recipients shall effect the proper changes and shall notify addressees to whom they have transmitted the classified information or material.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Posted notice.</E> If prompt remarking of large quantities would be unduly burdensome, the custodian may attach declassification, downgrading, or upgrading notices to the storage unit in lieu of the remarking action otherwise required. Each notice shall indicate the change, the authority for the action, the date of the action, and the storage <PRTPAGE P="19"/>units to which it applies. Items withdrawn from such storage units shall be promptly remarked. However, when information subject to a posted downgrading or declassification notice is withdrawn from one storage unit solely for transfer to another, or a storage unit containing such information is transferred from one place to another, the transfer may be made without remarking if the notice is attached to or remains with each shipment.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Foreign Relations Series.</E> In order to permit the State Department editors of <E T="03">Foreign Relations of the United States</E> to meet their mandated goal of publishing 20 years after the event, NASA shall assist these editors by facilitating access to appropriate classified materials in its custody and by expediting declassification review of items from its files selected for publication.</P>

          <P>For the purpose of this part, the following definitions apply:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Security area.</E> A physically defined area, established for the protection or security of facilities, property, or classfied/proprietary information and material in the possession of NASA or a NASA contractor located at a NASA Center or Component Facility, entry to which is subject to security measures, procedures, or controls. Security areas which may be established are:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Controlled area.</E> An area in which security measures are taken to safeguard and control access to property and hazardous materials or other sensitive material or to protect operations that are vital to the accomplishment of the mission assigned to a Center or Component Facility. The controlled area shall have a clearly defined perimeter, but permanent physical barriers are not required.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Limited area.</E> An area in which security measures are taken to safeguard or control access to classified material or unclassified property warranting special protection or property and hazardous materials or to protect operations that are vital to the accomplishment of the mission assigned to a Center or Component Facility. A Limited Area shall also have a clearly defined perimeter, but differs from a Controlled Area in that permanent physical barriers and access control devices, including walls and doors with locks or access devices, are emplaced to assist the occupants in keeping out unauthorized personnel. All facilities <PRTPAGE P="22"/>designated as NASA Critical Infrastructure or a key resource will be designated at a minimum as “Limited” areas.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Exclusion area.</E> An area that is a permanent facility dedicated solely to the safeguarding and use of Classified National Security Information. It is used when vaults are unsuitable or impractical and where entry to the area alone provides visible or audible access to classified material. To prevent unauthorized access to an exclusion area, visitors will be escorted or other internal restrictions implemented, as determined by the Center Security Office.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary security area.</E> A designated interim security area, the need for which will not exceed 30 days from date of establishment. A temporary security area may also be established, pending approval of its establishment as a permanent security area.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Permanent security area.</E> A designated security area, the need for which will exceed 30 days from date of establishment.</P>

          <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) Specific purpose(s) for the establishment of a security area.</P>
          <P>(ii) For those areas currently designated by the Center as “permanent security areas,” the information set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section will be furnished to the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services , NASA Headquarters, within 30 workdays of the effective date of this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Maintenance.</E> The security measures which may be utilized to protect such areas will be determined by the requirements of individual situations. At a minimum, such security measures will:</P>
          <P>(1) Provide for the posting of signs at entrances and at such intervals along the perimeter of the designated area as to provide reasonable notice to persons about to enter thereon. The Assistant Administrator for Protective Services, NASA Headquarters, upon request, may approve the use of signs that are now being used pursuant to a State statute.</P>
          <P>(2) Regulate authorized personnel entry and movement within the area.</P>
          <P>(3) Deny entry of unauthorized persons or property.</P>
          <P>(4) Prevent unauthorized removal of classified information and material or property from a NASA Center or Component Facility.</P>

          <P>(a) NASA security force personnel may exercise arrest authority, provided that:</P>
          <P>(1) They have graduated from an accredited training course (see § 1203b.102(a)); and</P>
          <P>(2) They have been certified in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services, or designee, as specifically authorized to exercise arrest authority.</P>
          <P>(b) The authority of NASA security force personnel to make a warrantless arrest is subject to the following conditions:</P>
          <P>(1) The arresting officer must be guarding and protecting property owned or leased by, or under the control of, the United States under the administration and control of NASA or one of its contractors or subcontractors, at facilities owned by or contracted to NASA; and</P>
          <P>(2) The person to be arrested has committed in the arresting officer's presence an offense against the United States Government, NASA, or a NASA contractor; or</P>
          <P>(3) The arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States.</P>
          <P>(c) The Office of the General Counsel, NASA Headquarters, or the Center Chief Counsel's Office, as appropriate, shall provide guidance as to the applicability of these regulations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Exercise of arrest authority—general guidelines.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In making an arrest, the security force personnel should announce their authority and that the person is under arrest prior to taking the person into custody. If the circumstances are such that making such an announcement would be useless or dangerous to the security force personnel or others, the security force personnel may dispense with these announcements, but must subsequently identify themselves and their arrest authority to the arrested person(s) as soon as reasonably possible.</P>
          <P>(b) The security force personnel at the time and place of arrest may search the arrested person and the area immediately surrounding the arrested person for weapons and criminal evidence. This is to protect the arresting officer and to prevent the destruction of evidence.</P>
          <P>(c) Custody of the person arrested should be transferred to other Federal law enforcement personnel (e.g., United States Marshals or FBI agents) or to local law enforcement agency personnel, as appropriate, as soon as possible, in order to ensure the person is brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.</P>

          <P>When a security force personnel has the right to make an arrest, as discussed in § 1203b.103, the officer may use only that non-deadly physical force which is reasonable and necessary to apprehend and arrest the offender; to prevent the escape of the offender; or to defend himself/herself or a third person from what the security force officer reasonably believes to be the use or threat of imminent use of non-deadly physical force by the offender. Verbal abuse alone by the offender cannot be the basis under any circumstances for use of non-deadly physical force by a security force officer.</P>

          <P>NASA security force personnel may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.</P>
          <P>(a) Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.</P>
          <P>(b) Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles.</P>
          <P>(c) If feasible and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force.</P>
          <P>(d) Warning shots are not permitted outside of the prison context.</P>
          <P>(e) Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects which must be used when the use of deadly force is not authorized by this policy.</P>

          <P>(2) The officer shall be promptly suspended from duty with pay or reassigned to other duties not involving the use of a firearm, as the Center Director or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services deems appropriate, pending investigation of the incident.</P>
          <P>(3) The cognizant Center Director, or for incidents occurring at NASA Headquarters, the Executive Director for Headquarters Operations, shall appoint an investigating officer to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident. Additional personnel may also be appointed, as needed to assist the investigating officer. Upon conclusion of the investigation, the investigating officer shall submit a written report of findings and recommendations to the appropriate Installation Director or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services.</P>
          <P>(4) Upon conclusion of the investigation, the Center Director or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services, with the advice of Counsel, shall determine the disposition appropriate to the case.</P>

          <P>(d) Firearms will be periodically inspected and kept in good working order by a qualified gunsmith. Ammunition, holsters, and related equipment will be periodically inspected for deterioration and kept in good working order.

            <P>(a) It is NASA's policy to enable small businesses (including small disadvantaged businesses, small women-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses), historically black colleges and universities, and other minority educational institutions the opportunity to participate equitably and proportionately in its total purchases and contracts that are consistent with the Agency's needs to execute its mission.</P>
            <P>(b) In carrying out the NASA procurement program, the primary consideration shall be that of securing contract performance, including obtaining deliveries of required items or services at the time, in the quantity and of the quality prescribed. In the area of research and development (R&amp;D) contracts, the general policy of NASA is to award such contracts to those organizations determined by responsible personnel to have a high degree of competence in the specific branch of science or technology required for the successful conduct of the work. It is in the interest of the civilian space program that the number of firms engaged inR&amp;D, work for NASA be expanded and that there be an increase in the extent of participation in such work by competent small business firms.</P>

When a Center Director determines that the volume of acquisitions or the functions relating to acquisitions at the Center do not warrant a full-time small business specialist, these duties may be assigned to procurement personnel on a part-time basis, with the concurrence of the Associate Administrator for the Office of Small Business Programs. NASA Centers shall establish and maintain liaison with the Small Business Administration (SBA) Procurement Center Representative (PCR) or the appropriate SBA Regional Office in matters relating to NASA Center procurement activities.

Before the aircraft is permitted to depart, the approving authority will require full compliance with this subpart 1204.14, including the filing of a complete report explaining the reasons for the unauthorized landing. Violators could also be subject to legal liability for unauthorized use. When it appears that the violation of this subpart was deliberate or is a repeated violation, the matter will be referred to the Aircraft Management Office, NASA Headquarters, which will then grant any departure authorization.</P>

            <P>The items to be covered in Memoranda of Agreement between NASA Installations and state and areawide OMB Circular A-95 clearinghouses for coordinating NASA and civilian planning:</P>

            <P>1. Clearinghouses will be contacted at the earliest practicable point in project planning. Generally, this will be during the preparation of Preliminary Engineering Reports, or possibly earlier if meaningful information is available that could practically serve as an input in the decision-making process. It <PRTPAGE P="44"/>should be noted that clearinghouses are generally comprehensive planning agencies. As such, they are often the best repositories of information required for development planning and constitute a resource that can often save Federal planners substantial time and effort, if consulted early enough. In addition to providing information necessary for preliminary engineering, clearinghouses can make useful inputs to the development of environmental impact statements, as well as in reviewing draft statements. Thus, consultation at the earliest stage in planning can have substantial payoffs in installation development.</P>
            <P>2. Clearinghouses will be afforded a minimum time of 30 days in which to review and comment on a proposed project and a maximum time of 45 days in which to complete such review.</P>
            <P>3. The minimum information to be provided to the clearinghouse will consist of project description, scope and purpose, summary technical data, maps and diagrams where relevant, and any data which would show the relationship of the proposed project or action to applicable land use plans, policies, and controls for the affected area.</P>
            <P>4. Establish procedures for notifying clearinghouses of the actions taken on projects, such as implementation, timing, postponement, abandonment, and explaining, where appropriate, actions taken contrary to clearinghouse recommendations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part 1206 establishes the policies, responsibilities, and procedures for the release of Agency records which are under the jurisdiction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, hereinafter NASA, to members of the public. This part applies to information and Agency records located at NASA Headquarters, and NASA Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers, herein NASA Headquarters and Centers, as defined in this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended 5 U.S.C. 552, a positive and continuing obligation exists for NASA, herein Agency, to make available to the fullest extent practicable upon request by members of the public, all Agency records under its jurisdiction, as described in this regulation.</P>
            <P>(b) Part 1206 does not entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any record that is not required under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(c) The disclosure of exempt records, without authorization by the appropriate NASA official, is not an official release of information; accordingly, it is not a FOIA release. Such a release does not waive the authority of NASA to assert FOIA exemptions to withhold the same records in response to a FOIA request. In addition, while the authority may exist to disclose records to individuals in their official capacity, the provisions of this part apply if the same individual seeks the records in a private or personal capacity.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency opinions, orders, statements, and manuals.</E> (1) Unless they are exempt from disclosure in accordance with the FOIA, or unless they are promptly published and copies offered for sale, NASA shall make available the following records for public inspection in an electronic format or purchase:</P>
            <P>(i) All final opinions (including concurring and dissenting opinions) and all orders made in the adjudication of cases;</P>

            <P>(ii) Those statements of NASA policy and interpretations which have been adopted by NASA and are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
            <P>(iii) Administrative staff manuals (or similar issuances) and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</P>
            <P>(iv) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have been released to any person under Subpart C of this part and that, because of the nature of their subject matter, the Agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records (frequently requested documents or documents that have been requested 3 or more times).</P>

            </P>
            <P>(i) For records created after November 1, 1996, which are covered by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, such records shall be available electronically, through an electronic library and in electronic forms or formats.</P>
            <P>(ii) In connection with all records required to be made available or published under this paragraph (b), identifying details shall be deleted to the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. However, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing. The extent of such deletion shall be indicated on the portion of the record which is made available or published, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption in the FOIA. If technically feasible, the extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is made.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other Agency records.</E> (1) In addition to the records made available or published under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, NASA shall, upon request for other records made in accordance with this part, make such records promptly available to any person, unless they are exempt from disclosure, or unless they may be purchased by the public from other readily available sources, i.e., books.</P>
            <P>(2) Furthermore, at a minimum, NASA will maintain records in its electronic library that were created after November 1, 1996, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section and a guide for requesting records or information from NASA.</P>

            <P>Publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> is a means of making certain Agency records are available to the public in accordance with 5 U.S.C.552(a)(2) without requiring the filing of a FOIA request. NASA has a FOIA Electronic Library Web site at NASA Headquarters and each of its Centers. The FedBizOpps (FBO) (formerly Commerce Business Daily), is also a source of information concerning Agency records or actions. Various other NASA publications and documents, and indexes thereto, are available from other sources, such as the U.S. Superintendent of Documents and the Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (Department of the Interior). Such publications and documents are not required to be made available or reproduced in response to a request unless they cannot be purchased readily from available sources.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1206.300</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How to make a request for Agency records.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A requester submitting a request for records must include his/her name, and an email or mailing address in order for the Agency to be able to send responsive records and/or to be able to contact the requester to obtain additional information or clarification of the request sought (see § 1206.301). The request must also address fees or provide justification for a fee waiver (see <PRTPAGE P="47"/>§ 1206.302) as well as address the fee category in accordance with § 1206.507. The request should also include a telephone number in case the FOIA office needs to contact the requester regarding the request; however, this information is optional when submitting a request if an email or mailing address is provided. A requester may also submit a request online via the NASA FOIA website, <E T="03">https://www.nasa.gov/FOIA/Contacts.html.</E> Do not include a social security number on any correspondence with the FOIA office. If the FOIA unit determines processing fees will exceed the fee category entitlement, the unit will require a personal mailing address for billing purposes or for commercial use requesters, a business mailing address.</P>

            <P>(b) NASA does not have a central location for submitting FOIA requests and it does not maintain a central index or database of records in its possession. Instead, Agency records are decentralized and maintained by various Centers and offices throughout the country. All NASA Centers have the capability to receive requests electronically, either through email or a Web portal. To make a request for any of the NASA Center records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA office of the Center that maintains the records being sought. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the FOIA office of the Center that maintains the records requested. If a requester does not know which Center(s) may have the requested records, he/she may send his/her request(s) to the NASA's Headquarters (HQ) FOIA Public Liaison, 300 E Street SW, Room 5L19, Washington, DC 20546, Fax number: (202) 358-4332, email address: <E T="03">hq-foia@nasa.gov,</E> and the HQ FOIA unit will forward the request to the Center(s) that it determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.</P>
            <P>(c) NASA has not yet implemented a records management application for automated capture and control of e-records; therefore, official files are primarily paper files.</P>
            <P>(d) A member of the public may submit a FOIA request for an Agency record by mail, facsimile (FAX), electronic mail (email), or by submitting a written request in person to the FOIA office having responsibility over the record requested or to the NASA Headquarters (HQ) FOIA Office. A requester may also submit a request online via the NASA FOIA website.</P>
            <P>(e) When a requester is unable to determine the proper NASA FOIA Office to direct a request to, the requester may send the request to the NASA HQ FOIA Office, 300 E. Street SW., Washington, DC 20546-0001. The HQ FOIA Office will forward the request to the Center(s) that it determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.</P>

            <P>(1) For locations, mailing/email addresses of NASA FOIA Centers, visit our website at <E T="03">https://www.nasa.gov/FOIA/Contacts.html.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A misdirected request may take up to ten (10) additional working (meaning all days except Saturdays, Sundays and all Federal legal holidays) days to reroute to the proper FOIA office.</P>
            <P>(f) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself (a Privacy Act request) must comply with the verification of identity provisions set forth in 14 CFR 1212.202.</P>
            <P>(g) Where a request pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by the individual who is the subject of the record requested, or a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or submit proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or a verifiable obituary).</P>

            <P>(h) As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each Center FOIA office may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary, i.e., a notarized statement from the subject of the file, in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to a third party disclosure. Information will only be released on a case-by-case basis to third party requesters if they have independently <PRTPAGE P="48"/>provided authorization from the individual who is the subject of the request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Describing records sought.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In view of the time limits under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) for an initial determination on a request for an Agency record, a request must meet the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(a) The request must be addressed to an appropriate FOIA office or otherwise be clearly identified in the letter as a request for an Agency record under the “Freedom of Information Act.”</P>
            <P>(b) Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Agency personnel who are familiar with the subject area of the request to identify and locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a FOIA office in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought.</P>
            <P>(c) If NASA, after receiving a request, determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the NASA's designated FOIA contact or the Principal Agency FOIA Officer, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Agency's response to the request may be delayed or NASA may at its discretion close the request administratively.</P>
            <P>(d) Requests for clarification or more information will be made in writing (either via U.S. mail or electronic mail whenever possible). Requesters may respond by U.S. mail or by electronic mail regardless of the method used by NASA to transmit the request for additional information. In order to be considered timely, responses to requests for additional information must be postmarked or received by electronic mail within twenty (20) working days of the postmark date or date of the electronic mail request for additional information or received by electronic mail by 11:59:59 p.m. ET on the 20th working day. If the requester does not respond to a request for additional information within the 20 working days, the request may be administratively closed at NASA's discretion. This administrative closure does not prejudice the requester's ability to submit a new request for further consideration with additional information.</P>
            <P>(e) NASA need not comply with a blanket or categorical request (such as “all matters relating to” a general subject) where it is not reasonably feasible to determine what record is sought.</P>
            <P>(f) NASA will in good faith attempt to identify and locate the record(s) sought and will consult with the requester when necessary and appropriate for that purpose in accordance with these regulations.</P>
            <P>(g) NASA is not required to create or compile records in response to a FOIA request.</P>

            <P>(a) A request must explicitly state a willingness to pay all fees associated with processing the request, fees up to a specified amount, or a request for a fee waiver, if processing fees will likely exceed the statutory entitlements as defined in § 1206.507(b) and (c).</P>
            <P>(b) If the FOIA office determines that fees for processing the request will exceed the agreed upon amount or the statutory entitlements, the FOIA office will notify the requester that:</P>
            <P>(1) He/she must provide assurance of payment for all anticipated fees or provide an advance payment if estimated fees are expected to exceed $250.00, or</P>

            </P>
            <P>(3) He/she may wish to limit the scope of the request to reduce the processing fees.</P>
            <P>(c) If the FOIA office does not receive a written response within 20 working days after requesting the information, it will presume the requester is no longer interested in the records requested and will administratively close the request without further notification.</P>
            <P>(d) A commercial-use requester (as defined in§ 1206.507(c)(1)) must:</P>
            <P>(1) State a willingness to pay all fess associated with processing a request; or</P>
            <P>(2) State a willingness to pay fees to cover the costs of conducting an initial search for responsive records to determine a fee estimate.</P>
            <P>(e) If a requester is only willing to pay a limited amount for processing a request and it is for more than one document, the requester must state the order in which he/she would like the request for records to be processed.</P>
            <P>(f) If a requester is seeking a fee waiver, the request must include sufficient justification to substantiate a waiver. (See subpart E of this part for information on fee waivers.) Failure to provide sufficient justification will result in a denial of the fee waiver request.</P>
            <P>(g) If a requester is seeking a fee waiver, he/she may also choose to state a willingness to pay fees in case the fee waiver request is denied in order to allow the FOIA office to begin processing the request while considering the fee waiver.</P>
            <P>(h) If a fee is chargeable for search, review, duplication, or other costs incurred in connection with a request for an Agency record, the requester will be billed prior to releasing Agency documents. If the total amount of processing fees is under $50.00, the Agency will release the records when final processing is complete.</P>
            <P>(1) If the exact amount of the fee chargeable is not known at the time of the request, the requester will be notified in the initial determination (or in a final determination in the case of an appeal) of the amount of fees chargeable.</P>
            <P>(2) For circumstances in which advance payment of fees is required, the requester will be notified after the FOIA office has obtained an estimate of associated fees.</P>
            <P>(i) The FOIA office will begin processing a request only after the request has been properly described in accordance with these regulations and fees have been resolved.</P>
            <P>(j) If the requester is required to pay a fee and it is later determined on appeal that he/she was entitled to a full or partial fee waiver, a refund will be sent as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(k) NASA may refuse to consider a waiver or reduction of fees for requesters (persons or organizations) from whom unpaid fees remain owed to the Agency for another information access request.</P>

            <P>(a) Except in the instances described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, the FOIA office that first receives a request for a record and maintains that record is the FOIA office responsible <PRTPAGE P="50"/>for responding to the request. The office shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than ten (10) working days to process. The NASA office responding to the request shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining what records are responsive to a request, a FOIA office ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the FOIA office shall inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(c) A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1)-(3), shall not be considered responsive to a request.</P>
            <P>(d) The Head of a Center, or designee, is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by that Center.</P>
            <P>(e) The FOIA office may refer a request to or consult with another Center FOIA office or Federal agency in accordance with § 1206.308, if the FOIA office receives a request for records that are in its possession that were not created at that Center. If another Center within NASA or another Federal agency has substantial interest in or created the records, the request will either be referred or they will consult with that FOIA office/agency.</P>
            <P>(f) If a request for an Agency record is received by a FOIA office not having responsibility of the record (for example, when a request is submitted to one NASA Center or Headquarters and another NASA Center has responsibility of the record), the FOIA office receiving the request shall promptly forward it to that FOIA office within 10 working days from the date of receipt. The receiving FOIA office shall acknowledge the request and provide the requester with a tracking number.</P>

            <P>NASA shall withhold records only when it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law.</P>
            <P>(a) If the FOIA office denies records in response to a request either in full or in part, it will advise the requester in writing that:</P>
            <P>(1) The requested record(s) is exempt in full or in part; or</P>
            <P>(2) Records do not exist, cannot be located, are not in the Agency's control, or the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; or</P>
            <P>(3) A record is not readily reproducible in the form or format requested; and or</P>
            <P>(4) Denial is based on a procedural issue only and not access to the underlying records when it makes a decision that:</P>
            <P>(i) A fee waiver or another fee-related issue will not be granted; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Expedited processing will not be provided.</P>
            <P>(b) The denial notification must include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name, title, or position of the person(s) responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including a reference to any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the FOIA office to withhold records in full or in part;</P>

            <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, i.e., <PRTPAGE P="51"/>the number of pages or a reasonable form of estimation, unless such an estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) used to withhold the records or information; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart G of this part and a description of the requirements set forth therein. NASA shall also inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance and include a statement notifying the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). Should the requester elect to mediate any dispute related to the FOIA request with OGIS, NASA will participate in the mediation process in good faith.</P>
            <P>(c) If the requested records contain both exempt and non-exempt material, the FOIA office will:</P>
            <P>(1) Segregate and release the non-exempt material unless the non-exempt material is so intertwined with the exempt material that disclosure of it would leave only meaningless words and phrases;</P>
            <P>(2) Indicate on the released portion(s) of the records the amount of information redacted and the FOIA exemption(s) under which the redaction was made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the FOIA exemption used to withhold the information; and</P>
            <P>(3) If technically feasible, place the exemption at the place of excision.</P>

            <P>(a) Referrals and consultations can occur within the Agency or outside the Agency.</P>
            <P>(b) If a FOIA office (other than the Office of Inspector General) receives a request for records in its possession that another NASA FOIA office has responsibility over or is substantially concerned with, it will either:</P>
            <P>(1) Consult with the other FOIA office before deciding whether to release or withhold the records; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the request, along with the records, to that FOIA office for direct response.</P>
            <P>(c) If the FOIA office that originally received the request refers all or part of the request to another FOIA office within the Agency for further processing, they will notify the requester of the partial referral and provide that FOIA contact information.</P>
            <P>(d) If while responding to a request, the FOIA office locates records that originated with another Federal agency, it will generally refer the request and any responsive records to that other agency for a release determination and direct response.</P>
            <P>(e) If the FOIA office refers all the records to another agency, it will document the referral and maintain a copy of the records that it refers; notify the requester of the referral in writing, unless that identification will itself disclose a sensitive, exempt fact; and will provide the contact information for the other agency and if known, the name of a contact at the other agency.</P>
            <P>(f) If the FOIA office locates records that originated with another Federal agency while responding to a request, the office will make the release determination itself (after consulting with the originating agency) when:</P>
            <P>(1) The record is of primary interest to NASA (for example, a record may be of primary interest to NASA if it was developed or prepared according to Agency regulations or directives, or in response to an Agency request); or</P>
            <P>(2) NASA is in a better position than the originating agency to assess whether the record is exempt from disclosure; or</P>
            <P>(3) The originating agency is not subject to the FOIA; or</P>
            <P>(4) It is more efficient or practical depending on the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(g) If the FOIA office receives a request for records that another Federal agency has classified under any applicable executive order concerning record classification, it must refer the request to that agency for response.</P>

            <P>(h) If the FOIA office receives a request for records that are under the purview of another Federal agency, the office will return the request to the requester and may advise the requester <PRTPAGE P="52"/>to submit it directly to another agency. The FOIA office will then close the request.</P>
            <P>(i) All consultations and referrals received by the Agency will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was received by the first FOIA office.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for processing queues and expedited processing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The FOIA office will normally process requests in the order in which they are received in each of the processing tracks.</P>
            <P>(b) FOIA offices use three queues for multi-track processing depending on the complexity of the request. Once it has been determined the request meets the criteria in accordance with subpart C of this part, the FOIA office will place the request in one of the following tracks:</P>
            <P>(1) Simple—A request that can be processed within 20 working days.</P>
            <P>(2) Complex—A request that will take over 20 working days to process. (A complex request will generally require coordination with more than one office and a legal 10 working day extension for unusual circumstances (see § 1206.403) may be taken either up front or during the first 20 days of processing the request.)</P>
            <P>(3) Expedited processing—A request for expedited processing will be processed in this track if the requester can show exceptional need or urgency that their request should be processed out of turn in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
            <P>(2) Circumstances in which there is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity if the FOIA request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
            <P>(i) In most situations, a person primarily engaged in disseminating information will be a representative of the news media and therefore, will qualify as a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
            <P>(ii) To substantiate paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requested information must be the type of information which has particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly; this ordinarily refers to a breaking news story of general public interest. Information of historical interest only or information sought for litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media deadline unrelated to breaking news; or</P>
            <P>(3) The loss of substantial due process rights.</P>
            <P>(d) A request for expedited processing must contain a statement that:</P>
            <P>(1) Explains in detail how the request meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(2) Certifies that the explanation is true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief.</P>
            <P>(3) If the request is made referencing paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requester must substantiate the public interest.</P>
            <P>(e) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests must be submitted to the FOIA office responsible for processing the requested records.</P>
            <P>(f) The FOIA office must notify the requester of its decision to grant or deny expedited processing within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt.</P>
            <P>(g) If expedited processing is granted, the request will be processed on a first-in, first-out basis in that queue.</P>
            <P>(h) If expedited processing is denied, the FOIA office will notify the requester and provide information on appealing this decision in accordance with Subpart G of this part and place the request in the appropriate processing queue.</P>
            <P>(i) If the FOIA office processing the request does not provide notification of either granting or denying the request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt, the requester may file an appeal for non-response in accordance with subpart G of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures and time limits for acknowledgement letters and initial determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Following receipt of a request submitted under the FOIA, the FOIA staff will send an acknowledgement letter providing the case tracking number and processing track within ten (10) working days from date of receipt to the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) An initial determination is a decision by a NASA official, in response to a request by a member of the public for an Agency record, on whether the record described in the request can be identified and located after a reasonable search and, if so, whether the record (or portions thereof) will be made available under this part or will be withheld from disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(c) An initial determination on a request for an Agency record addressed in accordance with this regulation (to include one submitted in person at a FOIA office) shall be made (for example, to grant, partially grant or deny a request), and the requester shall be sent an initial determination letter within 20 working days after receipt of the request, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (unless unusual circumstances exist as defined in § 1206.403).</P>
            <P>(d) The basic time limit for a misdirected FOIA request (not a referral or consultation) begins on the date on which the request is first received by the appropriate FOIA office within the Agency, but in any event no later than ten (10) working days after the date the request is first received by a FOIA office designated to receive FOIA requests.</P>
            <P>(e) Any notification of an initial determination that does not comply fully with the request for an Agency record, including those searches that produce no responsive documents, shall include a statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, include the name and title of the person making the initial determination, and notify the requester of the right to appeal to the Administrator or the Inspector General, as appropriate, pursuant to subpart G of this part, and the right to seek dispute resolution services from the NASA FOIA Public Liaison or Office of Government Information Services.</P>

Receipt of the requester's response by the FOIA office to the Agency's request for additional information or clarification ends the temporary time suspension.</P>

            <P>(a) In “unusual circumstances” as defined in this section, the time limits for an initial determination and for a final determination may be extended, but not to exceed a total of 10 working days in the aggregate in the processing of any specific request for an Agency record. The extension must be taken before the expiration of the 20 working day time limits. The requester will be notified in writing of:</P>
            <P>(1) The unusual circumstances surrounding the extension of the time limit;</P>
            <P>(2) The date by which the FOIA office expects to complete the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(b) Unusual circumstances are defined as:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from offices other than the office processing the request;</P>

            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous number of documents;<PRTPAGE P="54"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The need to coordinate and/or consult with another NASA office or agency having a substantial subject-matter interest in the determination of the request.</P>
            <P>(c) If initial processing time will exceed or is expected to exceed 30 working days, the FOIA office will notify the requester of the delay in processing and:</P>
            <P>(1) Provide the opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the Agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide contact information for the NASA FOIA Public Liaison;</P>
            <P>(3) Offer the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the OGIS;</P>
            <P>(4) Provide information regarding the intended determination; and</P>
            <P>(5) Shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for the purpose of this paragraph (c).</P>
            <P>(d) The requester's refusal to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative timeframe for processing a request after being given the opportunity to do so may be considered a factor when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist. A delay that results from a predictable workload of requests does not constitute exceptional circumstances unless the Agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.</P>

            <P>(a) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. A search will determine what specific documents, if any, are responsive to a request. A search for Agency records responsive to a request may be accomplished by manual or automated means.</P>

            <P>(c) In responding to FOIA requests, FOIA offices shall charge the following fees based on the date the request is received in the NASA FOIA Office unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under § 1206.506. Fees will be determined on October 1st of each year based on the appropriate General Schedule (GS) base salary, plus the District of Columbia locality payment, plus 16 percent for benefits of employees.

            <P>(a) Review means the process of examining a document(s) located in response to a request to determine whether the document(s) or any portion thereof is disclosable. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(b) Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by Agency staff to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record.</P>
            <P>(c) Review fees will be charged to commercial use requesters.</P>
            <P>(d) No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, when the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with an additional review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.</P>
            <P>(e) Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under § 1206.500.</P>
            <P>(f) Review fees can be charged even if the record(s) reviewed ultimately is not disclosed.</P>
            <P>(g) Review fees will not include costs incurred in resolving issues of law or policy that may be raised in the course of processing a request under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Duplication.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.</P>
            <P>(b) FOIA offices shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the FOIA office in the form or format requested. If the records are not readily reproducible in the requested form or format, the Agency will so inform the requester. The requester may specify an alternative form or format that is available. If in this situation the requester refuses to specify an alternative form or format, the Agency will not process the request any further.</P>
            <P>(c) Where standard-sized photocopies or scans are supplied, the FOIA office will provide one copy per request at the regular copy rate per page.</P>
            <P>(d) For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, FOIA offices will charge the direct costs of producing the copy in the form or format requested, including the time spent by personnel duplicating the requested records. For each quarter hour spent by personnel duplicating the requested records, the fees will be the same as those charged for a search under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(e) If NASA staff must scan paper documents in order to accommodate a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the appropriate copy fee charge per page as well as each quarter hour spent by personnel scanning the requested records. Fees will be the same as those charged for search under this subpart for each quarter hour spent by personnel scanning the requested records.</P>

            <P>(f) For other forms of duplication, FOIA offices will charge the direct costs as well as any associated personnel costs. For standard-sized copies of documents such as letters, memoranda, statements, reports, contracts, etc., $0.15 per copy of each page; charges for double-sided copies will be $0.30. For copies of oversized documents, such as maps, charts, etc., fees will be assessed as direct costs. Charges for copies (and scanning) include the time spent in duplicating the documents. For copies of computer disks, still photographs, blueprints, videotapes, engineering drawings, hard copies of aperture cards, etc., the fee charged will reflect the direct cost to NASA of reproducing, copying, or scanning the record. In circumstances where a request for a videotape or other outdated media is requested, and NASA does not have the capability to readily reproduce the record in the form or format requested and which requires the Agency to enlist the services of a private contractor to fulfill the request, the direct costs of any services by the private contractor will be <PRTPAGE P="56"/>charged to the requester. Specific charges will be provided upon request.</P>
            <P>(g) If the request for an Agency record required to be made available under this part requires a computerized search or printout, the charge for the time of personnel involved shall be at the rates specified in this part or the direct costs assessed to the Agency. The charge for computer time involved and for any special supplies or materials used shall not exceed the direct cost to NASA.</P>
            <P>(h) Reasonable standard fees may be charged for additional direct costs incurred in searching for or duplicating an Agency record in response to a request under this part. Charges made under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the transportation of NASA personnel to places of record storage for search purposes or freight charges for transporting records to the personnel searching for or duplicating a requested record.</P>
            <P>(i) Complying with requests for special services such as those listed in this section is entirely at the discretion of NASA. To the extent that NASA elects to provide the following services, it will levy a charge equivalent to the full cost of the service provided:</P>
            <P>(1) Certifying that records are true copies.</P>
            <P>(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.</P>
            <P>(3) Packaging and mailing bulky records that will not fit into the largest envelope carried in the supply inventory.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Restrictions on charging fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(b) If NASA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) If a NASA component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and the component provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.</P>
            <P>(2) If NASA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Agency may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The Agency must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the component must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If the exception in this paragraph (b)(2) is satisfied, the Agency may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(c) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
            <P>(d) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, NASA will provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(1) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and</P>
            <P>(2) The first two hours of search.</P>
            <P>(e) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under § 1206.504 is less than $50.00 for any request, no fee will be charged.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Charging fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NASA shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and the OMB Guidelines. NASA will ordinarily use the most efficient and least expensive method for processing requested records. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, NASA may contact a requester for additional information. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. The submission of a FOIA request shall be considered a firm commitment by the requester to pay all applicable fees charged under this section, up to $50.00, unless the requester seeks a waiver of fees. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. When a FOIA office determines or estimates the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will amount to or exceed $50.00, the FOIA office shall notify the requester unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If a portion of the fees can be readily estimated, the FOIA office shall advise the requester accordingly.</P>
            <P>(b) In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees are in excess of $50.00, the request shall be placed on hold and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated fees. Such a commitment must be made by the requester in writing, must indicate a given dollar amount or a willingness to pay all processing fees, and must be received by the FOIA office within 20 working days from the date of the letter providing notification of the fee estimate. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.</P>
            <P>(c) After the FOIA office begins processing a request, if it finds that the actual cost will exceed the amount the requester previously agreed to pay, the FOIA office will stop processing the request and promptly notify the requester of the higher amount. The request will be placed on hold until the fee issue has been resolved. If the issue is not resolved within 20 working days from the date of the notification letter, NASA will provide the requester, if the requester is a non-commercial use requester, the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and shall advise the requester that his statutory entitlements have been provided before closing the request.</P>
            <P>(d) Direct costs, meaning those expenditures that NASA actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and downloading computer files and documents in response to a FOIA request, will be included on the invoice as appropriate. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee who would ordinarily perform the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners, the costs associated with retrieving records stored at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, as well as costs for CDs and other media tools.</P>
            <P>(e) NASA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the FOIA office. NASA will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>

            <P>(f) If processing fees are less than $50.00, NASA will send all releaseable documents (or portions thereof) following the completion of the initial determination. If fees are greater than $50.00, the documents will not be released until the invoice has been paid and verified by the FOIA office.<PRTPAGE P="58"/>
            </P>
            <P>(g) Final billing will be sent when the initial determination has been completed. At that time the case will be closed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Advance payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this section, a FOIA office shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment for search, review and/or before records are released to a requester) is not an advance payment.</P>
            <P>(b) When a FOIA office determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A FOIA office may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester.</P>
            <P>(c) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee assessed by any FOIA office in the agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a FOIA office may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest due on the outstanding debt, before the FOIA office begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending remand of an appeal. Once the outstanding bill has been paid, the FOIA office may also require the requester to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before processing the new request.</P>
            <P>(d) Where a FOIA office has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide further proof of identity.</P>
            <P>(e) In cases in which a FOIA office requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received, and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 20 working days after the date of the FOIA office's letter, the request will be closed without further notification.</P>
            <P>(f) When advance payment is required in order to initiate processing, after a fee estimate has been determined, the FOIA office will require payment before continuing to process the request.</P>
            <P>(g) The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the FOIA office will inform the requester of the contact information for that source.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The burden is on the requester to justify an entitlement to a fee waiver. (See § 1206.507 for a discussion on fee categories.)</P>
            <P>(b) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis using the criteria in this section. These statutory requirements must be satisfied by the requester before properly assessable fees are waived or reduced under the statutory standard.</P>
            <P>(c) Records shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate if the requester has demonstrated, based on all available information, that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it:</P>
            <P>(1) Is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and</P>
            <P>(2) Is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(d) In deciding whether the standards of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied, the Agency must consider the factors described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:</P>

            <P>(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the Government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a <PRTPAGE P="59"/>connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
            <P>(2) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. The factor in this paragraph (d)(2) is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about Government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
            <P>(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. NASA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy the consideration in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).</P>
            <P>(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components will consider the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) NASA, and its Centers processing requests, must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding the consideration in this paragraph (d)(3)(i).</P>
            <P>(ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, NASA must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. NASA ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
            <P>(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees under this section, a waiver shall be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to NASA and should address the criteria referenced in paragraph (d) of this section. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P>
            <P>(e) FOIA offices may make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request in an effort to reduce fees; however, the FOIA staff may not assist a requester in composing a request, advising what specific records to request, or how to write a request to qualify for a fee waiver.</P>
            <P>(f) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a partial waiver shall be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(g) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Agency and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal.</P>

            <P>(h) When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was <PRTPAGE P="60"/>received by the office processing the original request.</P>
            <P>(i) When deciding whether to waive or reduce fees, the FOIA office will rely on the fee waiver justification submitted in the request letter. If the request letter does not include sufficient justification, the FOIA office will either deny the fee waiver request or at its discretion, ask for additional justification from the requester.</P>
            <P>(j) FOIA offices may make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request in an effort to reduce fees; however, the FOIA staff may not assist a requester in composing a request, advising what specific records to request, or how to write a request to qualify for a fee waiver.</P>

            <P>(c) The FOIA provides for three categories of requesters. However, for clarity purposes, NASA has broken them down to four for the purposes of determining fees. These four categories of FOIA requesters are: Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these categories, which is indicated in the FOIA fee table above.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> When NASA receives a request for documents appearing to be for commercial use, meaning a request from or on behalf of one whom seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation, of either the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, it will assess charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. NASA will not consider a commercial-use request for a waiver or reduction of fees based upon an assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest. A request from a corporation (not a news media corporation) may be presumed to be for commercial use unless the requester demonstrates that it qualifies for a different fee category. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two (2) hours of search time or to 100 pages of duplication of documents without charge.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Education and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> To be eligible for inclusion in the category in this paragraph (c)(2), requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not being sought for a commercial use (not operated for commerce, trade, or profit), but are being sought in furtherance of scholarly (if <PRTPAGE P="61"/>the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
            <P>(i) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in the fee category in this paragraph (c)(2) must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. NASA may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in the category in this paragraph (c)(2). A request for educational purposes may be presumed if submitted on the Institution's letterhead and signed by the Dean of the School or Department.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> A student, who makes a request in furtherance of the student's coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of the fee category in this paragraph (c)(2).</P>
            <P>(ii) For the purposes of a non-commercial scientific institution, it must be solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. Requests must be sent on the letterhead of the scientific institution and signed by the responsible official-in-charge of the project/program associated with the subject of the documents that are being requested.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Representative of the news media.</E> (i) NASA shall provide documents to requesters in the category in this paragraph (c)(3) for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.</P>
            <P>(ii) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of new media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. These examples are not all inclusive. As methods of news delivery evolve, alternative news media entities may come into existence. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. Agencies will advise requesters of their placement in the category in this paragraph (c)(3).</P>
            <P>(iii) Requesters seeking the fee category in this paragraph (c)(3) who do not articulate sufficient information to support their request will not be included in the fee category in this paragraph (c)(3). Additionally, FOIA staff may grant a reduction of fees if the requester can articulate the information of this section for some of the documents.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> NASA shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories mentioned in this section fees in accordance with the fee table in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees.</P>
            <P>(b) When NASA has reason to believe that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests on a single subject or related subjects for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, NASA will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
            <P>(c) NASA will consider that multiple requests made within a 30-day period were so intended submitted as such to avoid fees, unless there is evidence to the contrary.</P>
            <P>(d) NASA will aggregate requests separated by a longer period of time only when there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Notice shall be given to a submitter whenever the information requested is commercial information and has been designated by the submitter as information deemed protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Act, or the Agency otherwise has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. For the purpose of applying the notice requirements, commercial information is information provided by a submitter and in the possession of NASA, that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under the provisions of Exemption 4 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). The meaning ascribed to this term for the purpose of this notice requirement is separate and should not be confused with use of this or similar terms in determining whether information satisfies one of the elements of Exemption 4.</P>
            <P>(b) A submitter is a person or entity outside the Federal Government from whom the Agency directly or indirectly obtains commercial or financial information. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to corporations, state governments, individuals, and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>(c) The notice requirements of § 1206.601 will not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The information has been lawfully published or officially made available to the public; or</P>
            <P>(2) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute (other than this part); or</P>

            <P>(3) The submitter has received notice of a previous FOIA request which encompassed information requested in the later request, and the Agency intends to withhold and/or release information in the same manner as in the previous FOIA request.<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) An additional limited exception to the notice requirements of § 1206.601, to be used only when all of the following exceptional circumstances are found to be present, authorizes the Agency to withhold information that is the subject of a FOIA request, based on Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)), without providing the submitter individual notice when:</P>
            <P>(1) The Agency would be required to provide notice to over ten (10) submitters, in which case, notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.</P>
            <P>(2) Absent any response to the published notice, the Agency determines that if it provided notice as is otherwise required by § 1206.601, it is reasonable to assume that the submitter would object to disclosure of the information based on Exemption 4; and,</P>
            <P>(3) If the submitter expressed the anticipated objections, the Agency would uphold those objections.</P>
            <P>(e) The exception shall be used only with the approval of the Chief Counsel of the Center, the Counsel to the Inspector General, or the Associate General Counsel responsible for providing advice on the request. This exception shall not be used for a class of documents or requests, but only as warranted by an individual FOIA request.</P>

            <P>(7) Notice that failing to respond within the timeframe specified under § 1206.601(b)(4) will create a presumption that the submitter has no objection to the disclosure of the information in question.</P>

            <P>(b) The submitter must include a daytime telephone number, an email and mailing address, and a fax number if available on a response to the FOIA office.</P>

            <P>(b) Whenever the Agency decides to disclose commercial information over the objection of a submitter, the Agency shall forward to the submitter a written statement which shall include the following:</P>

            <P>(a) To determine if information on the requester is included in a system of records;</P>
            <P>(b) For access to a record under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1); and</P>
            <P>(c) For an accounting of disclosures of the individual's Privacy Act records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).</P>
            <CITA>[57 FR 4928, Feb. 11, 1992, as amended at 77 FR 60621, Oct. 4, 2012]</CITA>

            <SECTNO>§ 1212.201</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requesting a record.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Individuals may request access to their Privacy Act records, either in person or in writing.</P>
            <P>(b) Individuals may also authorize a third party to have access to their Privacy Act records. This authorization shall be in writing, signed by the individual and contain the individual's address as well as the name and address of the representative being authorized access. The identities of both the subject individual and the representative must be verified in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1212.202 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Requests must be directed to the appropriate system manager, or, if unknown, to the Center Privacy Manager or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at NASA Headquarters or Field Center. The request should be identified clearly on the envelope and on the letter as a “Request Under the Privacy Act.”</P>
            <P>(2) Where possible, requests should contain the following information to ensure timely processing:</P>
            <P>(i) Name and address of subject.</P>
            <P>(ii) Identity of the system of records.</P>
            <P>(iii) Nature of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) Identifying information specified in the applicable system notice to assist in identifying the request, such as location of the record, if known, full name, birth date, time periods in which the records are believed to have been compiled, etc.</P>
            <P>(d) NASA has no obligation to comply with a nonspecific request for access to information concerning an individual, e.g., a request to provide copies of “all information contained in your files concerning me,” although a good faith effort will be made to locate records if there is reason to believe NASA has records on the individual. If the request is so incomplete or incomprehensible that the requested record cannot be identified, additional information or clarification will be requested in the acknowledgement, and assistance to the individual will be offered as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Center Privacy Manager receives a request for access, the Privacy Manager will record the date of receipt and immediately forward the request to the responsible system manager for handling.</P>
            <P>(f) If the Center FOIA Office receives a first party request for records or access, the FOIA Office will process the request under the Privacy Act pursuant to this part.</P>
            <P>(g) Normally, the system manager shall respond to a request for access within 10 work days of receipt of the request and the access shall be provided within 30 work days of receipt.</P>

            <P>(1) In response to a request for access, the system manager shall:<PRTPAGE P="74"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Notify the requester that there is no record on the individual in the system of records and inform the requester of the procedures to follow for appeal (See § 1212.4);</P>
            <P>(ii) Notify the requester that the record is exempt from disclosure, cite the appropriate exemption, and inform the requester of the procedures to follow for appeal (See § 1212.4);</P>
            <P>(iii) Upon request, promptly provide copies of the record, subject to the fee requirements (§ 1212.204); or</P>
            <P>(iv) Make the individual's record available for personal inspection in the presence of a NASA representative.</P>
            <P>(2) Unless the system manager agrees to another location, personal inspection of the record shall be at the location of the record as identified in the system notice.</P>
            <P>(3) When an individual requests records in a system of records maintained on a third party, the request shall be processed as a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request under 14 CFR part 1206. If the records requested are subject to release under FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), then a Privacy Act exemption may not be invoked to deny access.</P>
            <P>(4) When an individual requests records in a system of records maintained on the individual, the request shall be processed under this part. NASA will not rely on exemptions contained in FOIA to withhold any record which is otherwise accessible to the individual under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) The system manager will release records to the requester or representative in person only upon production of satisfactory identification which includes the individual's name, signature, and photograph or physical description.</P>
            <P>(b) The system manager will release copies of records by mail only when the circumstances indicate that the requester and the subject of the record are the same. The system manager may require that the requester's signature be notarized or witnessed by two individuals unrelated to the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) Identity procedures more stringent than those required in this section may be prescribed in the system notice when the records are medical or otherwise sensitive.</P>

            <P>(a) The system manager shall keep a disclosure accounting for each disclosure to a third party of a record from a system of records. This includes records disclosed pursuant to computer matching programs.</P>
            <P>(b) Disclosure accountings are not required but are recommended for disclosures made:</P>
            <P>(1) With the subject individual's consent; or</P>
            <P>(2) In accordance with § 1212.203(f) (1) and (2), below.</P>
            <P>(c) The disclosure accounting required by paragraph (a) of this section shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) The date, nature, and purpose of the disclosure; and</P>
            <P>(2) The name and address of the recipient person or Agency.</P>
            <P>(d) The disclosure accounting shall be retained for at least 5 years after the disclosure or for the life of the record, whichever is longer.</P>
            <P>(e) The disclosure accounting maintained under the requirements of this section is not itself a system of records.</P>
            <P>(f) Records in a NASA system of records may not be disclosed to third parties without the consent of the subject individual. However, in consonance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), disclosure may be authorized without consent, if disclosure would be:</P>

          <P>(d) Center Public Affairs Directors are responsible for implementing their portion of the Agency's communications program, adhering to Agency policies, procedures, and priorities, and coordinating their activities with Headquarters (and others where appropriate). They are responsible for the quality of public information prepared by Center Public Affairs Officers. They also are responsible for the day-to-day production of public information covering their respective Center activities, which includes obtaining the necessary Center concurrences and coordinating, as necessary, with the appropriate Headquarters Public Affairs Officers.</P>

          <P>(e) Center Directors have ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of public information that does not require <PRTPAGE P="86"/>the concurrence of Headquarters. <E T="03">See</E> § 1213.104(d).</P>
          <P>(f) All NASA employees are required to coordinate, in a timely manner, with the appropriate Public Affairs Officers prior to releasing information that has the potential to generate significant media or public interest or inquiry.</P>
          <P>(g) All NASA Public Affairs Officers are required to notify the appropriate Headquarters Public Affairs Officers, in a timely manner, about activities or events that have the potential to generate significant media or public interest or inquiry.</P>
          <P>(h) All NASA public affairs employees are expected to adhere to the following code of conduct:</P>
          <P>(1) Be honest and accurate in all communications.</P>
          <P>(2) Honor publication embargoes.</P>
          <P>(3) Respond promptly to media requests, and respect media deadlines.</P>
          <P>(4) Act promptly to notify the public of, and correct, erroneous information, either internally or externally.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Public information coordination and concurrence.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> All NASA employees involved in preparing and issuing NASA public information are responsible for proper coordination among Headquarters and Center offices to include review and clearance by appropriate officials prior to issuance. Such coordination will be accomplished through procedures developed and published by the NASA Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> To ensure timely release of public information, Headquarters and Center Public Affairs Officers are required to coordinate to obtain review and clearance by appropriate officials, keep each other informed of changes, delays, or cancellation of releases, and provide advance notification of the actual release.</P>
          <P>(c) All public information shall be coordinated through the appropriate Headquarters offices, including review by the appropriate Mission Directorate Associate Administrator and Mission Support Office head, or their designees, to ensure scientific, technical, and programmatic accuracy, and review by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs or his/her designee to ensure that public information products are well written and appropriate for the intended audience.</P>
          <P>(d) Centers may, however, without the full coordination of Headquarters, issue public information that is institutional in nature, of local interest, or has been deemed not to be a Headquarters release. These releases must be coordinated through the appropriate Center offices and approved by the Center Director and Center Public Affairs Director. The Center Public Affairs Director is required to provide proper notification to the Office of Public Affairs, NASA Headquarters, prior to release. The Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs or his/her designee will determine which public information will be issued nationwide by NASA Headquarters and shall publish guidelines for the release of public information that may be issued by Centers without clearance from Headquarters offices.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Dispute Resolution.</E> Any dispute arising from a decision to proceed or not proceed with the issuance of a news release or other type of public information will be addressed and resolved by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs with the appropriate Mission Directorate Associate Administrator, Mission Support Office head, Center Director, and others, such as Center Public Affairs Directors, as necessary. However, the appropriate Mission Directorate Associate Administrator <PRTPAGE P="87"/>shall be the arbiter of disputes about the accuracy or characterization of programmatic, technical, or scientific information. Additional appeals may be made to the Chief of Strategic Communications and to the Office of the Administrator. When requested by a Center Public Affairs Director, an explanation of the resolution will be provided in writing to all interested Agency parties.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Interviews.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Only spokespersons designated by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, or his/her designee, are authorized to speak for the Agency in an official capacity regarding NASA policy, programmatic, and budget issues.</P>
          <P>(b) In response to media interview requests, NASA will offer articulate and knowledgeable spokespersons who can best serve the needs of the media and the American public. However, journalists may have access to the NASA officials they seek to interview, provided those NASA officials agree to be interviewed.</P>
          <P>(c) NASA employees may speak to the media and the public about their work. When doing so, employees shall notify their immediate supervisor and coordinate with their public affairs office in advance of interviews whenever possible, or immediately thereafter, and are encouraged, to the maximum extent practicable, to have a Public Affairs Officer present during interviews. If Public Affairs Officers are present, their role will be to attest to the content of the interview, support the interviewee, and provide post-interview follow up with the media, as necessary.</P>
          <P>(d) NASA, as an Agency, does not take a position on any scientific conclusions. That is the role of the broad scientific community and the nature of the scientific process. NASA scientists may draw conclusions and may, consistent with this policy, communicate those conclusions to the media. However, NASA employees who present personal views outside their official area of expertise or responsibility must make clear that they are presenting their individual views—not the views of the Agency—and ask that they be sourced as such.</P>
          <P>(e) Appropriated funds may only be used to support Agency missions and objectives consistent with legislative or presidential direction. Government funds shall not be used for media interviews or other communication activities that go beyond the scope of Agency responsibilities and/or an employee's official area of expertise or responsibility.</P>
          <P>(f) Media interviews will be “on-the-record” and attributable to the person making the remarks, unless the interviewee is authorized to do otherwise by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs or Center Public Affairs Director, or their designees. Any NASA employee providing material to the press will identify himself/herself as the source.</P>
          <P>(g) Audio recordings may be made by NASA with consent of the interviewee.</P>
          <P>(h) NASA employees are not required to speak to the media.</P>
          <P>(i) Public information volunteered by a NASA official will not be considered exclusive to any one media source and will be made available to other sources, if requested.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preventing release of classified information to the media.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Release of classified information in any form (e.g., documents, through interviews, audio/visual) to the news media is prohibited. The disclosure of classified information to unauthorized individuals may be cause for prosecution and/or disciplinary action against the NASA employee involved. Ignorance of NASA policy and procedures regarding classified information does not release a NASA employee from responsibility for preventing any unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1, Chapter 5, Section 5.23 for internal NASA guidance on management of classified information. For further guidance that applies to all agencies, see Executive Order 12958, as amended, “Classified National Security Information,” and its implementing directive at 32 CFR parts 2001 and 2004.</P>

          <P>(b) Any attempt by news media representatives to obtain classified information will be reported through the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs or Installation Public Affairs Office to <PRTPAGE P="88"/>the Installation Security Office and Office of Security and Program Protection.</P>

          <P>(c) For classified operations and/or programs managed under the auspices of a DD Form 254, <E T="03">“Contract Security Classification Specification,”</E> all inquiries concerning this activity will be responded to by the appropriate PAO official designated in Item 12 on the DD Form 254.</P>
          <P>(d) For classified operations and/or information owned by other Government agencies (e.g., DOD, DOE), all inquiries will be referred to the appropriate Agency Public Affairs Officer as established in written agreements.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preventing unauthorized release of sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information/material to the news media.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) All NASA SBU information requires accountability and approval for release. Release of SBU information to unauthorized personnel is prohibited. Unauthorized release of SBU information may result in prosecution and/or disciplinary action. Ignorance of NASA policy and procedures regarding SBU information does not release a NASA employee from responsibility for unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1, Chapter 5, Section 5.24 for guidance on identification, marking, accountability and release of NASA SBU information.</P>
          <P>(b) Examples of SBU information include: proprietary information of others provided to NASA under nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement; source selection and bid and proposal information; information subject to export control under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR); information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974; predecisional materials such as national space policy not yet publicly released; pending reorganization plans or sensitive travel itineraries; and information that could constitute an indicator of U.S. Government intentions, capabilities, operations, or activities or otherwise threaten operations security.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon request for access to information/material deemed SBU, coordination must be made with the information/material owner to determine if the information/material may be released. Other organizations that play a part in SBU information identification, accountability, and release (e.g., General Counsel, External Relations, Procurement) must be consulted for assistance and/or concurrence prior to release.</P>
          <P>(d) Requests for SBU information from other Government agencies must be referred to the NASA program or other office responsible for handling the information as SBU.</P>

          <P>(b) Centers will provide the media, the public, and as necessary, NASA Headquarters with:</P>
          <P>(1) Selected prints and original or duplicate files of news-oriented imagery and other digital multimedia material generated within their respective areas.</P>
          <P>(2) Selected video material in the highest quality format practical, which, in the opinion of the installations, would be appropriate for use as news feed material or features in pre-produced programs and other presentations.</P>
          <P>(3) Audio and/or video files of significant news developments and other events of historic or public interest.</P>
          <P>(4) Interactive multimedia features that can be incorporated into the Agency's Internet portal for use by internal and external audiences, including the media and the general public.</P>

This CCOC succeeds the NASA-RSA Interim Code of Conduct, which was developed pursuant to Article 11.2 of the MOU <PRTPAGE P="91"/>between NASA and RSA to cover early assembly prior to other partners' flight opportunities.</P>
              <P>This CCOC sets forth the standards of conduct applicable to all ISS crewmembers during preflight, on-orbit, and post-flight activities, (including launch and return phases). ISS crewmembers are subject to additional requirements, such as the ISS Flight Rules, the disciplinary policy, and requirements imposed by their Cooperating Agency or those relating to the Earth-to-Orbit Vehicle (ETOV) transporting an ISS crewmember. Each ISS crewmember has a right to know about such additional requirements. ISS crewmembers will also abide by the rules of the institution hosting the training, and by standards and requirements defined by the Multilateral Crew Operations Panel (MCOP), the Multilateral Space Medicine Board (MSMB) and the Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP). Each ISS crewmember will be informed by the Cooperating Agency providing him or her of the responsibilities of ISS crewmembers under the IGA, the MOU's and this CCOC. Further, each ISS crewmember will be educated by the Cooperating Agency providing him or her through the crew training curriculum and normal program operations as to ISS program rules, operational directives and management policies. Completion of postflight activities shall not affect an ISS crewmember's continuing obligations under Section V of this CCOC.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Authority and Responsibilities of the ISS Commander</HD>
              <P>The ISS Commander, as an ISS crewmember, is subject to the standards detailed elsewhere in this CCOC, in addition to the command-specific provisions set forth below:</P>
              <P>The ISS Commander will seek to maintain a harmonious and cohesive relationship among the ISS crewmembers and an appropriate level of mutual confidence and respect through an interactive, participative, and relationship-oriented approach which duly takes into account the international and multicultural nature of the crew and mission.</P>
              <P>For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section shall affect the ability of the MCOP to designate the national of any Partner State as an ISS Commander.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(1) During Preflight and Postflight Activities</HD>
              <P>The ISS Commander is the leader of the crew and is responsible for forming the individual ISS crewmembers into a single, integrated team. During preflight activities, the ISS Commander, to the extent of his or her authority, leads the ISS crewmembers through the training curriculum and mission-preparation activities and seeks to ensure that the ISS crewmembers are adequately prepared for the mission, acting as the crew's representative to the ISS program's training, medical, operations, and utilization authorities. During postflight activities, the ISS Commander coordinates as necessary with these authorities to ensure that the ISS crewmembers complete the required postflight activities.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(2) During On-Orbit Operations</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(a) General</HD>
              <P>The ISS Commander is responsible for and will, to the extent of his or her authority and the ISS on-orbit capabilities, accomplish the mission program implementation and ensure the safety of the ISS crewmembers and the protection of the ISS elements, equipment, or payloads.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(b) Main Responsibilities</HD>
              <P>The ISS Commander's main responsibilities are to: (1) Conduct operations in or on the ISS as directed by the Flight Director and in accordance with the Flight Rules, plans and procedures; (2) direct the activities of the ISS crewmembers as a single, integrated team to ensure the successful completion of the mission; (3) fully and accurately inform the Flight Director, in a timely manner, of the ISS vehicle configuration, status, commanding, and other operational activities on-board (including off-nominal or emergency situations); (4) enforce procedures for the physical and information security of operations and utilization data; (5) maintain order; (6) ensure crew safety, health and well-being including crew rescue and return; and (7) take all reasonable action necessary for the protection of the ISS elements, equipment, or payloads.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">(c) Scope of Authority</HD>

              <P>During all phases of on-orbit activity, the ISS Commander, consistent with the authority of the Flight Director, shall have the authority to use any reasonable and necessary means to fulfill his or her responsibilities. This authority, which shall be exercised consistent with the provisions of Sections II and IV, extends to: (1) the ISS elements, equipment, and payloads; (2) the ISS crewmembers; (3) activities of any kind occurring in or on the ISS; and (4) data and personal effects in or on the ISS where necessary to protect the safety and well-being of the ISS crewmembers and the ISS elements, equipment, and payloads. Any matter outside the ISS Commander's authority shall be within the purview of the Flight Director.<PRTPAGE P="93"/>
              </P>
              <P>Issues regarding the Commander's use of such authority shall be referred to the Flight Director as soon as practicable, who will refer the matter to appropriate authorities for further handling. Although other ISS crewmembers may have authority over and responsibility for certain ISS elements, equipment, payloads, or tasks, the ISS Commander remains ultimately responsible, and solely accountable, to the Flight Director for the successful completion of the activities and the mission.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Chain of Command and Succession On-orbit</HD>
              <P>(1) The ISS Commander is the highest authority among the ISS crewmembers on-orbit. The MCOP will determine the order of succession among the ISS crewmembers in advance of flight, and the Flight Rules set forth the implementation of a change of command.</P>
              <P>(2) Relationship of the ISS Commander to ETOV and Other Commanders</P>
              <P>The Flight Rules define the authority of the ETOV Commander, the Rescue Vehicle Commander, and any other commanders, and set forth the relationship between their respective authorities and the authority of the ISS Commander.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Relationship Between the ISS Commander (On-Orbit Management) and the Flight Director (Ground Management)</HD>
              <P>The Flight Director is responsible for directing the mission. A Flight Director will be in charge of directing real-time ISS operations at all time. The ISS Commander, working under the direction of the Flight Director and in accordance with the Flight Rules, is responsible for conducting on-orbit operations in the manner best suited to the effective implementation of the mission. The ISS Commander, acting on his or her own authority, is entitled to change the daily routine of the ISS crewmembers where necessary to address contingencies, perform urgent work associated with crew safety and the protection of the ISS elements, equipment or payloads, or conduct critical flight operations. Otherwise, the ISS Commander should implement the mission as directed by the Flight Director. Specific roles and responsibilities of the ISS Commander and the Flight Director are described in the Flight Rules. The Flight Rules outline decisions planned in advance of the mission and are designed to minimize the amount of real-time discussion required during mission operations.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Disciplinary Regulations</HD>
              <P>ISS crewmembers will be subject to the disciplinary policy developed and revised as necessary by the MCOP and approved by the Multilateral Coordination Board (MCB). The MCOP has developed an initial disciplinary policy which has been approved by the MCB. The disciplinary policy is designed to maintain order among the ISS crewmembers during preflight, on-orbit and postflight activities. The disciplinary policy is administrative in nature and is intended to address violations of the CCOC. Such violations may, inter alia, affect flight assignments as an ISS crewmember. The disciplinary policy does not limit a Cooperating Agency's right to apply relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures to the ISS crewmembers it provides, consistent with the IGA and the MOU's.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Physical and Information Security Guidelines</HD>
              <P>The use of all equipment and goods to which ISS crewmembers have access shall be limited to the performance of ISS duties. Marked or otherwise identified as export controlled data and marked proprietary data obtained by an ISS crewmember in the course of ISS activities shall only be used in the performance of his or her ISS duties. With respect to data first generated on-board the ISS, the ISS crewmembers will be advised by the appropriate Cooperating Agency or by the data owner or provider through that Cooperating Agency as to the proprietary or export-controlled nature of the data and will be directed to mark and protect such data and to continue such protection for as long as the requirements for such protection remain in place. Additionally, ISS crewmembers shall act in a manner consistent with the provisions of the IGA and the MOU's regarding protection of operations data, utilization data, and the intellectual property of ISS users. They shall also comply with applicable ISS program rules, operational directives, and management policies designed to further such protections.</P>

              <P>Personal information about ISS crewmembers, including all medical information, private family conference, or other private information, whether from verbal, written, or electronic sources, shall not be used or disclosed by other ISS crewmembers for any purpose, without the consent of the affected ISS crewmember, except as required for the immediate safety of ISS crewmembers or the protection of ISS elements, equipment, or payloads. In particular, all personal medical information, whether derived from medical monitoring, investigations, or medical contingency events, shall be treated as private medical information and shall be transmitted in a private and secure fashion in accordance with procedures to be set forth by the MMOP. Medical data which must be handled in this fashion includes, for example, biomedical telemetry, private medical communications, and medical investigation <PRTPAGE P="94"/>data. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to limit an ISS crewmember's access to all medical resources aboard the ISS, to ground-based medical support services, or to his or her own medical data during preflight, on-orbit, and postflight activities.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Protection of Human Research Subjects</HD>
              <P>No research on human subjects shall be conducted which could, with reasonable foresight, be expected to jeopardize the life, health, physical integrity, or safety of the subject.</P>
              <P>No research procedures shall be undertaken with any ISS crewmember as a human subject without: (1) written approval by the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB) and (2) the full written and informed consent of the human subject. Each such approval and consent shall be obtained prior to the initiation of such research, and shall fully comply with the requirements of the HRMRB. The HRMRB is responsible for procedures for initiation of new experiments on-orbit when all consent requirements have been met, but the signature of the human subject cannot be obtained; explicit consent of the human subject will nonetheless be required in all such cases. Subjects volunteering for human research protocols may at their own discretion, and without providing a rationale, withdraw their consent for participation at any time, without prejudice, and without incurring disciplinary action. In addition, approval or consent for any research may be revoked at any time, including after the commencement of the research, by: the HRMRB, the Crew Surgeon, the Flight Director, or the ISS Commander, as appropriate, if the research would endanger the ISS Crew Member or otherwise threaten the mission success. A decision to revoke consent by the human subject or approval by the other entities listed above will be final.</P>

            <P>TDRSS represents a major investment by the U.S. Government with the primary goal of providing improved tracking and data acquisition services to spacecraft in low-Earth orbit or to mobile terrestrial users such as aircraft or balloons. It is the objective of NASA to operate as efficiently as possible with TDRSS, is to the mutual benefit of all users. Such user consideration will permit NASA and non-NASA service to be delivered without compromising the mission objectives of any individual user. The reimbursement policy is designed to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25 on User Charges, dated September 23, 1959, as updated, which requires that a reasonable charge should be made to each identifiable recipient for a measurable unit or amount of Government service or property from which a special benefit is derived.</P>

            <P>Potential users should become familiar with TDRSS capabilities and constraints, which are detailed in the SNUG, as early as possible. This action allows the user to evaluate the trade-offs available among various TDRSS services, spacecraft design, operations planning, and other significant mission parameters. It is recommended that potential users contact the NIMO as early as possible for assistance in performing the trade studies. When these evaluations have been completed, and the user desires to use TDRSS, the user should initiate a request for TDRSS service.</P>
            <P>(a) Initial requests for TDRSS service from non-U.S. Government users shall be addressed to SCaN at NASA Headquarters, as follows: Deputy Associate Administrator: Space Communications and Navigation Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scheduling user service.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) User service shall be scheduled only by NASA. TDRSS services will be provided in accordance with operational priorities established by the NASA Administrator or his/her designee. See Appendix A for a description of a typical user activity timeline.</P>
            <P>(b) Schedule conflict will be resolved in general by application of principles of priority to user service requirements. Services shall be provided either as normally scheduled service or as emergency service. Priorities will be different for emergency service than for normal services.</P>

            <P>(1) Normally scheduled service is service which is planned and ordered <PRTPAGE P="101"/>under normal operational conditions and is subject to schedule conflict resolution under normal service priorities. Requests for normally scheduled service must be received by the schedulers at the GSFC WSC Data Services Management Center (DSMC) no later than 21 days prior to the requested support time.</P>
            <P>(2) At times, emergency service requirements will override normal schedule priority. Under emergency service conditions, disruptions to scheduled service will occur.</P>
            <P>(3) The DSMC reserves the sole right to schedule, reschedule, or cancel TDRSS service.</P>
            <P>(4) NASA schedulers will exercise judgment and endeavor to see that lower-priority users are not excluded from a substantial portion of their contracted-for service due to the requirements of higher-priority users.</P>
            <P>(c) General user service requirements, which will be used for preliminary planning and mission modeling, should include all pertinent information necessary for NASA to determine if the proposed service is achievable. Contact NIMO to discuss usage and requirements.</P>
            <P>(d) Such user service requirements information typically includes:</P>
            <P>(1) Date of service initiation.</P>

            <P>(2) The type of TDRSS services desired (e.g., multiple access, tracking, <E T="03">etc.</E>), and the frequency and duration of each service.</P>
            <P>(3) Orbit or trajectory parameters and tracking data requirements.</P>
            <P>(4) Spacecraft events significant to tracking, telemetry or command requirements.</P>
            <P>(5) Communications systems specifics, including location of antennas and other related information dealing with user tracking, command, and data systems.</P>

            <P>(6) Special test requirements, data flows, and simulations, <E T="03">etc.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(7) Identification of terrestrial data transport requirements, interface points, and delivery locations, including latency and line loss recovery.</P>
            <P>(e) To provide for effective planning, reference Appendix A, Typical New User Activity Timeline.</P>

            <P>The user has the right to terminate its service contract with NASA at any time. A user who exercises this right after contracting for service shall pay the charge agreed upon for services previously rendered, and the cost incurred by the Government for support of pre-launch activities, services, and mission documentation not included in that charge.

            <P>The user may postpone the initiation of contracted service (e.g., user launch date) by delivery of written notification to NASA Headquarters, Code OX. Any delay in the contracted start of service date may affect the quantity of service to be provided due to commitments to other support requirements.

            <P>(b) For standard services, the user shall be charged only for services rendered, except that if a total cancellation of service occurs, the user shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of § 1215.110.</P>
            <P>(1) Standard services which are scheduled, and then cancelled by the user less than 72 hours prior to the start of that scheduled service period, will be charged as if the scheduled service actually occurred.</P>

            <P>(2) The time scheduled by the user project shall include the slew time, set up and/or configuration time, TDRSS contact time, and all other conditions <PRTPAGE P="102"/>for which TDRSS services were allocated to the user.</P>
            <P>(3) Charges will be accumulated by the minute, based on the computerized schedule/configuration messages which physically set up TDRSS equipment at the start of a support period and free the equipment for other users at the end of a support period.</P>
            <P>(c) The user shall reimburse NASA for the costs of any mission-unique services provided by NASA.</P>

            <P>(a) The procedure for billing and payment of standard TDRSS services is as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) NASA shall be reimbursed by customers in connection with the use of Government property and services provided under an approved reimbursable agreement. Advance payment for services is required. Advance payments shall be scheduled to keep pace with the rate at which NASA anticipates incurring costs. NASA will provide a Customer Budget/Estimate (CBE) for services rendered nominally 60-90 days in advance, or as otherwise agreed, of the first anticipated property use or required service date for each mission. The full cost of the mission shall be paid by the customer not later than 30 days prior to the first anticipated property use or required service date.</P>
            <P>(2) In some cases, an advance partial payment will be required six—nine months prior to the first anticipated property use or required service date in order for advance planning work and/or travel to take place. The amount of this partial payment and its receipt shall be negotiated on an as-needed basis. Adjustments to the amounts prepaid will be made to the succeeding billings as the actual services are rendered.</P>
            <P>(3) If the customer fails to make payment by the payment due date, NASA may terminate the agreement and any subagreements for breach of agreement after notice to the customer is given of this breach and failure to cure such breach within a time period established by NASA.</P>
            <P>(b) Late payments by the user will require the user to pay a late payment charge.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The NASA Senior Environmental Official (SEO) (as defined in Appendix A to this subpart) is responsible for overseeing and guiding NASA's integration of NEPA into the Agency's planning and decision making. The SEO, with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), is responsible for developing NASA NEPA regulations and maintaining up-to-date Agency-wide NEPA guidance that fully integrates NEPA analysis into Agency planning and decision-making processes. The SEO shall monitor this process to ensure that these regulations and the associated Agency guidance are achieving their purposes. In addition, the NASA SEO is responsible for coordinating with other Federal agencies and the CEQ and consolidating and transmitting NASA's comments on EISs and other NEPA documentation prepared by other Federal agencies:</P>

            <P>(1) The NASA Headquarters/Environmental Management Division (HQ/EMD) is delegated the SEO's overall responsibility of implementing NEPA functions and guiding NASA's integration of NEPA into the Agency's planning and decision making for all NASA activities. The HQ/EMD provides advice <PRTPAGE P="106"/>and consultation to all NASA entities in implementing their assigned responsibilities under NEPA. Interested persons can obtain information on the status of EISs and other elements of the NEPA process by contacting the NASA NEPA Manager at HQ/EMD identified at <E T="03">http://www.nasa.gov/agency/nepa/NEPATeam.html.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Each NASA Center has an environmental management office that guides and supports the working-level functions of the NEPA process, such as evaluating proposed actions; developing, reviewing, and approving required documentation; and advising project managers.</P>
            <P>(b) The Responsible Official shall ensure that planning and decision making for each proposed Agency action complies with these regulations and with Agency NEPA policy and guidance provided by the SEO, HQ/EMD, and the Center's environmental management office. For facility programs and projects, the Responsible Official is the individual responsible for establishing, developing, and maintaining the institutional capabilities required for the execution of programs and projects (e.g., Center Director, facility manager). For other programs and projects, (e.g., space flight programs/projects, R&amp;D programs/projects) the Responsible Official is the NASA official responsible for the formulation and implementation of the program or project (e.g., The Associate Administrator for Science Mission Directorate, Center Director).</P>
            <P>(c) NASA must comply with this subpart when considering issuance of a permit, lease, easement, or grant to a non-Federal party and may seek such non-Federal party's assistance in obtaining necessary information and completing the NEPA process. The Responsible Official(s) for such action(s), in consultation with HQ/EMD and/or the Center's environmental management office, will determine the type of environmental information needed from the non-Federal party and the extent of the non-Federal party's participation in the necessary NEPA process.</P>

            <SUBJECT>NEPA process in NASA planning and decision making.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NEPA requires the systematic examination of the environmental consequences of implementing a proposed Agency action. Full integration of the NEPA process with NASA project and program planning improves Agency decisions and ensures that:</P>
            <P>(1) Planning and decision making support NASA's strategic plan commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship and comply with applicable environmental statutes, regulations, and policies.</P>
            <P>(2) The public is appropriately engaged in the decision-making process.</P>
            <P>(3) Procedural risks and delays are minimized.</P>
            <P>(b) Determining the appropriate level of NEPA review and documentation for a proposed NASA action will depend upon the scope of the action and the context and intensity of the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.</P>
            <P>(c) The environmental impacts of a proposed Agency action must be considered, along with technical, economic, and other factors that are reasonably foreseeable, beginning in the early planning stage of a proposed action. NASA will take no action which would have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives prior to completion of its NEPA review.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Categorical Exclusions (CatExs) are categories of Agency actions with no individually or cumulatively significant impact on the human environment and for which neither an EA nor an EIS is required. The use of a CatEx is intended to reduce paperwork, improve Government efficiency, and eliminate delays in the initiation and completion of proposed actions having no significant impact.</P>

            <P>(b) A proposed action may be categorically excluded if the action fits within a category of actions eligible for exclusion (such categories are listed in paragraph (d) of this section)), and the proposed action does not involve any extraordinary circumstances as described in paragraph (c) of this section:<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) Extraordinary circumstances that will preclude the use of CatExs occur when the proposed action:</P>
            <P>(1) Has a reasonable likelihood of having (individually or cumulatively) significant impacts on public health, safety, or the environment.</P>
            <P>(2) Imposes uncertain or unique environmental risks.</P>
            <P>(3) Is of significantly greater scope or size than is normal for this category of action.</P>
            <P>(4) Has a reasonable likelihood of violating Federal, federally recognized Indian tribe, State, and/or local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.</P>
            <P>(5) Involves impacts on the quality of the environment that are likely to be environmentally controversial.</P>
            <P>(6) May adversely affect environmentally sensitive resources, such as, but not limited to, federally listed threatened or endangered species, their designated critical habitat, wilderness areas, floodplains, wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, coastal zones, wild and scenic rivers, and significant fish or wildlife habitat, unless the impact has been resolved through another environmental review process; e.g., the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).</P>
            <P>(7) May adversely affect known national natural landmarks, or cultural or historic resources, including, but not limited to, property listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, unless the impact has been resolved through another environmental review process; e.g., the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).</P>

          <P>This part sets forth policy and procedures with respect to the use of the NASA's authority to certify to the U.S. Commissioner of Customs duty-free entry of articles into the United States for the use of NASA or for implementation of a NASA international program, including articles that will be launched into space, spare parts for such articles, ground support equipment, or uniquely associated equipment for use in connection with a NASA international program or launch service agreement. This part also sets forth NASA's procedures with respect to the use of its authority to bring foreign-owned articles and articles from space into the customs territory of the United States, and describes the nonimport status of such articles.</P>

          <P>This part applies to qualifying articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption in the customs territory of the United States, and to articles brought into the customs territory of the United States by NASA from space or from foreign country as part of the NASA international program.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Background.</SUBJECT>
          <P>In order to encourage and facilitate the use of NASA's launch services for the exploration and use of space, section 116 of Public Law 97-446 provided for the duty-free entry into the United States of certain articles imported by NASA for its space-related activities or articles imported by another person or entity for the purpose of meeting its obligations under a launch services agreement with NASA. Such articles were certified by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs for duty-free entry to be launched into space or space parts or necessary and uniquely associated support equipment for use in connection with a launch into space. This exemption from duty was provided for in Subheading 9808.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). Also, HTSUS, Chapter VIII, U.S. note 1, pursuant to the same law, provided that return of articles by NASA from space to the United States would not be considered an importation, and similarly not be subject to a duty.</P>

          <P>As a result of the Uruguay Round agreements of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this authority was revised and expanded in scope. It now provides that imports of articles for NASA's use and articles imported to implement NASA's international programs, including articles to be launched into space, parts thereof, ground support equipment, and uniquely associated equipment for use in connection with NASA's international programs and launch service agreements would be eligible for duty-free customs entry upon certification by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs. The revised authorities also provided, in U.S. note 1 to subchapter VIII of chapter 98 of the HTSUS, that articles brought into the customs territory of the <PRTPAGE P="112"/>United States by NASA from space or from a foreign country as part of a NASA's international programs would not be considered imports or subject to customs entry requirements.</P>

          <SUBJECT>To what does this policy apply?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as detailed in § 1230.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.</P>
          <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>62</SU>

          </FTNT>

          <P>(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some <PRTPAGE P="125"/>or all of the requirements of this policy.</P>
          <P>(e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
          <P>(f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
          <P>(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.</P>

          <P>(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.</P>
          <P>(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>63</SU>

            <FTREF/> Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 1230.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 1230.103(d)).<PRTPAGE P="129"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</P>
          <P>(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.</P>
          <P>(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 1230.101(i) or exempted under § 1230.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.</P>

Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.</P>
          <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>
          <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>

          <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests <PRTPAGE P="130"/>(cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 1230.111(a)(7).</P>
          <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 1230.111(a)(7).</P>
          <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>
          <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>
          <P>(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;</P>
          <P>(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;</P>

          <P>(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or<PRTPAGE P="131"/>
          </P>

          <P>(iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
          <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
          <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

          <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>
          <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
          <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 1230.116.</P>
          <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 1230.117.</P>
          <P>(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
          <P>(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>

          <P>(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 1230.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 1230.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);</P>
          <P>(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 1230.117; and</P>
          <P>(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>

          <P>(a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research.</P>
          <P>(2) The following research is not subject to this provision:</P>
          <P>(i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or</P>
          <P>(ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.</P>
          <P>(c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Documentation of informed consent.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.</P>
          <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:</P>
          <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 1230.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>
          <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 1230.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 1230.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>
          <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
          <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>

          <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community <PRTPAGE P="141"/>in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
          <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1245.103</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In implementing the provisions of section 20135(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. Chapter 201), and in determining when the interests of the United States would be served by waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in an invention or class of inventions made in the performance of work under NASA contracts, the Administrator will be guided by the objectives set forth in the National Aeronautics and Space Act, by the basic policy of the Presidential Memorandum and Statement of Government Patent Policy to the Heads of the Executive Departments and agencies dated February 18, 1983, by the goals and objectives of its current Authorization Act, Strategic Plan, and other pertinent National policies or laws, such as the National Space Policy of the United States of America. Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Among the most important goals are to provide incentives to foster inventiveness and encourage the reporting of inventions made under NASA contracts, to provide for the widest practicable dissemination of new technology resulting from NASA programs, and to promote early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability of this new technology for commercial purposes and the public benefit. In applying this regulation, both the need for incentives to draw forth private initiatives and the need to promote healthy competition in industry must be weighed.</P>
            <P>(b) Several different situations arise when waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to an invention or class of invention may be requested and are prescribed in §§ 1245.104 through 1245.106. Under § 1245.104, advance waiver of any or all of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions which may be made under a contract may be requested prior to the execution of the contract, or within 30 days after execution of the contract. Waiver of rights to an identified invention made and reported under a contract are to be requested under § 1245.105, and may be requested under this provision even though a request under § 1245.104 was not made, or if made, was not granted. Waiver of foreign rights under § 1245.106 may be requested concurrently with domestic rights under § 1245.104 or § 1245.105, or may be made independently.</P>
            <P>(c) With respect to inventions which may be or are made or conceived in the course of or under contracts for research, development or demonstration work awarded by NASA on behalf of the Department of Energy (DOE) or in support of a DOE program, on a reimbursable basis pursuant to agreement between DOE and NASA, the waiver policy, regulations, and procedures of DOE will be applied. NASA will normally grant waiver of rights to inventions made under contracts awarded by NASA on behalf of, or in support of, programs funded by another Government agency, unless the funding agency recommends and justifies denial of the waiver. See §§ 1245.110(c) and 1245.111(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Advance waivers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of domestic rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions which may be made under a contract.</P>

            <P>(b) The NASA Inventions and Contributions Board normally will recommend grant of a request for advance waiver of domestic rights submitted <PRTPAGE P="150"/>prior to execution of contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract unless the Board finds that the interests of the United States will be better served by restricting or denying all or part of the requested rights in one or more of the following situations:</P>
            <P>(1) When the contractor is not located in the United States or does not have a place of business in the United States or is subject to the control of a foreign government;</P>
            <P>(2) When a determination has been made by Government authority which is authorized by statute or Executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or counter-intelligence activities that the restriction or denial of the requested rights to any inventions made in the performance of work under the contract is necessary to protect the security of such activities; or</P>
            <P>(3) Where the Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such that restriction or denial of the requested rights will better promote one or more of the following objectives:</P>
            <P>(i) Promoting the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research and development;</P>
            <P>(ii) Encouraging maximum participation of industry in federally-supported research and development;</P>
            <P>(iii) Ensuring that inventions are used in a manner to promote free competition and enterprise;</P>
            <P>(iv) Promoting the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States industry and labor; and</P>
            <P>(v) Ensuring that the Government retains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) An advance waiver, when granted, will be subject to the reservations set forth in § 1245.107. Normally, the reservations of § 1245.107(a), License to the Government, and § 1245.107(b), March-in rights, will apply. However, should one or more of the situations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3), of this section exist, rather than denying the advance waiver request, the Board may recommend granting to the contractor only part of the requested rights, to the extent necessary to address the particular situation, consistent with the policy and goals of § 1245.103. In that event, the waiver grant will be subject to additional reservations as provided for in § 1245.107(c).</P>
            <P>(2) To meet the National Aeronautics and Space Act standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” for advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention(s) and/or class(es) of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver of rights is being requested. Therefore, the petition must be directed to a specific invention(s) or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly drawn, focused area(s) of technology.</P>
            <P>(3) An advance waiver, when granted, will apply only to inventions reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and a designation made within 6 months of the time of reporting (or a reasonable time thereafter permitted for good cause shown) that the contractor elects title to the invention and intends to file or has filed a U.S. patent application. Such election will be made by notification in writing to the patent representative designated in the contract. Title to all other inventions made under the contract are subject to section 20135(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 51 U.S.C. 20135(b)(1). The granting of the advance waiver does not otherwise relieve a contractor of any of the invention identification or reporting requirements set forth in the applicable patent rights clause in the contract.</P>
            <P>(4) The advance waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in any patent application filed on the reported invention, including any subsequent divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the claims of the subsequent application do not substantially change the scope of the reported invention.</P>

            <P>(d) When a petition for waiver is submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, prior to contract execution, it will be processed expeditiously so that a decision on the petition may be reached prior to execution of the contract. However, if there is insufficient <PRTPAGE P="151"/>time or insufficient information is presented, or for other reasons which do not permit a recommendation to be made without unduly delaying execution of the contract, the Board will inform the contracting officer that no recommendation can be made prior to contract execution and the reasons therefor. The contracting officer will then notify the petitioner of the Board's action.</P>
            <P>(e) A waiver granted pursuant to a petition submitted under this section shall extend to any contract changes, modifications, or supplemental agreements, so long as the purpose of the contract or the scope of work to be performed is not substantially changed.</P>

            <P>(a) The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of domestic rights to identified inventions which have been reported to NASA and to which a waiver of rights has not been granted pursuant to § 1245.104.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) When an individual identified invention has been reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and waiver of rights has not been granted under § 1245.104, the Board normally will recommend grant of a request for waiver of domestic rights to such invention if the request is received within 8 months of first disclosure to NASA (or such longer period that the Board may permit for good cause shown), unless the Board finds that one or more of the situations set forth in § 1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v) exist. When granted, the waiver will be subject to the reservations set forth in § 1245.107 in the same manner as discussed in § 1245.104(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) The waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in the patent application filed on the reported invention, including any subsequent divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the claims of the subsequent application do not substantially change the scope of the reported invention.</P>

            <P>(a) The Board will consider the waiver of foreign rights in any designated country concurrently with the waiver of domestic rights when so requested under § 1245.104 or § 1245.105.</P>
            <P>(b) The Board will also consider a separate request for foreign rights for an individual identified invention in any designated country if a request was not made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or for countries not designated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) The Board will normally recommend the waiver of foreign rights be granted under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section in any designated country unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such that restriction or denial of the requested foreign rights will better promote one or more of the objectives set forth in § 1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v); or</P>
            <P>(2) The Board finds that the economic interests of the United States will not be served thereby; or unless</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of an individual identified invention under paragraph (b) of this section, NASA has determined, prior to the request, to file a patent application in the designated country.</P>
            <P>(d) If, subsequent to the granting of the petition for foreign rights, the petitioner requests and designates additional countries in which it wishes to secure patents, the Chairperson may recommend such request, in whole or in part, without further action by the Board.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">March-in rights.</E> For any invention for which waiver of rights has been granted under this subpart, NASA has the same right as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210, with the procedures set <PRTPAGE P="152"/>forth in § 1245.117 and 37 CFR 401.6, to require the contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of the invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, NASA has the right to grant such a license itself if NASA determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in such field of use;</P>
            <P>(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their licensees;</P>
            <P>(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or</P>
            <P>(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by the “Preference for United States industry” has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional reservations.</E> In the event one or more of the situations set forth in § 1245.104 (b)(1) through (b)(3) exist, the Board may determine to recommend partial grant of the waiver request (rather than denial) by making the grant subject to additional reservations (than those set forth in (a) and (b) of this section) to the extent necessary to address the particular situation. Such additional reservations may include, but not be limited to, field-of-use or terrestrial-use limitations, or additions to the march-in rights.</P>

            <P>(a) Each contractor reporting an invention is granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on the invention and in any resulting patent in which the Government acquires title. The license extends to the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right is transferable only with the approval of the Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.</P>
            <P>(b) The contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with the Licensing of Government-Owned Inventions (37 CFR part 404). This license will not be revoked in that field of use and/or the geographical areas in which the contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention available to the public on reasonable terms. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the Administrator to the extent the contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</P>
            <P>(c) Before revocation or modification of the license, the contractor will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the contractor will be allowed 30 days (or any other time as may be allowed by the Administrator for good cause shown by the contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The contractor shall have the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.</P>

            <P>(c) In any country in which the waiver recipient decides not to continue prosecution of any application, to pay maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceedings on a patent on a waived invention, the waiver recipient shall notify the patent representative within sufficient time for NASA to continue prosecution, pay the maintenance fee or defend the reexamination or opposition, and upon written request, convey title to NASA and execute all papers necessary for NASA to proceed with the appropriate action.</P>

Indicate whether the patent has been the subject of any interference proceedings, certification of correction request, reexamination, or reissue proceedings at the USPTO, or lapsed for failure to pay any maintenance fee. In addition, the status of all corresponding foreign patents and patent applications and full copies of the same.</P>
            <P>(11) Pertinent prior art known to the claimant not contained in the USPTO file, for example, publications and foreign prior art. In addition to the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that the investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused article(s) or process(es) or to a specific acquisition (e.g. identified contract(s)), it may speed disposition of the claim. Claimants are also encouraged to provide information on any ancillary matters that may have a bearing on validity or infringement.</P>

            <P>(a) Pursuant to § 1245.113, NASA has facilitated the filing of foreign patent applications by contractors by providing for the granting of a waiver of title to a contractor to any identified invention in countries other than the United States in the event the Administrator of NASA does not desire to file a patent application covering the invention in such countries. However, any such waiver is subject to the reservation by the Administrator of the license required to be retained by NASA under 51 U.S.C. 20135(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, as amended.</P>
            <P>(b) Conversely, where the principal rights in an invention made under a NASA contract remain in the contractor by virtue of waiver, § 1245.19(a)(5) provides that the contractor, upon written request, will convey to the Administrator of NASA the entire right, title, and interest in the invention in any foreign country in which the contractor has elected not to file a patent application.</P>
            <P>(c) With respect to inventions in which NASA has acquired and retained the principal rights, NASA will file patent applications in countries other than the United States on inventions selected in accordance with the criteria set forth in § 1245.303.</P>

            <P>(a) The patent counsel at each NASA field installation will review all invention disclosures at the time of docketing and will expedite the processing and preparation of a U.S. patent application, if justified, on those inventions which appear to fall within the criteria set forth in § 1245.303. The patent counsel will make a recommendation as to whether or not foreign patent coverage appears justified at the time of assigning a priority evaluation to a disclosed invention.</P>
            <P>(b) Preparation and filing of patent applications in foreign countries will be subject to approval of the Assistant General Counsel for Patent Matters, NASA Headquarters.</P>

This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practices or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purpose of the Act.</P>

          <P>(a) In training grant services discrimination is forbidden in the selection or eligibility of individuals to be trained and in their treatment by the grantee during their training. In any case where selection is made from a predetermined group, such as the students in an institution, the group must have been selected without discrimination.</P>
          <P>(b) In a research or training grant to a university for activities to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited and the prohibition extends to the entire university.</P>
          <P>(c) Discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.</P>
          <P>(d) In a research or training grant, discrimination is prohibited with respect to the availability of any educational activity and any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the grant.</P>
          <P>(e) Upon transfers of real or personal property for research or educational uses, discrimination is forbidden to the same extent as in the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision of equipment for like purposes.</P>
          <P>(f) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 1250.105 to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.</P>
          <P>(g) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.</P>

If the assurance is not made a part of the application, the application shall identify the assurance which is applicable to the application. One assurance shall suffice for all applications of an applicant if the assurance complies with the conditions made applicable by this part to each such application for Federal financial assistance. Every assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Duration of assurances.</E> The period of time to be covered by the assurances required under this § 1250.104 shall be as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Real property.</E> In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance for providing real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Personal property.</E> In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance for providing personal property, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Other kinds of Federal financial assistance.</E> In the case of an application for any other kind of Federal financial assistance, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Assurances for research, training, or educational programs.</E> (1) In the case of application by an institution of higher education or any other organization for Federal financial assistance for a program or activity which involves participation by students, fellows or trainees, including but not limited to assistance for research, training, or the provision of facilities, the assurance required by this § 1250.104 shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students or other participants.</P>
          <P>(2) The assurances from such an applicant shall be applicable to the entire organization of the applicant.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Assurances for construction of facilities.</E> In the case of assistance for the construction of a facility, or part thereof, the assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith. In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision of research, training, or educational services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be forbidden as a condition of grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students. Also, see paragraph (c) of this section for the requirement as to the applicability of the assurance to the applicant's organization.<PRTPAGE P="166"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Instrument effecting or recording transfers of real property.</E> The instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible NASA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Assurances for transfer of surplus real property.</E> Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Form of assurances.</E> The responsible NASA officials shall specify the form of assurances required by this § 1250.104 and the extent to which like assurances will be required by subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Requests for proposals.</E> Any request for proposals issued by NASA which relates to covered financial assistance listed in appendix A shall have set forth therein or have attached thereto the assurance prescribed in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and shall require that the proposer either include the assurance as a part of his signed proposal or identify and refer to an assurance already signed and submitted by the proposer.</P>

The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues.

          <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of a hearing officer or the Principal Compliance Officer shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval by administrator.</E> Any final decision of the NASA Principal Compliance Officer which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Administrator, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its non-compliance and satisfies the Principal Compliance Officer that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Post termination proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.</P>
          <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the Principal Compliance Officer to restore fully the eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Principal Compliance Officer determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>
          <P>(3) If the Principal Compliance Officer denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the Principal Compliance Officer. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part effectuates section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is designed to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Broad scope of coverage.</E> Consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008's purpose (ADA Amendments Act) of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA and section 504, the definition of “disability” applicable to this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this part. The primary object of attention in cases brought under this part should be whether entities covered under section 504 have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.</P>

            <P>(3) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that no individual with disability is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance because of the absence of auxiliary aids for individuals with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the Agency to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance of historic properties.</P>

            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1251.550(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by <PRTPAGE P="187"/>a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1251.550(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1251.550(a)(2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;</P>
            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
            <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1251.560 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <P>The purpose of these regulations is to set out NASA's policies and to implement agencywide or agency procedures under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 according to the government-wide age discrimination regulations at 45 CFR part 90. (Published at 44 FR 33768, June 12, 1979.) The Act and the government-wide regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act and the governmentwide regulations permit federally assisted programs or activities and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and the governmentwide regulations.</P>

            <P>(1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms <E T="03">normal operation</E> and <E T="03">statutory objective</E> shall have the following meaning:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Normal operation</E> means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its objectives.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Statutory objective</E> means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal statute, state statute or local statute or ordinance adopted by any elected, general purpose legislative body.</P>
            <P>(b) Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 1252.200 if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation of the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:</P>
            <P>(1) Age is used as a measure of approximation of one or more other characteristics; and</P>
            <P>(2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and</P>
            <P>(3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and</P>
            <P>(4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.</P>

            <P>(c) Reasonable factors other than age. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by <PRTPAGE P="193"/>§ 1252.200 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.</P>

A complaint must be filed within 180 days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, NASA may extend this time limit.</P>
            <P>(b) NASA will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures:</P>
            <P>(1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement, which identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action or practice complained of, and assigned by the complainant.</P>

            <P>(2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.</P>
            <P>(b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at least one meeting with the mediator before NASA will accept a judgment that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.</P>
            <P>(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to NASA. NASA will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.

            <P>(2) As part of the initial inquiry, NASA will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and <PRTPAGE P="195"/>recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. NASA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.</P>
            <P>(3) NASA will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official at NASA.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Formal investigation.</E> If NASA cannot resolve the complaint through informal means it will develop formal findings through further investigations of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, NASA will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. If NASA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin enforcement as described in § 1252.405.</P>

The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from NASA.</P>

            <P>(b) NASA will limit any termination under § 1252.405(a)(1) to the particular program or activity NASA finds in violations of these regulations. NASA will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from NASA.</P>
            <P>(c) NASA will take no action under paragraph (a) until:</P>
            <P>(1) The Administrator has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.</P>
            <P>(2) 30 days have elapsed after the Administrator has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Administrator will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) NASA also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from NASA to a recipient when a hearing under § 1252.405(a)(1) is initiated.</P>
            <P>(1) New Federal financial assistance from NASA includes all assistance for which NASA requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from NASA does not include assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under § 1252.405(a)(1).</P>

            <P>(2) NASA will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 1252.405(a)(1). NASA will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the <PRTPAGE P="196"/>hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Administrator. NASA will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Time limitations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A claim may be allowed only if the claim is presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. For the purposes of this subpart, a claim accrues at the time of the accident or incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage is or should have been discovered by the claimant through the exercise of due diligence.</P>

            <P>(b) If a claim accrues in time of war or if an armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after that cause ceases to exist, or 2 years after the war or armed conflict is terminated, whichever is earlier. The dates of beginning and ending of such an <PRTPAGE P="222"/>armed conflict are the dates established by concurrent resolution of the Congress or by a determination of the President.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allowable claims.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A claim may be allowed only if:</P>
            <P>(1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, the claimant's agent, private employee, or family member (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances);</P>
            <P>(2) The possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and</P>
            <P>(3) The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.</P>
            <P>(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this subpart shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.</P>
            <P>(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with NASA may be considered and allowed.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In addition to the information required on NASA Form 1204, and any other evidence required by the Administrator or designee, the claimant will furnish the following evidence when relevant:</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1261.108</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Recovery from carriers, insurers, and other third parties.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> NASA is not an insurer and does not underwrite all personal property losses that an employee may sustain. Employees are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from NASA. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of compensation for personal property loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Demand on carrier, contractor, warehouse owner/operator, or insurer.</E> When it appears that property has been damaged or lost under circumstances in which a carrier, warehouse owner/operator, contractor or insurer may be responsible, the claimant shall make a written demand on such party, either before or after submitting a claim against NASA. The Administrator or designee, if requested, will assist in making demand on the third party. No such demand need be made if, in the opinion of the Administrator or designee, it would be impracticable or any recovery would be insignificant, or if circumstances preclude the claimant from making timely demand.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Action subsequent to demand.</E> A copy of the demand and of any related correspondence shall be submitted to the Administrator or designee. If the carrier, insurer, or other third party offers a settlement which is less than the amount of the demand, the claimant shall consult with the Administrator or designee before accepting the amount offered. The claimant shall also notify the Administrator or designee promptly of any other action by a third party, including settlement, partial settlement, or denial of liability.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of recovery.</E> When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this subpart, no compensation is allowable under this subpart. When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of total loss subject to the maximum set forth in § 1261.102.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Transfer of rights.</E> The claimant shall assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment accepted on a claim, all rights, title, and interest in any claim he/she may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the accident or incident on which the claim against the United States is based. The claimant shall also, upon request, furnish such evidence and other cooperation as may be required to enable the United States to enforce the claim. After payment on the claim by the United States, the claimant shall, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier, insurer, or other party, notify the Administrator or designee and pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent required under the provisions of paragraph (d).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1261.109</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Computation of allowance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The amount allowed for damage to or loss of any item of property may not exceed the cost of the item (either the price paid in cash or property, or the value at the time of acquisition if not acquired by purchase or exchange). There will be no allowance for replacement cost or for appreciation in the value of the property. Subject to these limitations, the amount allowable is either:</P>
            <P>(1) The depreciated value, immediately prior to the loss or damage of property lost or damaged beyond economical repair, less any salvage value; or</P>

            <P>(a) The submission of, and action by NASA upon, claims against the United States arising out of the activities of NASA for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or death, and designates the NASA officials authorized to act upon such claims.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authority.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended (see 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680), and subject to its limitations, the Administrator or designee is authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any NASA employee while acting within the scope of his/her office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. In exercising such authority, the Administrator or designee is required to act in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General (28 CFR part 14). An award, compromise, <PRTPAGE P="226"/>or settlement in excess of $25,000 may be effected only with the prior written approval of the Attorney General or designee.</P>
            <P>(b) Under 51 U.S.C. 20113(m)(1), NASA is authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, settle, and pay, on behalf of the United States, in full satisfaction thereof, any claim for $25,000 or less against the United States for bodily injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property resulting from the conduct of NASA's functions as specified in 51 U.S.C. 20112. At the discretion of NASA, a claim may be settled and paid under this authority even though the United States could not be held legally liable to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(c) Under 51 U.S.C. 20113(m)(2), if NASA considers that a claim in excess of $25,000 is meritorious and would otherwise be covered by 51 U.S.C. 20113(m)(1), NASA may report the facts and circumstances of the claim to the Congress for its consideration or to the Comptroller General as provided in the “Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1978,” Public Law 95-240 (92 Stat. 107), 31 U.S.C. 724a.</P>
            <P>(d) Under 28 U.S.C. 2679, the Attorney General of the United States shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against a Government employee for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death, resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle by the Government employee while acting within the scope of office or employment. In effect, this legislation is designed to protect an employee driving a motor vehicle on Government business by converting such a civil court action or proceeding against the employee into a claim against the United States: Provided, That the employee was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the accident. The remedy against the United States provided by 28 U.S.C. 2672 (administrative adjustment of claims) and 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) (civil action against the United States) then becomes the plaintiff's exclusive remedy.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Demand for payment; limitation periods.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Appropriate written demands shall be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals will normally be made unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that a further demand would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. In determining the timing of demand letters, NASA will give due regard to the need to act promptly so that, as a general rule, if necessary to refer the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation, such referral can be made within one year of the agency's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. When necessary to protect the Government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions, including immediate referral for litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) The initial demand letter should inform the debtor of:</P>
            <P>(1) The basis for the indebtedness and whatever rights the debtor may have to seek review within the agency;</P>
            <P>(2) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrative costs (§ 1261.412); and</P>

            <P>(3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should be not more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter was mailed or hand delivered. The responsible official should exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand delivered on the same day that they are actually dated. Apart from these requirements, there is no prescribed format for demand letters. However, as appropriate to the circumstances, the responsible official may consider including, either in the initial demand letter or in subsequent letters, such items the <PRTPAGE P="233"/>NASA's willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment, or intentions with respect to referral of the debt to the Department of Justice for litigation.</P>
            <P>(4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within the Agency.</P>
            <P>(c) NASA should respond promptly to communications from the debtor, within 30 days whenever feasible, and should advise debtors who dispute the debt to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.</P>
            <P>(d) If either prior to the initiation of, any time during, or after completion of the demand cycle, a determination to pursue offset is made, then the procedures specified in subparts 1261.5 and 1261.6, as applicable, should be followed. The availability of funds for offset and NASA's determination to pursue it release the agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. If the agency has not already sent the first demand letter, the agency's written notification of its intent to offset must give the debtor the opportunity to make voluntary payment, a requirement which will be satisfied by compliance with the notice requirements of § 1261.502 or § 1261.603(a), as applicable.</P>
            <P>(e) NASA should undertake personal interviews with its debtors whenever this is feasible, having regard for the amounts involved and the proximity of agency representatives to such debtors; and may attempt to effect compromise of the claim in accordance with § 1261.414.</P>
            <P>(f) When a debtor is employed by the Federal government or is a member of the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by offset cannot be accomplished in accordance with subpart 1261.6, the employing agency will be contacted for the purpose of arranging with the debtor for payment of the indebtedness by allotment or otherwise in accordance with section 206 of Executive Order 11222, May 8, 1965, 30 FR 6469, which provides that: “An employee is expected to meet all just financial obligations, especially those—such as Federal, State, or local taxes—which are imposed by law” (4 CFR 102.81).</P>

            <P>(1) A consumer reporting agency as that term is defined in section 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f); or</P>
            <P>(2) A person that, for money or on a cooperative basis, regularly—</P>

            <P>(ii) Serves as a marketing agent under an arrangement allowing a third party to get the information from a consumer reporting agency.</P>
            <P>(b) NASA Headquarters Financial Management Division, shall be the focal contact between NASA and consumer reporting agencies. The following procedures shall apply when such agencies are employed by NASA:</P>
            <P>(1) After the appropriate notice pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) has been published, NASA may disclose, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12), information about a debtor to a consumer reporting agency. Such information may include:</P>
            <P>(i) That a claim has been determined to be valid and is overdue (including violation by debtor of a repayment plan or other claim settlement agreement);</P>

            <P>(ii) If a current address is available, notifying the individual by certified mail, return receipt requested, that: The designated NASA official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid and overdue; within not less than 60 days after sending this notice, NASA intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency the specific information to be disclosed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section; the individual may request a complete explanation of the claim, dispute the information in the records of NASA about the claim, and file for an administrative review or repeal of the claim or for <PRTPAGE P="234"/>reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.</P>
            <P>(iii) Amount, status, and history of the claim;</P>
            <P>(iv) Program or pertinent activity under which the claim arose.</P>
            <P>(2) Before disclosing the information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, NASA shall comply with 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) by:</P>
            <P>(i) Taking reasonable action to locate the individual if a current address is not available;</P>
            <P>(ii) If a current address is available, noticing the individual by certified mail, return receipt requested, that: The designated NASA official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid and overdue; within not less than 60 days after sending this notice, NASA intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency the specific information to be disclosed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section; the individual may request a complete explanation of the claim, dispute the information in the records of NASA about the claim, and file for an administrative review or repeal of the claim or for reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.</P>
            <P>(3) If an administrative review or reconsideration is requested, the responsible official or designee shall refer the request to the appropriate NASA legal counsel for an impartial review and determination by counsel or designee based on the entire written record. If the reviewer cannot resolve the question of indebtedness based upon the available documentary evidence, verified written statements by the debtor or the responsible official may be requested on any pertinent matter not addressed by the available record.</P>
            <P>(c) If the information is to be submitted to a consumer reporting agency, the responsible official shall obtain a verified statement from such agency which gives satisfactory assurances that the particular agency is complying with all laws of the United States related to providing consumer credit information; and thereafter ensure that the consumer reporting agency is promptly informed of any substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim, or, on request of such agency, promptly verify or correct information about the claim.</P>

            <P>(5) The debt must not be subject to mandatory transfer to the Department of the Treasury for collection. See 31 CFR 901.5(a) and (b).</P>

            <P>(a) In seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts <PRTPAGE P="235"/>provided for as an enforcement aid or for compelling compliance, NASA will give serious consideration to the suspension or revocation of licenses or other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated failure of a debtor to pay such a claim. In the case of a contractor under 48 CFR chapter 18, NASA will comply with the debarment, suspension, and ineligibility requirements of the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NASA/FAR Supplement) at 48 CFR 1809.4. Likewise, in making, guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in loans, NASA will give serious consideration to suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, broker, borrower, or other debtor from doing further business with it or engaging in programs sponsored by it if such a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time. The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 must be reported to the Treasury Department at once. Notification that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the Federal Government has been revoked or forfeited by the Treasury Department will be forwarded by that Department to all interested agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) If NASA is holding security or collateral which may be liquidated and the proceeds applied on debts due it through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a nonjudicial foreclosure, it should do so by such procedures if the debtor fails to pay the debt within a reasonable time after demand, unless the cost of disposing of the collateral will be disproportionate to its value or special circumstances require judicial foreclosure. NASA will provide the debtor with reasonable notice of the sale, an accounting of any surplus proceeds, and any other procedures required by applicable contract or law. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety or insurance concern unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Collection in installments.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Whenever feasible, and except as otherwise provided by law, debts owed to the United States, together with interest penalties, and administrative costs as required by § 1261.412, should be collected in full in one lump sum. This is true whether the debt is being collected by administrative offset or by another method, including voluntary payment. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. Debtors who represent that they are unable to pay the debt in one lump sum must submit justification, including financial statements. If NASA agrees to accept payment in regular installments, it will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor which specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and which contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the Government's claim in not more than three years. Installment payments of less than $50 per month should be accepted only if justifiable on the grounds of financial hardship or similar reasonable cause. If the claim is unsecured, an executed confess-judgment note should be obtained from a debtor when the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750. Such notes may be sought when an unsecured obligation of a lesser amount is involved. When attempting to obtain confess-judgment notes, the debtor should be provided with written explanation of the consequences of signing the note, and documentation should be maintained sufficient to demonstrate that the debtor has signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Security for deferred payments other than a confess-judgment note may be accepted in appropriate cases. NASA, at its option, may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of a debtor to execute a confess-judgment note or to give other security.<PRTPAGE P="236"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment payment is to be applied as among those debts, that designation must be followed. If the debtor does not designate the application of the payment, agencies should apply payments to the various debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, NASA shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States. Before assessing these charges, NASA must mail or hand deliver a written notice to the debtor explaining the requirements concerning the charges (see § 1261.407(b)).</P>
            <P>(b) Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt and the interest requirements is first mailed or hand delivered to the debtor (on or after October 25, 1982), using the most current address that is available to the agency. If an “advance billing” procedure is used—that is, a bill is mailed before the debt is actually owed—it can include the required interest notification in the advance billing, but interest may not start to accrue before the debt is actually owed. Designated officials should exercise care to ensure that the notices required by this section are dated and mailed or hand delivered on the same day.</P>

            <P>(c) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. NASA may assess a higher rate of interest if it reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States. The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except that where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, NASA may set a new interest rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury Department at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest should not be assessed on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. However, if the debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges which accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal to be paid under a new repayment agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) NASA shall assess against a debtor charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt—that is, the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent as defined in § 1261.401(b). Calculations of administrative costs should be based upon actual costs incurred or upon cost analyses establishing an average of actual additional costs incurred by the agency in processing and handling claims against other debtors in similar stages of delinquency. Administrative costs may include costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private debt collector, to the extent they are attributable to delinquency.</P>
            <P>(e) NASA shall assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 percent a year, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent as defined in § 1261.401(b) for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.</P>
            <P>(f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.</P>

            <P>(g) NASA must waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. NASA may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines that such action <PRTPAGE P="237"/>is appropriate. Also, NASA may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of interest, penalties, and/or administrative costs (assessed under this section) under the criteria specified in § 1261.414 relating to the compromise of claims (without regard to the amount of the debt), or if NASA determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interests of the United States. See 4 CFR 101.13(g). Such optional waivers should be handled on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with officials designated under § 1261.403. Examples of situations in which NASA may consider waiving interest and other related charges are:</P>
            <P>(1) Pending consideration of a request for reconsideration or administrative review;</P>
            <P>(2) Acceptance of an installment plan or other compromise agreement, where there is no indication of lack of good faith on the part of the debtor in not repaying the debt, and the debtor has provided substantiating information of inability to pay or other unavoidable hardship which reasonably prevented the debt from being repaid.</P>
            <P>(h) Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which collection action must be suspended under § 1261.416(c)(3).</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> (1) The provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3717 do not apply:</P>
            <P>(i) To debts owed by any State or local government;</P>
            <P>(ii) To debts arising under contracts which were executed prior to, and were in effect on (i.e., were not completed as of) October 25, 1982;</P>
            <P>(iii) To debts where an applicable statute, regulation required by statute, loan agreement, or contract either prohibits such charges or explicitly fixes the charges that apply to the debts involved; or</P>
            <P>(iv) To debts arising under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code, or the tariff laws of the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) NASA may, however, assess interest and related charges on debts which are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory authority.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Compromise of claims.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Designated NASA officials (see §§ 1261.402 and 1261.403) may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the activities of the Agency where the claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000, prior to the referral of such claims to the Government Accountability Office, or to the Department of Justice for litigation. The Comptroller General may exercise such compromise authority with respect to claims referred to the Government Accountability Office prior to their further referral for litigation. Only the Comptroller General may effect the compromise of a claim that arises out of an exception made by the Government Accountability Office in the account of an accountable officer, including a claim against the payee, prior to its referral by the Government Accountability Office for litigation.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) When the claim, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests solely with the Department of Justice. NASA should evaluate the offer, using the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, and may recommend compromise for reasons under one, or more than one, of those paragraphs. If NASA then wishes to accept the compromise, it must refer the matter to the Department of Justice, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. See § 1261.417(e) or 31 CFR 904.2(c). Claims for which the gross amount is over $200,000 shall be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. The referral should specify the reasons for the Agency's recommendation. If NASA has a debtor's firm written offer of compromise which is substantial in amount and the Agency is uncertain as to whether the offer should be accepted, it may refer the offer, the supporting data, and particulars concerning the claim to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice. The Government Accountability Office or the Department of Justice may act upon such an offer or return it to the agency with instructions or advice. If NASA wishes to reject the compromise, Government Accountability Office or Department of Justice approval is not required.</P>
            <P>(c) A claim may be compromised pursuant to this section if NASA cannot collect the full amount because of the debtor's inability to pay the full amount within a reasonable time, or the refusal of the debtor to pay the claim in full and the Government's inability to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings. In determining the debtor's inability or refusal to pay, the following factors, among others, may be considered:</P>
            <P>(1) Age and health of the debtor;</P>
            <P>(2) Present and potential income;</P>
            <P>(3) Inheritance prospects;</P>
            <P>(4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor;</P>
            <P>(5) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings; and</P>
            <P>(6) The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other property will bring at forced sale may properly be considered in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. The compromise should be for an amount which bears a reasonable relation to the amount which can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, having regard for the exemptions available to the debtor and the time which collection will take.</P>
            <P>(d) A claim may be compromised if there is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases should fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal question involved, the probabilities with respect to full or partial recovery of a judgment, paying due regard to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government claim, and related pragmatic considerations. In determining the litigative risks involved, proportionate weight should be given to the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act which may be assessed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation. See 28 U.S.C. 2412.</P>

            <P>(e) A claim may be compromised if the cost of collecting the claim does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, paying heed to the time which it will take to effect collection. Costs of collecting may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small claims, but normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of large <PRTPAGE P="239"/>claims. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced collection of the full amount, it is legitimate to consider the positive effect that enforced collection of some claims may have on the collection of other claims. Since debtors are more likely to pay when first requested to do so if an agency has a policy of vigorous collection of all claims, the fact that the cost of collection of any one claim may exceed the amount of the claim does not necessarily mean that the claim should be compromised. The practical benefits of vigorous collection of a small claim may include a demonstration to other debtors that resistance to payment is not likely to succeed.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Enforcement policy.</E> Statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance may be compromised pursuant to this part if the agency's enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, both present and future, will be adequately served by acceptance of the sum to be agreed upon. Mere accidental or technical violations may be dealt with less severely than willful and substantial violations.</P>
            <P>(g) Compromises payable in installments are to be discouraged. However, if payment of a compromise by installments is necessary, a legally enforceable agreement for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness less sums paid thereon and acceleration of the balance due upon default in the payment of any installment should be obtained, together with security in the manner set forth in § 1261.411, in every case in which this is possible.</P>
            <P>(h) If the agency's files do not contain reasonably up-to-date credit information as a basis for assessing a compromise proposal, such information may be obtained from the individual debtor by obtaining a statement executed under penalty of perjury showing the debtor's assets and liabilities, income, and expenses. Forms such as Department of Justice Form OBD-500 or OBD-500B may be used for this purpose. Similar data may be obtained from corporate debtors using a form such as Department of Justice Form OBD-500C or by resort to balance sheets and such additional data as seems required. Samples of the Department of Justice forms are available from the Office of the NASA General Counsel. Neither a percentage of a debtor's profits nor stock in a debtor corporation will be accepted in compromise of a claim. In negotiating a compromise with a business concern, consideration should be given to requiring a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Joint and several liability.</E> When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, collection action will not be withheld against one such debtor until the other or others pay their proportionate shares. NASA will not attempt to allocate the burden of paying such claims as between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible. Care should be taken that a compromise agreement with one such debtor does not release the agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one such debtor shall not be considered a precedent or as morally binding in determining the amount which will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.</P>

            <P>Upon receipt of full payment of a claim, or the amount in compromise of a claim as determined pursuant to § 1261.414, the official designated in § 1261.402 will prepare and execute, on behalf of the United States, an appropriate release, which shall include the provision that it shall be void if procured by fraud, misrepresentation, the presentation of a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Suspending or terminating collection action.\</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The standards set forth in this section apply to the suspension or termination of collection action pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(3) on claims which do not exceed $100,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. NASA may suspend or terminate collection action under this part with respect to claims for money or property <PRTPAGE P="240"/>arising out of activities of the Agency, prior to the referral of such claims to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice for litigation. The Comptroller General (or designee) may exercise such authority with respect to claims referred to the Government Accountability Office prior to their further referral for litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) If, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any, a claim exceeds $100,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the Department of Justice. If the designated official believes suspension or termination may be appropriate, the matter should be evaluated using the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. If the Agency concludes that suspension or termination is appropriate, it must refer the matter, with its reasons for the recommendation, to the Department of Justice, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. See § 1261.417(e) or 31 CFR 904.2(c). If NASA decides not to suspend or terminate collection action on the claim, Department of Justice approval is not required; or if it determines that its claim is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, it may terminate collection action regardless of the amount involved, without the need for Department of Justice concurrence.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Suspension of collection activity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Inability to locate debtor.</E> Collection action may be suspended temporarily on a claim when the debtor cannot be located after diligent effort and there is reason to believe that future collection action may be sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the claim, with due consideration for the size and amount which may be realized thereon. The following sources may be of assistance in locating missing debtors: Telephone directories; city directories; postmasters; drivers' license records; automobile title and registration records; state and local government agencies; the Internal Revenue Service (see 4 CFR 102.18); other Federal agencies; employers, relatives, friends; credit agency skip locate reports, and credit bureaus. Suspension as to a particular debtor should not defer the early liquidation cf security for the debt. Every reasonable effort should be made to locate missing debtors sufficiently in advance of the bar of the applicable statute of limitations, such as 28 U.S.C. 2415, to permit the timely filing of suit if such action is warranted. If the missing debtor has signed a confess-judgment note and is in default, referral of the note for the entry of judgment should not be delayed because of the debtor's missing status.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Financial condition of debtor.</E> Collection action may also be suspended temporarily on a claim when the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty or personal property and is unable to make payments on the Government's claim or effect a compromise at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review and action, and:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started running anew; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Future collection can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the statute of limitations, with due regard to the 10-year limitation prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(1); or</P>
            <P>(iii) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection action will be temporarily suspended, and such temporary suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principle amount of the debt with interest at a later date.</P>

            <P>(3) Request for waiver or administrative review. If the statute under which waiver or administrative review is sought is “mandatory,” that is, if it prohibits the agency from collecting the debt prior to the agency's consideration of the request for waiver or review (see <E T="03">Califano</E> v. <E T="03">Yamasaki,</E> 422 U.S. 682 (1979)), then collection action must be suspended until either: The agency has considered the request for waiver/review; or the applicable time limit for making the waiver/review request, as prescribed in a written notice, has expired and the debtor, upon notice, has not made such a request. If the applicable waiver/review statute is “permissive,” that is, if it does not require all <PRTPAGE P="241"/>requests for waiver/review to be considered, and if it does not prohibit collection action pending consideration of a waiver/request (for example, 5 U.S.C. 5584), collection action may be suspended pending agency action on a waiver/review request based upon appropriate consideration, on a case-by-case basis, as to whether:</P>
            <P>(i) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted or that the debt (in whole or in part) will be found not owing from the debtor;</P>
            <P>(ii) The Government's interests would be protected, if suspension were granted, by reasonable assurance that the debt could be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship on the debtor.</P>
            <P>(4) If the applicable statutes and regulations would not authorize refund by the agency to the debtor of amounts collected prior to agency consideration of the debtor's waiver/review request (in the event the agency acts favorably on it), collection action should ordinarily be suspended, without regard to the factors specified for permissive waivers, unless it appears clear, based on the request and the surrounding circumstances, that the request is frivolous and was made primarily to delay collection. See 4 CFR 104.2.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of collection activity.</E> Collection activity may be terminated and NASA may close its file on the claim based on the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Inability to collect any substantial amount. Collection action may be terminated on a claim when it becomes clear that the Government cannot collect or enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor, having due regard for the judicial remedies available to the Government, the debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law. In determining the debtor's inability to pay, the following factors, among others, may be considered: Age and health of the debtor; present and potential income; inheritance prospects; the possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; the availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Inability to locate debtor.</E> Collection action may be terminated on a claim when the debtor cannot be located, and either:</P>
            <P>(i) There is no security remaining to be liquidated; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The applicable statute of limitations has run and the prospects of collecting by offset, notwithstanding the bar of the statute of limitations, are too remote to justify retention of the claim.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost will exceed recovery.</E> Collection action may be terminated on a claim when it is likely that the cost of further collection action will exceed the amount recoverable thereby.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Claim legally without merit.</E> Collection action should be terminated immediately on a claim whenever it is determined that the claim is legally without merit.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Claim cannot be substantiated by evidence.</E> Collection action should be terminated when it is determined that the evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and efforts to reduce voluntary payment are unavailing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Transfer of claim.</E> When NASA has doubt as to whether collection action should be suspended or terminated on a claim, it may refer the claim to the Government Accountability Office for advice. When a significant enforcement policy is involved in reducing a statutory penalty or forfeiture to judgment, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, such as the suspension or revocation of a license or the privilege of participating in a Government-sponsored program, NASA may refer such a claim for litigation even though termination of collection activity might otherwise be given consideration under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Claims on which NASA holds a judgment by assignment or otherwise will be referred to the Department of Justice for further action if renewal of the judgment lien or enforced collection proceedings are justified under the criteria discussed in this section.</P>

            <P>(2) Claims for which the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. Referrals should be made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection action and the observance of the regulations contained in this subpart, and in any event, well within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor. Ordinarily, referrals should be made within l year of the agency's final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Minimum amount.</E> NASA is not to refer claims of less than $600, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, for litigation unless:</P>
            <P>(i) Referral is important to a significant enforcement policy; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The debtor not only has the clear ability to pay the claim but the Government can effectively enforce payment, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.</P>
            <P>(b) Claims arising from audit exceptions taken by the GAO to payments made by agencies must be referred to the GAO for review and approval prior to referral to the Department of Justice for litigation, unless NASA has been granted an exception by the GAO. Referrals shall comply with instructions, including monetary limitations, contained in the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance to Federal Agencies and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) When the merits of the claim, the amount owed on the claim, or the propriety of acceptance of a proposed compromise, suspension, or termination are in doubt, the designated official should refer the matter to the Government Accountability Office for resolution and instructions prior to proceeding with collection action and/or referral to the Department of Justice for litigation.</P>
            <P>(d) Once a claim has been referred to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice pursuant to this section, NASA shall refrain from having any contact with the debtor about the pending claim and shall direct the debtor to the Government Accountability Office or to the Department of Justice, as appropriate, when questions concerning the claim are raised by the debtor. The Government Accountability Office or the Department of Justice, as appropriate, shall be immediately notified by NASA of any payments which are received from the debtor subsequent to referral of a claim under this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR).</E> Unless an exception has been granted by the Department of Justice in consultation with the General Accounting Office, the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), which was officially implemented by NASA, effective March 1, 1983, shall be used with all referrals of administratively uncollectible claims. As required by the CCLR, the following information must be included:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Report of prior collection actions.</E> A checklist or brief summary of the actions previously taken to collect or compromise the claim. If any of the administrative collection actions have been omitted, the reason for their omission must be provided. GAO, the United States Attorney, or the Civil Division of the Department of Justice may return claims at their option when there is insufficient justification for the omission of one or more of the administrative collection actions enumerated in this subpart (see 4 CFR part 102).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Current address of debtor.</E> The current address of the debtor, or the name <PRTPAGE P="243"/>and address of the agent for a corporation upon whom service may be made. Reasonable and appropriate steps will be taken to locate missing parties in all cases. Referrals to the Department of Justice for the commencement of foreclosure of other proceedings, in which the current address of any party is unknown, will be accompanied by a listing of the prior known addresses of such party and a statement of the steps taken to locate that party.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit data.</E> Reasonably current credit data which indicates that there is a reasonable prospect of effecting enforced collection from the debtor, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government. Such credit data may take the form of:</P>
            <P>(i) A commercial credit report;</P>
            <P>(ii) An agency investigative report showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses;</P>
            <P>(iii) The individual debtor's own financial statement executed under penalty of perjury reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses; or</P>
            <P>(iv) An audited balance sheet of a corporate debtor.</P>
            <P>(4) Reasons for credit data omissions. The credit data may be omitted if:</P>
            <P>(i) A surety bond is available in an amount sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;</P>
            <P>(ii) The forced sale value of the security available for application to the Government's claim is sufficient to satisfy the claim in full;</P>
            <P>(iii) NASA wishes to liquidate loan collateral through judicial foreclosure but does not desire a deficiency judgment;</P>
            <P>(iv) The debtor is in bankruptcy or receivership;</P>
            <P>(v) The debtor's liability to the Government is fully covered by insurance, in which case NASA will furnish such information as it can develop concerning the identity and address of the insurer and the type and amount of insurance coverage; or</P>
            <P>(vi) The status of the debtor is such that credit data is not normally available or cannot reasonably be obtained, for example, a unit of State or local government.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Preservation of evidence.</E> Care will be taken to preserve all files, records, and exhibits on claims referred or to be referred to the Department of Justice for litigation.

            <SUBJECT>Scope of subpart.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart applies to collection of claims by administrative offset under section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3716), other statutory authority, or the common law; it does not include “Salary Offset,” which is governed by subpart 1261.6, infra.</P>
            <P>(b) NASA shall refer past due, legally enforceable nontax debts which are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary of the Treasury for collection by centralized administrative offset. For purposes of debts governed by this provision, NASA adopts and will follow the procedures established by the Department of the Treasury in 31 CFR 901.3.</P>

            <P>(c) For claims not subject to mandatory transfer to the Department of the Treasury pursuant to paragraph (b), NASA may consider <E T="03">ad hoc</E> non-centralized administrative offset of claims at its sole discretion. Any <E T="03">ad hoc</E> non-<PRTPAGE P="244"/>centralized administrative offset of claims will be conducted consistent with the requirements of 31 CFR 901.3(c).</P>
            <P>(1) Debts owed by any State or local Government;</P>
            <P>(2) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. However, unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definition.</SUBJECT>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Administrative offset</E>—the term, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means “withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government.”</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1261.502</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Notification procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before collecting any claims through administrative offset, a 30-day written notice must be sent to the debtor by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice must include:</P>
            <P>(1) The nature and amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) NASA's intention to collect by administrative offset; and</P>
            <P>(3) An explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), or other relied upon statutory authority, which must include a statement that the debtor has the opportunity, within the 30-day notice period, to:</P>
            <P>(i) Inspect and copy records of NASA with respect to the debt;</P>
            <P>(ii) Request a review by NASA of its decision related to the claim; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Enter into a written agreement with the designated official (see § 1261.402) to repay the amount of the claim. However, sound judgment should be exercised in determining whether to accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. The determination should balance the Government's interest in collecting the debt against fairness to the debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, NASA should accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</P>
            <P>(b) NASA may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by paragraph (a) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and</P>
            <P>(2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset must be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly refunded.</P>
            <P>(3) In cases where the procedural requirements of paragraph (a) of this section had previously been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt under some other statutory or regulatory authority, such as pursuant to a notice of audit disallowance or salary offset under § 1261.603, the agency is not required to duplicate those requirements before taking administrative offset.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1261.503</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Agency records inspection; hearing or review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NASA shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for a live, telephonic, or video-teleconference hearing when:</P>
            <P>(1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the agency to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; or</P>

            <P>(2) Unless otherwise required by law, a hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, although significant matters <PRTPAGE P="245"/>discussed at the hearing should be documented. See 31 CFR 901.3(e)(1). Such hearing may be an informal discussion/interview with the debtor, face-to-face meeting between debtor and cognizant NASA personnel, or written formal submission by the debtor and response by the NASA cognizant personnel with an opportunity for oral presentation. The hearing will be conducted before or in the presence of an official as designated by the NASA General Counsel on a case-by-case basis. The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. However, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, the hearing may be analogous to a fact-finding proceeding with oral presentations; or an informal meeting with or interview of the employee; or formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation, and decision based on the available written record. Ordinarily, hearings may consist of informal conferences before the hearing official in which the employee and Agency officials will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument. The employee may represent himself or herself or be represented by an individual of his or her choice at no cost to the United States. The hearing official must maintain or provide for a summary record of the hearing provided under this subpart. The decision of the reviewing/hearing official should be communicated in writing (no particular form is required) to the affected parties and will constitute the final administrative decision of the Agency.</P>
            <P>(b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not require a hearing with respect to debt collection systems, as determinations of indebtedness or waiver from these rarely involve issues of credibility or veracity since NASA has determined that review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes. See 31 CFR 901.3(e)(3).</P>
            <P>(c) In those cases where a live, telephonic, or video-teleconference hearing is not required or granted, NASA will nevertheless accord the debtor an opportunity to submit any position regarding the matter by documentation and/or written presentation—that is, the Agency will make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the available written record. See 31 CFR 901.3(e)(4). In such case, the responsible official or designee shall refer the request to the appropriate NASA Office of General Counsel or Chief Counsel for review and recommendation.</P>
            <P>(d) A request to inspect and/or copy the debtor's own debt records or related files, and/or for a hearing or review accompanied by a statement of the basis or grounds for such hearing or review, must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice under § 1261.502(a). A reasonable time to inspect and copy records will be provided during official working hours, but not to exceed 5 business days, unless a verified statement showing good cause requires a longer period. Any suspension of collection or other charges during the period of the inspection, or hearing or review, shall comply with §§ 1261.412 and 1261.416. Requests for or consideration of compromising the debt must comply with § 1261.414.</P>

            <P>(c) Requests to and from NASA should be processed within 30 calendar days of receipt. If such processing is impractical or not feasible, notice to extend the time period for another 30 calendar days should be forwarded 10 calendar days prior to the expiration of the first 30-day period.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>

            <SUBJECT>Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, NASA may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debts owed to the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in accordance with the OPM regulations (see 5 CFR 831.1801, <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
            <P>(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, NASA shall include a written certification that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) NASA has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and</P>
            <P>(3) NASA has complied with the requirements of this subpart 1261.5 which implements 4 CFR 102.3, including any required hearing or review.</P>
            <P>(c) Once NASA has decided to request administrative offset under this section, the request should be made as soon as practical after completion of the applicable procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify and “flag” the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the debtor should be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would render the offset unjust.</P>
            <P>(d) If NASA collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the designated official should act promptly to modify or terminate the agency's request to OPM for offset.</P>
            <P>(e) OPM is not required or authorized by 4 CFR 102.4 to review the merits of NASA's determination with respect to:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount and validity of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) Waiver under an applicable statute; or</P>
            <P>(3) Provide or not provide a live, telephonic, or video-teleconference hearing.</P>

            <P>This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5514 in accordance with the OPM regulation and establishes the procedural requirements for recovering pre-judgment debts from the current pay account of an employee through what is commonly called salary offset, including a situation where NASA (the current paying agency) is not the employee's creditor agency. Salary offset to satisfy a judgment or a court determined debt is governed by section 124 of Pub. L. 97-276 (October 2, 1982), 5 U.S.C. 5514 <E T="03">note.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Scope of subpart.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Coverage.</E> This subpart applies to agencies and employees as defined in § 1261.602.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This subpart and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in recovering certain prejudgment debts by administrative offset except where the employee consents to the recovery, from the current pay account of an employee. Because it is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart should be consistent with subpart 1261.5.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Excluded debts or claims.</E> The procedures contained in this subpart do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705, employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108, and debts determined by a court as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514 <E T="03">note</E>).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiver requests and claims to the Government Accountability Office.</E> This subpart does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of a salary overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the Government Accountability Office in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Government Accountability Office. Similarly, in the case of other types of debts, it does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver, if waiver is available under any statutory provision pertaining to the particular debt being collected.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>If NASA determines that a Federal employee is indebted to the United States or is notified of such by the head of another agency (or delegee), the amount of indebtedness may be collected in monthly installments, or regularly established pay intervals, by deduction from the affected employee's pay account. The deductions may be made from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, from other authorized pay. The requirements in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section must be met before a deduction is made from the current pay account of an employee.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Written notice.</E> The employee must be sent a minimum of 30 days written notice prior to further offset action, which specifies:</P>
            <P>(1) The origin, nature and amount of the indebtedness, and the official to contact within the agency (ordinarily, the designated financial management official for the particular installation);</P>
            <P>(2) The intention of the agency to initiate collection of the debt through salary offset by deductions from the employee's current disposable pay, stating the amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of intended deductions (the amount to be deducted for any period, without the consent of the employee, may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay);</P>
            <P>(3) An explanation of any interest, penalties, or administrative costs included in the amount, and that such assessment must be made unless excused in accordance with 14 CFR 1261.412;</P>
            <P>(4) The right for an opportunity (which does not toll the running of the 30-day period) to inspect and copy NASA records relating to the debt or to request and receive (if reasonable) a copy of such records, provided that such opportunity must be exercised on or before the 15th day following receipt of the notice and can be conducted only during official working hours for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 5 working days;</P>
            <P>(5) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to NASA) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the authorized agency official (see 14 CFR 1261.402) and documented in NASA's files (see 14 CFR 1261.407(d));</P>
            <P>(6) An opportunity for a hearing, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, on the agency's determination concerning the existence and amount of the debt, and the terms of the repayment schedule (in the case of an employee whose repayment schedule is established other than by written agreement);</P>
            <P>(7) The hearing request should be addressed to the Office of the NASA General Counsel or to the Office of Chief Counsel of the NASA installation involved, as appropriate; counsel's name and address will be as stated in the notice.</P>
            <P>(8) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and</P>

            <P>(9) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later <PRTPAGE P="249"/>waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception to entitlement to written notice.</E> NASA is not required to comply with paragraph (a) of this section for any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Petition filing; hearing; decision and review.</E> The notice described in paragraph (a) of this section should include the following provisions, which may be copied and attached to the notice.</P>
            <P>(1) The employee may petition for a hearing, but such petition must be in writing and received by NASA on or before the 15th day following receipt of the notice, and include a statement of the reasons for such hearing. No particular form is required, and a timely, legible letter request (with the stated reasons) will suffice; however, the employee must sign the petition and include with it, with reasonable specificity, all the supporting facts and evidence, including a list of the witnesses, if any.</P>
            <P>(2) The petition should be addressed to the Agency counsel designated in the notice, but the hearing will be conducted by an official not under the supervision or control of the NASA Administrator. The Agency Chief Financial Officer is authorized to appoint an administrative law judge or other Federal executive branch employee or official on a reimbursable or other basis. Notice of the name and address of the hearing official will be sent to the employee within 10 days of receipt of petition.</P>
            <P>(3) The timely filing of the petition will stay the commencement of collection; and the final decision on the hearing will be issued at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings.</P>
            <P>(4) Any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:</P>
            <P>(i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under Chapter 75 of Title 5, United States Code, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729 through 3731 of Title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of Title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority.</P>
            <P>(5) As for the conduct of any live, telephonic, or video teleconference hearing, for additional guidance see 14 CFR 1261.503.</P>
            <P>(d) Petition after time expiration. No petition for a hearing is to be granted if made after the 15-day period prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the employee can show to the satisfaction of the agency official indicated on the notice that the delay was caused by circumstances beyond his or her control (for example, proven incapacity, illness, or hospitalization), or that the agency did not give notice of the time limit and the employee was otherwise unaware of such limit.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Limitation on amount and duration of deductions.</E> Ordinarily, debts are to be collected in one lump-sum payment. However, if the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection must be made in installments. The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay (see 14 CFR 1261.411), but the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made (unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount). Deduction must commence with the next full pay interval (ordinarily, the next biweekly pay period). Such installment deductions must be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of active duty or employment, as the case may be, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Determining ability to pay.</E> An offset may produce an extreme financial <PRTPAGE P="250"/>hardship for an employee if it prevents the employee from meeting costs necessarily incurred for essential subsistence expenses for food, reasonable housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care. In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting the essential subsistence expenses, the employee may be required to show income from all sources (including spouse and dependents, if applicable), list all known assets, explain exceptional expenses, and produce any other relevant factors.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Liquidation from final check; other recovery.</E> If the employee retires or resigns from Federal service, or if his or her employment or period of active duty ends before collection of the debt is completed, the balance may be deducted from the final salary payment and any remaining balance from the lump-sum leave, if applicable. If the debt is not fully paid by offset from any final payment due the former employee as of the date of separation, offset may be made from later payments of any kind due the former employee from the United States (as provided in 14 CFR part 1261 subpart 1261.5, including offset from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund under 14 CFR 1261.507).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</E> Assessment of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, on debts being collected under this subpart, shall be in accordance with 14 CFR 1261.412 which implements 4 CFR 102.13.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Salary offset request by a creditor agency other than NASA (the current paying agency).</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Format of the request.</E> Upon completion of the procedures established by the creditor agency under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the creditor agency must:</P>
            <P>(1) Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is/are due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the creditor agency's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by OPM;</P>
            <P>(2) If the collection must be made in installments, the creditor agency must also advise NASA of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the commencing date of the first installment, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required; and</P>
            <P>(3) Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the writing or statement is attached to the debt claim request, the creditor agency must also indicate the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2) and give the date(s) the action(s) was/were taken.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitation period.</E> The creditor agency may not initiate offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, except as provided in 14 CFR 1261.506, which implements 4 CFR 102.3(b)(3).<PRTPAGE P="251"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employees who are separating or have separated</E>—(1) <E T="03">Employees who are in the process of separating.</E> If the employee is in the process of separating, the creditor agency must submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in 5 CFR 550.1104(1) of the OPM regulations (14 CFR 1261.603(f)) for “liquidation from final check.” NASA must then certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and the employee as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If NASA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it should notify the creditor agency and forward the copy of the debt claim and certification to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding. However, the creditor agency, not NASA, must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection can be made.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Employees who have already separated.</E> If the employee is already separated and all payments due from NASA have been paid, NASA must return the claim to the creditor agency for any further collection, indicating the employee's date of separation and the current employment and mailing address(es), if known.</P>
            <P>(3) Employee who transfers from NASA to another Federal agency.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Certification of amount collected.</E> If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to NASA, the employee transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is collected in full, NASA must then certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. A copy of the certification should be furnished the employee, and another copy furnished to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Official personnel folder insertion; new paying agency.</E> Information on the debt claim must be inserted in the employee's official personnel folder along with a copy of the certification of the amount which has been collected. Upon receiving the official personnel folder, the new paying agency must resume the collection from the employee's current pay account and notify the employee and the creditor agency of the resumption. It will not be necessary for the creditor agency to repeat the due process procedures described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 of this subpart in order to resume the collection. However, it will be the responsibility of the creditor agency to review the debt upon receiving NASA's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Processing the debt claim upon receipt</E>—(1) <E T="03">Incomplete claim.</E> If NASA receives incomplete debt claim information, it must return the request with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart must be provided and complete debt claim information received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Complete claim.</E> If NASA receives a properly documented debt claim, deductions should be scheduled to begin prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. A copy of the debt claim request must be given to the debtor, along with notice of the date deductions will commence if different from that stated on the debt claim request.</P>
            <P>(3) NASA is not required or authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim request.</P>

            <P>(b) When the debtor works for the creditor agency, the creditor agency may contact any agent (of another agency) designated in appendix A of 5 <PRTPAGE P="252"/>CFR part 581 to arrange for a hearing official. Agencies must then cooperate as required by 4 CFR 102.1 and provide a hearing official.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose of these rules.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The pertinent provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act at 5 U.S.C. 504 (hereinafter “the Act”) provide for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”). An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails, unless it has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, or the Agency's position in the proceeding was substantially justified, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use in determining awards.</P>
            <P>(b) As used in this part:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Adversary adjudication</E> means:</P>
            <P>(i) An adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the United States is represented by counsel or otherwise, but excludes an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate or for the purpose of granting or renewing a license;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any appeal of a decision made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 605) before an agency board of contract appeals as provided in section 8 of the CDA (41 U.S.C. 607);</P>

            <P>(iii) Any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of Title 31 (added by section 6104 of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1948, Oct. 21, 1986), 31 U.S.C. 3801, <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended); and</P>
            <P>(iv) The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993 (added by section 4(b), of RFRA (Pub. L. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1489, Nov. 16, 1993), 42 U.S.C. 2000bb).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjudicative officer</E> means the deciding official, without regard to whether the official is designated an administrative law judge, a hearing officer or examiner, or otherwise, who presided at the adversary adjudication;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Position of the agency</E> means, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary adjudication is based;</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Party,</E> as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3), includes a person or agency named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party, in an agency proceeding, and a person or agency admitted by an agency as a party for limited purposes, and who meets the eligibility requirements of § 1262.104; and<PRTPAGE P="253"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Agency</E> with a capital A denotes the NASA.</P>
            <P>(c) Determination of <E T="03">Substantially justified.</E> Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.</P>

            <P>The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced before NASA on or after August 5, 1985. It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application for fees and expenses, as described in subpart 1262.2, had been filed with the Agency within 30 days after August 5, 1985, and to any adversary adjudication pending on or commenced on or after October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</P>

            <P>(a) The Act applies to the following adversary adjudications conducted by the Agency:</P>
            <P>(1) Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of NASA or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceedings;</P>
            <P>(2) Appeals of decisions made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before the Board of Contract Appeals (BCA) as provided in Section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607);</P>

            <P>(3) Any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of Title 31 (31 U.S.C. 3801, <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended); and</P>
            <P>(4) Adjudications under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb).</P>
            <P>(b) The Act does not apply to:</P>
            <P>(1) Any proceeding in which this Agency may prescribe a lawful present or future rate;</P>
            <P>(2) Proceedings to grant or renew licenses (note, however, that proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise adversary adjudications); and</P>
            <P>(3) Proceedings which are covered by a compromise or settlement agreement, unless specifically consented to in such agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) NASA may also designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Agency's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filling of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.</P>
            <P>(d) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses, the applicant must be a “party” to the adversary adjudication for which an award is sought. The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart 1262.2.</P>
            <P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
            <P>(2) Any owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and</P>

            <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.</P>
            <P>(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than as a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather then to business interests.</P>

            <P>(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award subject to paragraph (b) of this section, for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. No presumption arises that the agency's position was not substantially justified simply because the agency did not prevail. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency.</P>
            <P>(b) An award, for any portion of the adversary adjudication, will be denied if the applicant has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, or denied or reduced if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>

            <P>(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which this Agency pays expert witnesses, which is $20 an hour (5 hours maximum) or maximum daily rate of $100 (3 days maximum). However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:</P>
            <P>(1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar service, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>

This Agency will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553).</P>
            <P>(b) Any person may file with the Agency a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should be addressed to the General Counsel, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546; should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Agency should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used; and should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted.

            <P>(a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 1262.104(f) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>
            <P>(b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public records of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The materials in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Agency's regulations under the Freedom of Information Act, at 14 CFR part 1206.</P>

The court's determination of any appeal heard under this [authority] shall be based solely on the factual record made before the agency.

          <P>(e) If, before such an initial decision becomes final, the defendant files a motion with the presiding officer seeking to reopen on the grounds that extraordinary circumstances prevented the defendant from filing an answer, the initial decision shall be stayed pending the presiding officer's decision on the motion.</P>
          <P>(f) If, on such motion, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing the failure to file a timely answer, the presiding officer shall withdraw the initial decision under paragraph (c) of this section, if such a decision has been issued, and shall grant the defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.</P>

          <P>(k) If the authority head decides that extraordinary circumstances excused the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority head shall remand the case to the presiding officer with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity to answer.</P>
          <P>(l) If the authority head decides that the defendant's failure to file a timely answer is not excused, the authority head shall reinstate the initial decision of the presiding officer, which shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the authority head issues such decision.</P>

          <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the presiding officer, and the authority head upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>

          <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>

          <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
          <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
          <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
          <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>

          <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
          <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
          <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and</P>

          <P>(b) The time for appeal to the authority head is as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) A notice of appeal may be filed at any time within 30 days after the presiding officer issues an initial decision. However, if any other party files a motion for a reconsideration under § 1264.137, consideration of the appeal shall be stayed automatically pending resolution of the motion for reconsideration.</P>
          <P>(2) If a motion for reconsideration is timely filed, a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after the presiding officer denies the motion or issues a revised initial decision, whichever applies.</P>

          <P>(4) The authority head may extend the initial 30-day period for an additional 30 days if the defendant files with the authority head a request for an extension within the initial 30-day period and shows good cause.</P>
          <P>(c) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the authority head and the time for filing motions for reconsideration under § 1264.137 has expired, the presiding officer shall forward the record of the proceeding to the authority head.</P>

          <P>(d) A notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a written brief specifying exceptions to the initial decision and reasons supporting the exceptions.<PRTPAGE P="277"/>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of this Part is to ensure that consistent cross-waivers of liability are included in NASA agreements for activities related to the ISS and for NASA's science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS that involve a launch.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1266.101</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The provisions at § 1266.102 are intended to implement the cross-waiver requirement in Article 16 of the intergovernmental agreement entitled, “Agreement Among the Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of the European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian Federation, and the Government of the United States of America concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station (IGA).” Article 16 establishes a cross-waiver of liability for use by the Partner States and their related entities and requires that this reciprocal waiver of claims be extended to contractually or otherwise-related entities of NASA by requiring those entities to make similar waivers of liability. Thus, NASA is required to include IGA-based cross-waivers in agreements for ISS activities that fall within the scope of “Protected Space Operations,” as defined in § 1266.102. The provisions of § 1266.102 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA agreements for activities that implement the IGA and the memoranda of understanding between the United States and its respective international partners. The provisions of § 1266.104 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA launch agreements for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1266.102</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Cross-waiver of liability for agreements for activities related to the International Space Station.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The objective of this section is to implement NASA's responsibility to flow down the cross-waiver of liability in Article 16 of the IGA to its related entities in the interest of encouraging participation in the exploration, exploitation, and use of outer space through the International Space Station (ISS). The IGA declares the Partner States' intention that the cross-waiver of liability be broadly construed to achieve this objective.</P>
          <P>(b) For the purposes of this section:</P>
          <P>(1) The term “Party” means a party to a NASA agreement involving activities in connection with the ISS.</P>
          <P>(2)(i) The term “related entity” means:</P>
          <P>(A) A contractor or subcontractor of a Party or a Partner State at any tier;</P>
          <P>(B) A user or customer of a Party or a Partner State at any tier; or</P>
          <P>(C) A contractor or subcontractor of a user or customer of a Party or a Partner State at any tier.</P>
          <P>(ii) The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor” include suppliers of any kind.</P>
          <P>(iii) The term “related entity” may also apply to a State, or an agency or institution of a State, having the same relationship to a Partner State as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section or otherwise engaged in the implementation of Protected Space Operations as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The term “damage” means:</P>
          <P>(i) Bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, any person;</P>
          <P>(ii) Damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property;</P>
          <P>(iii) Loss of revenue or profits; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Other direct, indirect, or consequential damage.</P>
          <P>(4) The term “launch vehicle” means an object, or any part thereof, intended for launch, launched from Earth, or returning to Earth which carries payloads or persons, or both.</P>
          <P>(5) The term “payload” means all property to be flown or used on or in a launch vehicle or the ISS.</P>
          <P>(6) The term “Protected Space Operations” means all launch or transfer vehicle activities, ISS activities, and payload activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and outer space in implementation of the IGA, MOUs concluded pursuant to the IGA, and implementing arrangements. It includes, but is not limited to:</P>

          <P>(i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, integration, operation, or use of launch or <PRTPAGE P="280"/>transfer vehicles, the ISS, payloads, or instruments, as well as related support equipment and facilities and services; and</P>
          <P>(ii) All activities related to ground support, test, training, simulation, or guidance and control equipment and related facilities or services. “Protected Space Operations” also includes all activities related to evolution of the ISS, as provided for in Article 14 of the IGA. “Protected Space Operations” excludes activities on Earth which are conducted on return from the ISS to develop further a payload's product or process for use other than for ISS-related activities in implementation of the IGA.</P>
          <P>(7) The term “transfer vehicle” means any vehicle that operates in space and transfers payloads or persons or both between two different space objects, between two different locations on the same space object, or between a space object and the surface of a celestial body. A transfer vehicle also includes a vehicle that departs from and returns to the same location on a space object.</P>
          <P>(8) The term “Partner State” includes each Contracting Party for which the IGA has entered into force, pursuant to Article 25 of the IGA or pursuant to any successor agreement. A Partner State includes its Cooperating Agency. It also includes any entity specified in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NASA and the Government of Japan to assist the Government of Japan's Cooperating Agency in the implementation of that MOU.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) Cross-waiver of liability: Each Party agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which each Party waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims, against:</P>
          <P>(i) Another Party;</P>
          <P>(ii) A Partner State other than the United States of America;</P>
          <P>(iii) A related entity of any entity identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(iv) The employees of any of the entities identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) In addition, each Party shall, by contract or otherwise, extend the cross-waiver of liability, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, to its related entities by requiring them, by contract or otherwise, to:</P>
          <P>(i) Waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Require that their related entities waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver of liability includes a cross-waiver of claims arising from the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, which entered into force on September 1, 1972, where the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations.</P>
          <P>(4) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, this cross-waiver of liability shall not be applicable to:</P>
          <P>(i) Claims between a Party and its own related entity or between its own related entities;</P>
          <P>(ii) Claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors or subrogees (except when a subrogee is a Party to the agreement or is otherwise bound by the terms of this cross-waiver) for bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, such person;</P>
          <P>(iii) Claims for damage caused by willful misconduct;</P>
          <P>(iv) Intellectual property claims;</P>

          <P>(v) Claims for damage resulting from a failure of a Party to extend the cross-<PRTPAGE P="281"/>waiver of liability to its related entities, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or</P>

          <SUBJECT>Cross-waiver of liability for launch agreements for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The purpose of this section is to implement a cross-waiver of liability between the parties to agreements for NASA's science or space exploration activities that are not related to the International Space Station (ISS) but involve a launch. It is intended that the cross-waiver of liability be broadly construed to achieve this objective.</P>
          <P>(b) For purposes of this section:</P>
          <P>(1) The term “Party” means a party to a NASA agreement for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS that involve a launch.</P>
          <P>(2) (i) The term “related entity” means:</P>
          <P>(A) A contractor or subcontractor of a Party at any tier;</P>
          <P>(B) A user or customer of a Party at any tier; or</P>
          <P>(C) A contractor or subcontractor of a user or customer of a Party at any tier.</P>
          <P>(ii) The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor” include suppliers of any kind.</P>
          <P>(iii) The term “related entity” may also apply to a State or an agency or institution of a State, having the same relationship to a Party as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, or otherwise engaged in the implementation of Protected Space Operations as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The term “damage” means:</P>
          <P>(i) Bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, any person;</P>
          <P>(ii) Damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property;</P>
          <P>(iii) Loss of revenue or profits; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Other direct, indirect, or consequential damage.</P>
          <P>(4) The term “launch vehicle” means an object, or any part thereof, intended for launch, launched from Earth, or returning to Earth which carries payloads or persons, or both.</P>
          <P>(5) The term “payload” means all property to be flown or used on or in a launch vehicle.</P>
          <P>(6) The term “Protected Space Operations” means all launch or transfer vehicle activities and payload activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and outer space in implementation of an agreement for launch services. Protected Space Operations begins at the signature of the agreement and ends when all activities done in implementation of the agreement are completed. It includes, but is not limited to:</P>
          <P>(i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, integration, operation, or use of launch or transfer vehicles, payloads, or instruments, as well as related support equipment and facilities and services; and</P>
          <P>(ii) All activities related to ground support, test, training, simulation, or guidance and control equipment and related facilities or services. The term “Protected Space Operations” excludes activities on Earth that are conducted on return from space to develop further a payload's product or process for use other than for the activities within the scope of an agreement for launch services.</P>
          <P>(7) The term “transfer vehicle” means any vehicle that operates in space and transfers payloads or persons or both between two different space objects, between two different locations on the same space object, or between a space object and the surface of a celestial body. A transfer vehicle also includes a vehicle that departs from and returns to the same location on a space object.</P>

          <P>(c)(1) Cross-waiver of liability: Each Party agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which each Party <PRTPAGE P="282"/>waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims, against:</P>
          <P>(i) Another Party;</P>
          <P>(ii) A party to another NASA agreement that includes flight on the same launch vehicle;</P>
          <P>(iii) A related entity of any entity identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(iv) The employees of any of the entities identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) In addition, each Party shall extend the cross-waiver of liability, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, to its own related entities by requiring them, by contract or otherwise, to:</P>
          <P>(i) Waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Require that their related entities waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver of liability includes a cross-waiver of claims arising from the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, which entered into force on September 1, 1972, where the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations.</P>
          <P>(4) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, this cross-waiver of liability shall not be applicable to:</P>
          <P>(i) Claims between a Party and its own related entity or between its own related entities;</P>
          <P>(ii) Claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors, or subrogees (except when a subrogee is a Party to the agreement or is otherwise bound by the terms of this cross-waiver) for bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, such person;</P>
          <P>(iii) Claims for damage caused by willful misconduct;</P>
          <P>(iv) Intellectual property claims;</P>
          <P>(v) Claims for damages resulting from a failure of a Party to extend the cross-waiver of liability to its related entities, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Claims by a Party arising out of or relating to another Party's failure to perform its obligations under the agreement.</P>
          <P>(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to create the basis for a claim or suit where none would otherwise exist.</P>
          <P>(6) This cross-waiver shall not be applicable when 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IX, Chapter 701 is applicable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1271.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence <PRTPAGE P="287"/>made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 1271.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $20,134, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $20,134 and $201,340, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1274.101</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following policy guidelines establish uniform requirements for NASA cooperative agreements awarded to commercial firms.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1274.102</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The business relationship between NASA and the recipient of a cooperative agreement differs from the relationship that exists between NASA and the recipient of a grant. Under the auspices of a grant, there is very little involvement and interaction between NASA and the grantee (other than a few administrative, funding, and reporting requirements, or in some cases matching of funds). Under a cooperative agreement, because of its substantial involvement, NASA assumes a higher degree of responsibility for the technical performance outcomes and associated financial costs of research activities. In some cooperative agreement projects, NASA may be required to indemnify the recipient (to the extent authorized by Congress). While the principal purpose of NASA's involvement and commitment of resources is to stimulate or support research activity, a major incentive for involvement by commercial firms (particularly where costs are shared) is the profit potential from marketable products expected to result from the cooperative agreement project.</P>
            <P>(b) Cooperative agreements (in areas or research relevant to NASA's mission) are ordinarily entered into with commercial firms to—</P>
            <P>(1) Support research and development;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide technology transfer from the Government to the recipient; or</P>
            <P>(3) Develop a capability among U.S. firms to potentially enhance U.S. competitiveness.</P>
            <P>(c) Projects that normally result in a cooperative agreement award to a commercial entity are projects that:</P>
            <P>(1) Are not intended for the direct benefit of NASA;</P>
            <P>(2) Are expected to benefit the general public;</P>
            <P>(3) Require substantial cost sharing; and</P>
            <P>(4) Have commercial applications and profit generating potential.</P>
            <P>(d) The principal purpose of cooperative agreements is to stimulate research to benefit the general public through the criteria stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. Since all research activities must be within NASA's authorized expenditure of appropriations, there may be instances where NASA can derive incidental use or benefits while preserving the principal purpose of the cooperative agreement. However, a careful balance must be established and maintained in the cooperative agreement's technical and business objectives, so that the principal purpose of the project serves to benefit the general public (i.e., technology will transfer from the Government to the public and the commercial partner expects a marketable product to result). If a cooperative agreement is awarded when the proper award instrument should have been a contract (because the primary purpose of the award is for the direct benefit of NASA), the cooperative agreement award can be protested. Thus, before pursuing any incidental benefits that materialize under a cooperative agreement, NASA Centers should ensure that the advice of legal counsel is obtained.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Administrator.</E> The Administrator or Deputy Administrator of NASA.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Agreement officer.</E> A Government employee (usually a Contracting Officer or Grant Officer) who has been delegated the authority to negotiate, award, or administer the cooperative agreement. Most often Contracting Officers are delegated this authority for the more complex cooperative agreement projects.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Assistant Administrator for Procurement.</E> The head of the Office of Procurement, NASA Headquarters (Code H).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Cash contributions.</E> The cash invested in a given program or project by the Federal Government and/or recipient. The recipient's cash contributions may include money contributed by third parties.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Closeout.</E> The process by which NASA determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the award have been completed by the recipient and NASA.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Commercial item.</E> The definition in FAR 2.101 is applicable.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Consortium.</E> A consortium is a group of organizations that enter into an agreement to collaborate for the purposes of the cooperative agreement with NASA. The agreement to collaborate can take the form of a legal entity such as a partnership or joint venture but it is not necessary that such an entity be created. A consortium may be made up of firms that normally compete for commercial or Government business or may be made up of firms that perform complementary functions in a given industry.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Cooperative agreement.</E> As defined by 31 U.S.C. 6305, cooperative agreements are financial assistance instruments used to stimulate or support activities for authorized purposes and in which the Government participates substantially in the performance of the effort. This Part 1274 covers only cooperative agreements with commercial firms where resource sharing is involved. Cooperative agreements with other types of organizations are covered by 14 CFR Part 1260.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Cooperative agreement notice (CAN).</E> Publication on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) or NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) websites advertising the solicitation of competitive proposals for the award of a cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Cost sharing.</E> Arrangement whereby the Government and the recipient share the funding requirements of a program or project at an agreed upon ratio or percentage (normally 50/50). Normally, the Government's payment of its share of the costs is contingent upon the accomplishment of tangible milestones (preferred method). Any payment arrangement that is based on a method other than the accomplishment of tangible milestones (e.g., a reimbursable arrangement where NASA pays a share of incurred costs, regardless of the accomplishment of tangible milestones) must be approved through the deviation process discussed in 1274.106.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Date of completion.</E> The date on which all work under an award is completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement or amendment thereto, on which NASA sponsorship ends.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Days.</E> Calendar days, unless otherwise indicated.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Government furnished equipment.</E> Equipment in the possession of, or acquired directly by, the Government and subsequently delivered, or otherwise made available, to a recipient and equipment procured by the recipient with Government funds under a cooperative agreement. In most cases, Government furnished equipment will be counted as part of the Government's in-kind or non-cash contributions to the cooperative agreement for the purpose of determining the share ratio.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Incremental funding.</E> A method of funding a cooperative agreement where the funds initially allotted to the cooperative agreement are less than the award amount. Additional funding is added as described in § 1274.918.<PRTPAGE P="297"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Non-cash or in-kind contributions.</E> May be in the form of personnel resources (where cost accounting methods allow accumulation of such costs), real property, equipment, supplies and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or program. Costs incurred by NASA to provide the services of one of its support contractors to perform part of NASA's requirements under a cooperative agreement shall be included as part of NASA's cost share, and will be counted as an in-kind contribution to the cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Recipient.</E> An organization receiving financial assistance under a cooperative agreement to carry out a project or program. A recipient may be an individual firm, including sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, or a consortium of business entities.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Research misconduct</E> is defined in 14 CFR 1275.101. NASA policies and procedures regarding Research misconduct are set out in 14 CFR part 1275, “Investigation of Research Misconduct.”</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Resource contributions.</E> The total value of resources provided by either party to the cooperative agreement including both cash and non-cash contributions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Subcontracting dollar threshold.</E> The dollar amount of the cooperative agreement subject to the small business subcontracting policies (includes small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, historically underutilized small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and minority educational institutions). For cooperative agreements, the dollar threshold to which the small business subcontracting policies apply, is established by the total amount of NASA's cash contributions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Suspension.</E> An action by NASA or the recipient that temporarily discontinues efforts under an award, pending corrective action or pending a decision to terminate the award.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Technical officer.</E> The official of the cognizant NASA office who is responsible for monitoring the technical aspects of the work under a cooperative agreement. A Contracting Officer's Technical Representative may serve as a Technical Officer.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Termination.</E> The cancellation of a cooperative agreement in whole or in part, by either party at any time prior to the date of completion.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review requirements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Once the decision is made by a Headquarters program office or Center procurement personnel, to pursue the Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) process, for which the total NASA resources to be expended equal or exceed $10 million (cash plus non-cash contributions), a notification shall immediately be provided to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS). The notification(s) shall be forwarded by the cognizant Headquarters program office or the Center procurement office (as applicable). For any CAN where NASA's <E T="03">cash</E> contributions are expected to equal or exceed $10 million, Headquarters program office or Center procurement personnel shall also notify the Assistant Administrator for Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (Code K). All such notifications, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, shall evidence concurrence by the cognizant Center Procurement Officer. These review requirements also apply where an unsolicited proposal is received from a commercial firm (or from a team of recipients where one of more team members is a commercial firm), and the planned award document is a cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) The notification shall be accomplished by sending an electronic mail (e-mail) message to the following address at NASA Headquarters: <PRTPAGE P="298"/>
              <E T="03">can@hq.nasa.gov.</E> The notification must include the following information, as a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identification of the cognizant Center and program office;</P>
            <P>(2) Description of the proposed program for which proposals are to be solicited;</P>
            <P>(3) Rationale for decision to use a CAN rather than other types of solicitations;</P>
            <P>(4) The amount of Government funding to be available for award(s);</P>
            <P>(5) Estimate of the number of cooperative agreements to be awarded as a result of the CAN;</P>
            <P>(6) The percentage of cost-sharing to be required;</P>
            <P>(7) Tentative schedule for release of CAN and award of cooperative agreements;</P>
            <P>(8) If the term of the cooperative agreement is anticipated to exceed 3 years and/or if the Government cash contribution is expected to exceed $20M, address anticipated changes, if any, to the provisions (see § 1274.207); and</P>
            <P>(9) If the cooperative agreement is for programs/projects that provide aerospace products or capabilities, (e.g., provision of space and aeronautics systems, flight and ground systems, technologies and operations), a statement that the requirements of NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 7120.4 and NASA Policy Guidance (NPG) 7120.5 have been met. This affirmative statement will include a specific reference to the signed Program Commitment Agreement.</P>
            <P>(c) Code HS will respond by e-mail message to the sender, with a copy of the message to the Procurement Officer and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, within five (5) working days of receipt of this initial notification. The response will address the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether Code HS agrees or disagrees with the appropriateness for using a CAN for the effort described,</P>
            <P>(2) Whether Code HS will require review and approval of the CAN before its issuance,</P>
            <P>(3) Whether Code HS will require review and approval of the selected offeror's cost sharing arrangement (e.g., cost sharing percentage; type of contribution (cash, labor, etc.)).</P>
            <P>(4) Whether Code HS will require review and approval of the resulting cooperative agreement(s).</P>
            <P>(d) If a response from Code HS is not received within 5 working days of notification, the program office or Center may proceed with release of the CAN and award of the cooperative agreements as described.</P>
            <P>(e) Before issuance, each field-generated CAN shall be approved by the installation director or designee, with the concurrence of the procurement officer. Each Headquarters generated CAN shall be approved by the cognizant Program Associate Administrator or designee, with concurrence of the Headquarters Offices of General Counsel (Code GK), External Relations (Code I), Safety &amp; Mission Assurance (Code Q), and Procurement (Code HS).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Solicitations/cooperative agreement notices.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Agreement officers should use every effort to issue draft pre-award cooperative agreement information. Any draft documentation released for comment shall contain all factors/subfactors. Draft documents should be as close to the final product as possible. Draft Cooperative Agreement Notices (CAN's) or Cooperative Agreements (CA) should include terms and conditions, special requirements and expected cash and non-cash (in-kind) contributions.</P>
            <P>(1) Publication of draft documentation may serve to prevent unnecessary expenditure of resources and unproductive time that may be spent by NASA and potential recipients. Release of draft documentation also serves to assist NASA in refining program objectives and requirements, and maximizes the quality of research proposals submitted for formal evaluation and source selection.</P>
            <P>(2) During the information gathering process, comments may be invited from potential recipients on all aspects of the draft documentation, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions and evaluation approaches. Potential recipients should be specifically requested to identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements. Comments should also be requested on any perceived safety, occupational health, security (including information technology security), environmental, export control, and/or other programmatic risk issues associated with performance of the CA.</P>
            <P>(3) Agreement officers should include in the award schedule adequate time for the process to include industry review and comments, and NASA's evaluation and disposition of comments received.</P>

            <P>(4) When providing draft documents for comment, the draft CAN shall advise interested parties that any issued draft documentation shall not be considered as a solicitation for award, and that NASA is not requesting proposals in response to the draft publication.<PRTPAGE P="300"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) Whenever feasible, agreement officers should include a summary of the disposition of significant comments when issuing the final CAN and/or CA.</P>
            <P>(b) The evaluation section of the CAN shall notify potential recipients of the relative importance of factors, and any subfactors or other criteria that will be evaluated during the selection process.</P>
            <P>(c) For its research projects, NASA may publish the expected project goals and objectives in terms of “What” the commercial recipient is expected to accomplish. The commercial recipient may be required to submit a proposed statement of work with its proposal stating “How” the recipient will accomplish the task(s). Depending on its importance to the success of the project, for some projects the recipient's statement of work may be included as an evaluation criterion for award. In these instances, the requirement for submission of the recipient's statement of work will be clearly identified as a subfactor or criterion that will be evaluated, and its relative weight or ranking in relation to other evaluation criteria shall be stated. In all cases, where the recipient submits a statement of work in response to NASA project objectives, NASA shall have final approval of the acceptability of the statement of work.</P>
            <P>(d) Where performance-based milestone payments are planned, the potential recipient should be encouraged to suggest in its statement of work (which incorporates the project goals and objectives), or elsewhere in its proposal, terms and/or performance events upon which milestone payments can be negotiated.</P>
            <P>(e) The CAN should provide a description and value for any quantifiable non-cash or in-kind Government resources (personnel, equipment, facilities, etc.), in addition to any cash funds that will be offered by the Government as part of its contributions to the cooperative agreement. As part of its proposal package, the recipient may also identify additional non-cash or in-kind resources it wishes NASA to contribute. The recipient shall verify the suitability of the requested resource(s) to the work to be performed under the cooperative agreement. Any additional verifiable and suitable non-cash or in-kind resources requested, shall be added to NASA's shared cost of performing the cooperative agreement, and may require increased cash or in-kind contributions from the recipient to meet its percentage of the cost share.</P>
            <P>(f) To protect the integrity of the competitive process, upon release of the formal CAN the agreement officer shall direct that all personnel associated with the source selection refrain from communicating with prospective recipients and to refer all inquiries to the agreement officer or other authorized representative. The notification to potential recipients may be sent in any format (e.g., letter or electronic) appropriate to the complexity of the acquisition. It is not intended that all communication with potential recipients be terminated. Agreement officers should continue to provide information as long as it does not create an unfair competitive advantage or reveal proprietary data.</P>
            <P>(g) If NASA anticipates that the total Federal share of any award made under a funding agreement may exceed, over the period of performance, the simplified acquisition threshold, the notice of funding opportunity must include the information as required in Appendix 1 to Part 200, paragraph E.3, paragraph E.4, and paragraph F.3.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Costs and payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Cost allowability.</E> (1) Cooperative agreements awarded to commercial firms are subject to the cost accounting standards and principles of 48 CFR Chapter 99, as implemented by FAR Parts 30 and 31.</P>
            <P>(2) If the recipient is a consortium which includes non-commercial entities as members, cost allowability for those members will be determined as follows:</P>

            <P>(i) Allowability of costs incurred by state, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.”<PRTPAGE P="301"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.”</P>
            <P>(iii) The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational nstitutions.”</P>
            <P>(iv) The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.”</P>
            <P>(3) A recipient's method for accounting for the expenditure of funds must be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost sharing.</E> (1) Given the mutually beneficial nature of, in particular, potential commercially marketable products expected to result from the research activities of the cooperative agreement, resource contributions are required from the recipient. The commercial recipient is expected to contribute at least 50 percent of the total resources necessary to accomplish the cooperative agreement effort. Recipient contributions may be cash, non-cash (in-kind) or both. Acceptable non-cash or in-kind resources include such items as equipment, facilities, labor, office space, etc. In determining the incentive to the recipient to share costs, agreement officers must consider a variety of factors. For example, while the future profitability of intellectual property may serve as an incentive for involvement of the commercial firm in the cooperative agreement, the actual or imputed value of such items as patent rights, data rights, trade secrets, etc., included in intellectual property is generally not considered a reliable source for computation of the recipient's contributions.</P>
            <P>(2) In most cases these costs are not readily quantifiable. Thus, although the value of intellectual property rights should be factored into the incentive for the recipient to share at least 50 percent of costs, intellectual property rights do not serve as quantifiable amounts to determine the equitable dollar amounts of costs to be shared.</P>
            <P>(3) As is expected from the commercial partner, the Government's cost share should reflect certain non-cash as well as cash contributions to the most practicable extent possible. Where quantifiable, NASA will include in the calculation of the Government's cost share, non-cash or in-kind contributions, which includes the value of equipment, personnel, and facilities. Costs incurred by NASA to provide the services of one or more support contractors to perform part of NASA's requirements under a cooperative agreement will be counted as part of NASA's in-kind contributions. This approach is also supported by the initiative to implement full cost accounting methods within the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>(4) When other Government agencies act as partners along with NASA (e.g., Department of Defense or Federal Aviation Administration), the resources contributed by any Government agency shall be counted as part of the Government's total cost share under the cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(5) For every cooperative agreement, there should be evidence of the recipient's strong commitment and self-interest in the success of the research project. A very strong indicator of a recipient's self-interest is the willingness to commit to a meaningful level of cost sharing (i.e., 50 percent). Before considering whether it is impracticable for the recipient to share at least 50% of the performance costs, agreement officers should also consider whether other factors exist that demonstrate the recipient's financial stake or self-interest in the success of the cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(6) In cases where a contribution of less than 50 percent is anticipated from the commercial recipient, approval of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) is required prior to award. The request for approval should address the evaluation factor in the solicitation and how the proposal accomplishes those objectives to such a degree that a share ratio of less than 50 percent is warranted.</P>

            <P>(7) Once accepted for application to costs shared under the cooperative <PRTPAGE P="302"/>agreement, cash and in-kind contributions including Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) costs, may not be included as contributions for any other federally assisted project or program.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fixed funding.</E> (1) Cooperative agreements are funded by NASA through the disbursement of agreed upon fixed payment amounts to the recipient. NASA makes disbursement of funds to the recipient as “Milestone payments” discussed in paragraph (d) of this section. If the recipient achieves the final milestone, final payment is made, which completes NASA's financial responsibilities under the agreement.</P>
            <P>(2) Fixed payments on a cooperative agreement are made by NASA based on the accomplishment by the recipient of predetermined tangible milestones. Any arrangement where payments are made on a basis other than accomplished tangible milestones must be approved in accordance with the requirements of § 1274.106 Deviations.</P>
            <P>(3) If the cooperative agreement is terminated prior to achievement of all milestones, NASA's funding is limited to milestone payments already made plus NASA's share of costs incurred to meet commitments of the recipient, which had in the judgment of NASA become firm prior to the effective date of termination. In no event, however, shall the amount of NASA's share of these additional costs exceed the amount of the next scheduled milestone payment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Milestone obligations and payments.</E> Agreement officers, technical officers, accounting and finance officials, and all other responsible NASA personnel shall ensure that funds for milestone payments are obligated, billed and expended in accordance with the guidance set forth by the NASA Financial Management Manual (FMM 9000).</P>
            <P>(1) There must always be sufficient funds obligated to cover the next milestone payment. In addition, funds must be made available (but not necessarily obligated) to cover all milestone payments expected to be made during the current fiscal year of performance.</P>
            <P>(2) Disbursement of funds to the recipient is based on the achievement of milestones or performance-related benchmarks. The milestone must represent the accomplishment of verifiable, significant event(s) and may not be based upon the mere passage of time or the performance of a particular level of effort. The Government technical officer must verify to and advise the agreement officer that each milestone has been achieved prior to authorizing the corresponding payment.</P>
            <P>(3) The amount of funds to be disbursed by NASA in recognition of the achievement of milestones (“milestone payments”) shall be established consistent with the ratio of resource sharing agreed upon under the cooperative agreement (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section). While the schedule for milestone achievement must reflect the project being undertaken, the frequency should not be greater than one payment per month. For many projects, scheduling milestones to be accomplished about every 60 to 90 days appears to be most workable. Partial or interim milestone payments may not be made.</P>
            <P>(4) The final milestone payment should be structured so that the associated payment is large enough to provide incentive to the recipient to complete its responsibilities under the cooperative agreement. Alternatively, funds may be reserved for disbursement after completion of the effort.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Incremental funding.</E> Whenever the period of performance for the cooperative agreement crosses fiscal years, the agreement shall be incrementally funded using appropriations from different fiscal years. In other circumstances, incremental funding may be appropriate. The total amount of funds obligated during the course of a fiscal year must be sufficient to cover the Government's share of the costs anticipated to be incurred by the recipient during that fiscal year. NASA may allot funds to an agreement at various times during a fiscal year in anticipation of the occurrence of costs. However, there must always be sufficient funds obligated to cover all milestone payments expected to be made during the current fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Profit applicability.</E> Recipients shall not be paid a profit under cooperative agreements. Profit may be paid by the recipient to subcontractors, if <PRTPAGE P="303"/>the subcontractor is not part of the offering team and the subcontract is an arms-length relationship. All entities that are involved in performing the research and development effort that is the purpose of the cooperative agreement shall be part of the recipient's consortium and not subcontractors.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) costs.</E> When determining the applicable dollar amounts or reasonableness of proposed IR&amp;D costs to be included as part of the recipient's cost share, agreement officers should seek assistance from DCAA or the cognizant audit agency.</P>
            <P>(1) In accordance with FAR 31.205-18(e), IR&amp;D costs may include costs contributed by contractors in performing cooperative research and development agreements or similar arrangements, entered into under sections 203(c)(5) and (6) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(5) and (6)). IR&amp;D costs incurred by a contractor pursuant to these types of cooperative agreements should be considered as allowable IR&amp;D costs if the work performed would have been allowed as contractor IR&amp;D had there been no cooperative arrangement.</P>
            <P>(2) IR&amp;D costs (or an agreed upon portion of IR&amp;D costs) incurred by the recipient's organization and deemed by NASA as the same type of research being undertaken by the cooperative agreement between NASA and the recipient may serve as part of the recipient's contribution of shared costs under the cooperative agreement. When considering the use of IR&amp;D costs as part of the recipient's cost share, the IR&amp;D costs offered by the recipient shall meet the requirements of FAR 31.205-18. Any IR&amp;D costs incurred in a prior period, and offered as part of the recipient's cost share shall meet the criteria established by FAR 31.205-18(d), Deferred IR&amp;D Costs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Consortia as recipients.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The use of consortia as recipients for cooperative agreements is encouraged. Such arrangements tend to bring a broader range of capabilities and resources to the cooperative agreement. In addition, consortium members can better share the projects financial costs (e.g., the 50 percent recipient's cost share or other costs of performance).</P>
            <P>(b) NASA enters into an agreement with only one entity (as identified by the consortium members). (Also see § 1274.940.) The inclusion of non-profit or educational institutions, small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses in the consortium could be particularly valuable in ensuring that the results of the consortium's activities are disseminated.</P>
            <P>(c) Key to the success of the cooperative agreement with a consortium is the consortium's Articles of Collaboration, which is a definitive description of the roles and responsibilities of the consortium's members. The Articles of Collaboration must designate a lead firm to represent the consortium and authority to sign on the consortium's behalf. It should also address to the extent appropriate—</P>
            <P>(1) Commitments of financial, personnel, facilities and other resources;</P>
            <P>(2) A detailed milestone chart of consortium activities;</P>

            <P>(13) The firm that is responsible for the completion of the consortium's responsibilities under the cooperative agreement and has the authority to commit the consortium and receive payments from NASA, and address employee policy or other personnel issues.</P>
            <P>(d) The consortium's charter or by-laws may be substituted for the Articles of Collaboration only if they are inclusive of all of the required information.</P>

            <P>(e) An outline of the Articles of Collaboration should be required as part of the proposal and evaluated during the source selection process. Articles of <PRTPAGE P="304"/>Collaboration do not become part of the resulting cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) Cooperative agreements that will exceed $5 million and have a period of performance in excess of 5 years shall require the approval of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement prior to award. Requests for approval shall include a justification for exceeding 5 years and evidence that the extended years can be reasonably priced. Requests for approval are not required when the 5-year limitation is exceeded due to a no cost extension.</P>
            <P>(c) Cooperative agreement renewals provide for the continuation of research beyond the original scope, period of performance and funding levels; therefore, new proposals, certifications, and technical evaluations are required prior to the execution of a cooperative agreement renewal. Renewals will be awarded as new cooperative agreements. Continued performance within a period specified under a multiple year cooperative agreement provision does not constitute a renewal.</P>
            <P>(d) The provisions set forth in § 1274.901 are generally considered appropriate for agreements not exceeding 3 years and/or a Government cash contribution not exceeding $20M. For cooperative agreements expected to be longer than 3 years and/or involve Government cash contributions exceeding $20M, consideration should be given to provisions which place additional restrictions on the recipient in terms of validating performance and accounting for funds expended.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Intellectual property rights.</E> A cooperative agreement covers the disposition of rights to intellectual property between NASA and the recipient.

            <P>(4) NASA Support Contractor Inventions; and</P>
            <P>(5) Joint Inventions with Recipient.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Recipient inventions.</E> (1) A recipient, if a large business, is subject to section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2457) relating to property rights in inventions. The term “invention” includes any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation. Title to an invention made under a cooperative agreement by a large business recipient initially vests with NASA. The recipient may request a waiver under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations to obtain title to inventions made under the agreement. Such a request may be made in advance of the agreement (or 30 days thereafter) for all inventions made under the agreement. Alternatively, requests may be made on a case-by-case basis any time an individual invention is made. Such waivers are liberally and expeditiously granted after review by NASA's Invention and Contribution Board and approval by <PRTPAGE P="305"/>NASA's General Counsel. When a waiver is granted, any inventions made in the performance of work under the agreement are subject to certain reporting, election and filing requirements, a royalty-free license to the Government, march-in rights, and certain other reservations.</P>
            <P>(2) A recipient, if a small business or nonprofit organization, may elect to retain title to its inventions. The term “nonprofit organization” is defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(i) and includes universities and other institutions of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Government obtains an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Subcontractor inventions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Large business.</E> If a recipient enters into a subcontract (or similar arrangement) with a large business organization for experimental, developmental, research, design or engineering work in support of the agreement to be performed in the United States, its possessions, or Puerto Rico, section 305 of the Space Act applies. The clause applicable to large business organizations is to be used (suitably modified to identify the parties) in any subcontract. The subcontractor may request a waiver under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations to obtain rights to inventions made under the subcontract just as a large business recipient can (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section). It is strongly recommended that a prospective large business subcontractor contact the NASA installation Patent Counsel or Intellectual Property Counsel to assure that the right procedures are followed. Just like the recipient, any inventions made in the performance of work under the agreement are subject to certain reporting, election and filing requirements, a royalty-free license to the Government, march-in rights, and certain other reservations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-profit organization or small business.</E> In the event the recipient enters into a subcontract (or similar arrangement) with a domestic nonprofit organization or a small business firm for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed under the agreement, the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 200 <E T="03">et seq.</E> regarding “Patent Rights in Inventions Made With Federal Assistance,” apply. The subcontractor has the first option to elect title to any inventions made in the performance of work under the agreement, subject to specific reporting, election and filing requirements, a royalty-free license to the Government, march-in rights, and certain other reservations that are specifically set forth.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Work outside the United States.</E> If the recipient subcontracts for work to be done outside the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, the NASA installation Patent Counsel or Intellectual Property Counsel should be contacted for the proper patent rights clause to use and the procedures to follow.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and in recognition of the recipient's substantial contribution, the recipient is authorized, subject to rights of NASA set forth elsewhere in the agreement, to:</P>
            <P>(i) Acquire by negotiation and mutual agreement rights to a subcontractor's subject inventions as the recipient may deem necessary; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If unable to reach agreement pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, request that NASA invoke exceptional circumstances as necessary pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2) if the prospective subcontractor is a small business firm or nonprofit organization, or for all other organizations, request that such rights for the recipient be included as an additional reservation in a waiver granted pursuant to 14 CFR 1245.1. The exercise of this exception does not change the flow down of the applicable patent rights clause to subcontractors. Applicable laws and regulations require that title to inventions made under a subcontract must initially reside in either the subcontractor or NASA, not the recipient. This exception does not change that. The exception does authorize the recipient to negotiate and reach mutual agreement with the subcontractor for the grant-back of rights. Such grant-back could be an option for an exclusive license or an assignment, depending on the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">NASA inventions.</E> NASA will use reasonable efforts to report inventions <PRTPAGE P="306"/>made by its employees as a consequence of, or which bear a direct relation to, the performance of specified NASA activities under an agreement. Upon timely request, NASA will use its best efforts to a grant recipient first option to acquire either an exclusive or partially-exclusive, revocable, royalty-bearing license, on terms to be negotiated, for any patent applications and patents covering such inventions. This exclusive or partially-exclusive license to the recipient will be subject to the retention of rights by or on behalf of the Government for Government purposes.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">NASA support contractor inventions.</E> It is preferred that NASA support contractors be excluded from performing any of NASA's responsibilities under an agreement since the rights obtained by a NASA support contractor could work against the rights needed by the recipient. In the event NASA support contractors are tasked by NASA to work under the agreement and inventions are made by support contractor employees, the support contractor will normally retain title to its employee inventions in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, 14 CFR part 1245, and E.O. 12591. In the event the recipient decides not to pursue right to title in any such invention and NASA obtains title to such inventions, upon timely request, NASA will use its best efforts to grant the recipient first option to acquire either an exclusive or partially exclusive, revocable, royalty-bearing license, upon terms to be negotiated, for any patent applications and patents covering such inventions. This exclusive or partially-exclusive license to the recipient will be subject to the retention of rights by or on behalf of the Government for Government purposes.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Joint inventions.</E> (1) NASA and the recipient agree to use reasonable efforts to identify and report to each other any inventions made jointly between NASA employees (or employees of NASA support contractors) and employees of Recipient. For large businesses, the Associate General Counsel (Intellectual Property) may agree that the United States will refrain, for a specified period, from exercising its undivided interest in a manner inconsistent with the recipient's commercial interest. For small business firms and nonprofit organizations, the Associate General Counsel (Intellectual Property) may agree to assign or transfer whatever rights NASA may acquire in a subject invention from its employee to the recipient as authorized by 35 U.S.C. 202(e). The agreement officer negotiating the agreement with small business firms and nonprofit organizations can agree, up front, that NASA will assign whatever rights it may acquire in a subject invention from its employee to the small business firm or nonprofit organization. Requests under this paragraph shall be made through the Center Patent Counsel.</P>
            <P>(2) NASA support contractors may be joint inventors. If a NASA support contractor employee is a joint inventor with a NASA employee, the same provisions apply as those for NASA support contractor inventions (see paragraph (g) of this section). The NASA support contractor will retain or obtain nonexclusive licenses to those inventions in which NASA obtains title. If a NASA support contractor employee is a joint inventor with a recipient employee, the NASA support contractor and recipient will become joint owners of those inventions in which they have elected to retain title or requested and have been granted waiver of title. Where the NASA support contractor has not elected to retain title or has not been granted waiver of title, NASA will jointly own the invention with the Recipient.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Licenses to recipient(s).</E> (1) Any exclusive or partially exclusive commercial licenses are to be royalty-bearing consistent with Government-wide policy in licensing its inventions. It also provides an opportunity for royalty-sharing with the employee-inventor, consistent with Government-wide policy under the Federal Technology Transfer Act.</P>

            <P>(2) Upon application in compliance with 37 CFR Part 404—Licensing of Government Owned Inventions, all recipients shall be granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention and any <PRTPAGE P="307"/>resulting patent in which the Government obtains title. Because cooperative agreements are cost sharing cooperative arrangements with a purpose of benefiting the public by improving the competitiveness of the recipient and the Government receives an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each recipient subject invention, it is only equitable that the recipient receive, at a minimum, a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in NASA inventions and NASA contractor inventions where NASA has acquired title.</P>

            <P>(3) Once a recipient has exercised its option to apply for an exclusive or partially exclusive license, a notice, identifying the invention and the recipient, is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> providing the public opportunity for filing written objections for 60 days.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Preference for United States manufacture.</E> Despite any other provision, the recipient agrees that any products embodying subject inventions or produced through the use of subject inventions shall be manufactured substantially in the United States. “Manufactured substantially in the United States” means the product must have over 50 percent of its components manufactured in the United States. This requirement is met if the cost to the recipient of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all components required to make the product. In making this determination, only the product and its components shall be considered. The cost of each component includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the product and any applicable duty whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which determinations have been made in accordance with FAR 25.101(a) are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic. The intent of this provision is to support manufacturing jobs in the United States regardless of the status of the recipient as a domestic or foreign controlled company. However, in individual cases, the requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States, may be waived by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) upon a showing by the recipient that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Space Act agreements.</E> Invention and patent rights in cooperative agreements must comply with statutory and regulatory provisions. Where circumstances permit, a Space Act Agreement is available as an alternative instrument which can be more flexible in the area of invention and patent rights.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Data rights.</E> Data rights provisions can and should be tailored to best achieve the needs and objectives of the respective parties concerned.</P>
            <P>(1) The data rights clause at § 1274.905 assumes a substantially equal cost sharing relationship where collaborative research, experimental, developmental, engineering, demonstration, or design activities are to be carried out, such that it is likely that “proprietary” information will be developed and/or exchanged under the agreement. If cost sharing is unequal or no extensive research, experimental, developmental, engineering, demonstration, or design activities are likely, a different set of clauses may be appropriate.</P>

            <P>(2) The primary question that must be answered when developing data clauses is what does each party need or intend to do with the data developed under the agreement. Accordingly, the data rights clauses may be tailored to fit the circumstances. Where conflicting goals of the parties result in incompatible data provisions, agreement officers for the Government must recognize that private companies entering into cooperative agreements bring resources to that relationship and must be allowed to reap an appropriate benefit for the expenditure of those resources. However, since serving a public purpose is a major objective of a cooperative agreement, care must be exercised to ensure the recipient is not established as a long term sole source supplier of an item or service and is not in a position to take unfair advantage of the results of the cooperative agreement. Therefore, a reasonable time period (i.e., depending on the technology, two to five years after production of the data) may be established <PRTPAGE P="308"/>after which the data first produced by the recipient in the performance of the agreement will be made public.</P>
            <P>(3) Data can be generated from different sources and can have various restrictions placed on its dissemination. Recipient data furnished to NASA can exist prior to, or be produced outside of, the agreement or be produced under the agreement. NASA can also produce data in carrying out its responsibilities under the agreement. Each of these areas must be covered.</P>
            <P>(4) For data, including software, first produced by the recipient under the agreement, the recipient may assert copyright. Data exchanged with a notice showing that the data is protected by copyright must include appropriate licenses in order for NASA to use the data as needed.</P>
            <P>(5) Recognizing that the dissemination of the results of NASA's activities is a primary objective of a cooperative agreement, the parties should specifically delineate what results will be published and under what conditions. This should be set forth in the clause of the cooperative agreement entitled “Publication and Reports: Non-Proprietary Research Results.” Any such agreement on the publication of results should be stated to take precedence over any other clause in the cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(6) Section 1274.905(b)(3) requires the recipient to provide NASA a government purpose license for data first produced by the Recipient that constitutes trade secrets or confidential business or financial information. NASA and the recipient shall determine the scope of this license at the time of award of the cooperative agreement. In addition to the purposes given as examples in § 1274.905(b)(3), the license should provide NASA the right to use this data under a separate cooperative agreement or contract issued to a party other than the recipient for the purpose of continuing the project in the event the cooperative agreement is terminated by either party.</P>
            <P>(7) In accordance with section 303(b) of the Space Act, any data first produced by NASA under the agreement which embodies trade secrets or financial information that would be privileged or confidential if it had been obtained from a private participant, will be marked with an appropriate legend and maintained in confidence for an agreed to period of up to five years (the maximum allowed by law). This does not apply to data other than that for which there has been agreement regarding publication or distribution. The period of time during which data first produced by NASA is maintained in confidence should be consistent with the period of time determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, before which data first produced by the recipient will be made public. Also, NASA itself may use the marked data (under suitable protective conditions) for agreed-to purposes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Evaluation and selection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Factor development.</E> The agreement officer, along with the NASA evaluation team has discretion to determine the relevant evaluation criteria based upon the project requirements, and the goals and objectives of the cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Communications during non-competitive awards.</E> For cooperative agreements awarded non-competitively (see § 1274.202(b)), there are no restrictions on communications between NASA and the recipient. In addition, there is no requirement for the development and publication of formal evaluation or source selection criteria.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Communications during competitive awards.</E> As discussed in § 1274.203(c), when a competitive source selection process will be followed to select the recipient, an appropriate level of care shall be taken by NASA personnel in order to protect the integrity of the source selection process. Therefore, upon release of the formal cooperative agreement notice (CAN), the agreement officer shall direct all procurement personnel associated with the source selection to refrain from communicating with prospective recipients and that all inquiries be referred to the agreement officer, or other authorized representative.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Selection factors and subfactors.</E> (1) At a minimum, the selection process for the competitive award of cooperative agreements to commercial entities shall include evaluation of potential <PRTPAGE P="309"/>recipients' proposals for merit and relevance to NASA's mission requirements through their responses to the publication of NASA evaluation factors. The evaluation factors should include technical and management capabilities (mission suitability), past performance, and proposed costs (including proposed cost share).</P>
            <P>(2) For programs that may involve potentially hazardous operations related to flight, and/or mission critical ground systems, NASA's selection factors and subfactors shall provide for evaluation of the recipient's proposed approach to managing risk (e.g., technology being applied or developed, technical complexity, performance specifications and tolerances, delivery schedule, etc.).</P>
            <P>(3) As part of the evaluation process, the factors, subfactors, or other criteria should be tailored to properly address the requirements of the cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) Prior to making a Federal award, agreement officers are required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 note, to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of governmentwide eligibility qualification, currently the System of Award Management (SAM), or financial integrity information (currently Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)), as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR part 180 as well as individual Federal agency suspension and debarment regulations in title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 2313, agreement officers are required to review the non-public segment of FAPIIS prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. NASA may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with 2 CFR 200.207, Specific conditions.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Other factors and subfactors.</E> Other factors and subfactors may include—</P>
            <P>(1) The composition or appropriateness of the business relationship of proposed team members or consortium, articles of collaboration, participation of an appropriate mix of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, historically underutilized small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned business concerns, as well as non-profits and educational institutions, including historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions).</P>
            <P>(2) Other considerations may include enhancing U.S. competitiveness, developing a capability among U.S. firms, identification of potential markets, appropriateness of business risks.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Proposal evaluation.</E> The proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria published in the CAN. Proposals selected for award will be supported by documentation as described in 1274.211(b). When evaluation results in a proposal not being selected, the proposer will be notified in accordance with the CAN.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Technical evaluation.</E> The technical evaluation of proposals may include peer reviews. Because the business sense of a cooperative agreement proposal is critical to its success, NASA may reserve the right to utilize appropriate outside evaluators to assist in the evaluation of such proposal elements as the business base projections, the market for proposed products, and/or the impact of anticipated product price reductions.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Cost/price evaluation.</E> (1) Prior to award of a cooperative agreement, agreement officers shall ensure that proposed costs are accurate and reasonable. In order to do so, cost and pricing data may be required. The level of cost and pricing data to be requested shall be commensurate with the analysis <PRTPAGE P="310"/>necessary to reach agreement on overall proposed project costs. The evaluation of costs shall lead to the determination and verification of total project costs to be shared by NASA and the recipient, as well as establishment of NASA's milestone payment schedule based on its 50 percent cost share. The guidance at FAR 15.4 and NFS 1815.4 can assist in determining whether cost and pricing data are necessary and the level of analysis required. While competition may be present (i.e., more than one proposal is received), in most cases companies are proposing competing technologies and varying approaches that reflect very different methods (and accompanying costs) to satisfy NASA's project objectives. Consequently, this type of competitive environment is very different from an environment where competitive proposals are submitted in response to a request for proposals leading to award of a contract for relatively well-defined program or project requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) During evaluation of the cost proposal, the agreement officer, along with other NASA evaluation team members and/or pricing support personnel, shall determine the reasonableness of the overall proposed project costs, including verifying the value of the recipient's proposed non-cash and in-kind contributions. Commitments should be obtained and verified to the extent practicable from the recipient or any associated team members, from which proposed contributions will be made.</P>
            <P>(3) If the recipient's proposed contributions include application of IR&amp;D costs, see § 1274.204(g).</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Awards to foreign governments and firms.</E> (1) An award may not be made to a foreign government. However, if selected as the best available source, an award may be made to a foreign firm. If a proposal is selected from a foreign firm sponsored by their respective government agency, or from entities considered quasi-governmental, approval must be obtained from Headquarters, Program Operations Division (Code HS). Such requests must include detailed rationale for the selection, to include the funding source of the foreign participant. The approval of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement is required to exclude foreign firms from submitting proposals. Award to a foreign firm shall be on a no-exchange-of-funds basis (see NPD 1360.2).</P>
            <P>(2) The Office of External Affairs (Code I), shall be notified prior to any announcement of intent to award to a foreign firm. Additionally, pursuant to section 126 of Pub. L. 106-391, as part of the evaluation of costs and benefits of entering into an obligation to conduct a space mission in which a foreign entity will participate as a supplier of the spacecraft, spacecraft system, or launch system, NASA shall solicit comment on the potential impact of such participation, through notice published in the FedBizOpps or NAIS.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Safe-guarding proposals.</E> Competitive proposal information shall be protected in accordance with FAR 15.207, Handling proposals and information. Unsolicited proposals shall be protected in accordance with FAR 15.608, Prohibitions, and FAR 15.609, Limited use of data.</P>
            <P>(1) Evaluation team members, the source selection authority, and agreement officers are responsible for protecting sensitive information on the award of a grant or cooperative agreement and for determining who is authorized to receive such information. Sensitive information includes: information contained in proposals; information prepared for NASA's evaluation of proposals; the rankings of proposals for an award; reports and evaluations of source selection panels, boards, or advisory councils; and other information deemed sensitive by the source selection authority or by the agreement officer.</P>

            <P>(2) No sensitive information shall be disclosed to persons not on the evaluation team or evaluation panel, unless the Selecting Official or the agreement officer has approved disclosure based upon an unequivocal “need-to-know” and the individual receiving the information has signed a Non-Disclosure Certificate. All attendees at formal source selection presentations and briefings shall be required to sign an Attendance Roster and a Disclosure Certificate. The attendance rosters and certificates shall be maintained in official files for a minimum of six months after award.<PRTPAGE P="311"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The improper disclosure of sensitive information could result in criminal prosecution or an adverse action.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Controls on the use of outside evaluators.</E> The use of outside evaluators shall be approved in accordance with NFS 1815.207-70(b). A cover sheet with the following legend shall be affixed to data provided to outside evaluators:</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Government Notice for Handling Proposals</HD>
            <P>This proposal shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes only, and a copy of this Government notice shall be applied to any reproduction or abstract thereof. Any authorized restrictive notices which the submitter places on this proposal shall also be strictly complied with.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Printing, binding, and duplicating.</E> Proposals for efforts that involve printing, binding, and duplicating in excess of 25,000 pages are subject to the regulations of the Congressional Joint Committee on Printing. The technical office will refer such proposals to the Installation Central Printing Management Officer (ICPMO) to ensure compliance with NPD 1490.1. The Agreement Officer will be advised in writing of the results of the ICPMO review.</P>

Registration is required in order to obtain a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, which will be used as a grant and cooperative agreement identification number for the new system. The agreement officer shall verify that the prospective awardee is registered in the SAM database using the DUNS number or, if applicable, the DUNS+4 number, via the Internet at <E T="03">https://www.sam.gov</E>.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certifications, Disclosures, and Assurances.</E> (1) Agreement officers are required to ensure that all necessary certifications, disclosures, and assurances have been obtained prior to awarding a cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(2) Each new proposal shall include a certification for debarment and suspension under the requirements of 2 CFR 180.510 and 1260.117.</P>

            <P>(a) If NASA does not make a Federal award to a non-Federal entity because the agreement officer determines that the non-Federal entity does not meet either or both of the minimum qualification standards, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of 2 CFR 200.205, the agreement officer must report that determination in FAPIIS, accessible through SAM, only if all of the following apply:</P>

            <P>(1) The only basis for the determination described in paragraph (a) of this section is the non-Federal entity's prior record of executing programs or activities under Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of 2 CFR 200.205, (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the entity was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two standards); and</P>
            <P>(2) The total Federal share of the Federal award that otherwise would be made to the non-Federal entity is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance.</P>
            <P>(b) Agreement officers are not required to report a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award if they make the Federal award to the non-Federal entity and includes specific award terms and conditions (see § 1274.209).</P>
            <P>(c) If the agreement officer reports a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the agreement officer also must notify the non-Federal entity that—</P>
            <P>(1) The determination was made and reported to FAPIIS, accessible through SAM, and include with the notification an explanation of the basis for the determination;</P>
            <P>(2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the determination, as required by section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313), then archived;</P>

            <P>(3) Agreement officers making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period must consider the information found in FAPIIS when judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award when the total Federal share of the Federal award is expected <PRTPAGE P="315"/>to include an amount of Federal funding in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance of the award;</P>
            <P>(4) The non-Federal entity may go to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)) and comment on any information the system contains about the non-Federal entity itself; and</P>
            <P>(5) Agreement officers will consider that non-Federal entity's comments in determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for a future Federal award.</P>
            <P>(d) If the agreement officer enters information into FAPIIS about a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award and subsequently—</P>
            <P>(1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the agreement officer must correct the information in the system within three business days; and</P>

If the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to NASA that some or all of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, agreement officers must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, agreement officers must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.</P>

These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders.</P>

No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.</P>

Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient.

            <P>(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features that unduly restrict competition.</P>

            <P>(ii) Requirements that the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.<PRTPAGE P="317"/>

            <P>(iv) The specific features of “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.</P>
            <P>(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.</P>
            <P>(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.</P>
            <P>(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, historically underutilized small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and minority educational institutions as subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable. Recipients of NASA awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.</P>
            <P>(1) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts.</P>
            <P>(2) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with these businesses and institutions.</P>
            <P>(3) Encourage contracting with consortiums or teams of these businesses and institutions when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.</P>
            <P>(4) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.</P>
            <P>(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting shall not be used.</P>
            <P>(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by 2 CFR part 180, the implementation of Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”</P>
            <P>(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for NASA, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in NASA's implementation of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.</P>
            <P>(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.</P>
            <P>(4) The proposed award over the simplified acquisition threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.</P>
            <P>(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the simplified acquisition threshold.</P>

            <P>(a) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $100,000) shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(b) All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement.

            <P>(c) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the simplified acquisition threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, NASA, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.</P>
            <P>(d) For Construction and facility improvements, except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, NASA may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided NASA has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected.

            <P>(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by NASA.</P>
            <P>(d) NASA shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate record keeping, NASA may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.</P>
            <P>(e) NASA, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of Recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.</P>
            <P>(f) Unless required by statute, NASA shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when NASA can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to NASA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc.,</E> applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">If submitted for negotiation.</E> If the recipient submits to NASA or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to <PRTPAGE P="320"/>form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">If not submitted for negotiation.</E> If the recipient is not required to submit to NASA or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Suspension or termination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Suspension.</E> NASA or the recipient may suspend the cooperative agreement for a mutually agreeable period of time, if an assessment is required to determine whether the agreement should be terminated.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination.</E> (1) A cooperative agreement provides both NASA and the recipient the ability to terminate the Agreement if it is in their best interests to do so, by giving the other party prior written notice. Upon receipt of a notice of termination, the receiving party shall take immediate steps to stop the accrual of any additional obligations, which might require payment.</P>
            <P>(2) NASA may, for example, terminate the Agreement if the recipient is not making anticipated technical progress, if the recipient materially changes the objectives of the agreement, or if appropriated funds are not available to support the program.</P>
            <P>(3) Similarly, the recipient may terminate the agreement if, for example, technical progress is not being made, if the commercial recipient shifts its technical emphasis, or if other technological advances have made the effort obsolete.</P>
            <P>(4) If the cooperative agreement is terminated by either NASA or the recipient and NASA elects to continue the project with a party other than the recipient, the right of the government to use data first produced by either NASA or the recipient in the performance of this agreement is covered by 1274.905(b). See § 1274.208(l)(6) to assure that appropriate language is contained in § 1274.905(b).</P>
            <P>(5) When NASA terminates a Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the Federal award terms and conditions, NASA must report the termination in FAPIIS.</P>
            <P>(6) The information required under paragraph (b) of this section is not to be reported to designated integrity and performance system until the non-Federal entity either—</P>
            <P>(i) Has exhausted its opportunities to object or challenge the decision, see § 200.341 Opportunities to object, hearings and appeals; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the agreement officer that it intends to appeal the decision to terminate.</P>
            <P>(7) If the agreement officer, after entering information into FAPIIS about a termination, subsequently:</P>
            <P>(i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the agreement officer must correct the information in the system within three business days;</P>
            <P>(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the agreement officer is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.</P>

            <P>(8) Agreement officers shall not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the non-Federal entity asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding agency who posted the information that some of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, agreement officers must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, agreement officers must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.<PRTPAGE P="321"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) When a Federal award is terminated or partially terminated, both NASA or the pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity remain responsible for compliance with the closeout and post-closeout requirements and continuing responsibilities.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of termination requirement.</E> If the Federal award is terminated for the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, the notification must state that—</P>
            <P>(1) The termination decision will be reported in FAPIIS, accessible through SAM;</P>
            <P>(2) The information will be available in FAPIIS for a period of five years from the date of the termination, then archived;</P>
            <P>(3) When considering making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period, NASA must consider that information in judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award, when the Federal share of the Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;</P>
            <P>(4) The non-Federal entity may comment on any information that the OMB-designated integrity and performance system contains about the non-Federal entity for future consideration by NASA. The non-Federal entity may submit comments to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently (CPARS).</P>
            <P>(5) Agreement officers will consider non-Federal entity comments when determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for a future Federal award.</P>

              <P>(5) <E T="03">Practical application</E> means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Recipient</E> means:</P>
              <P>(i) The signatory Recipient party or parties or;</P>
              <P>(ii) The Consortium, where a Consortium has been formed for carrying out Recipient responsibilities under this agreement.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Small Business Firm</E> means a domestic small business concern as defined at 15 U.S.C. 632 and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.

              <P>(8) <E T="03">Subject Invention</E> means any invention of a Recipient and/or Government employee conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this Agreement.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Manufactured substantially in the United States</E> means the product must have over 50 percent of its components manufactured in the United States. This requirement is met if the cost to the Recipient of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all components required to make the product. (In making this determination only the product and its components shall be considered.) The cost of each component includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the product and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which determinations have been made in accordance with FAR 25.102(a)(3) and (4) are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic.</P>

Upon application in compliance with 37 CFR Part 404—Licensing of Government Owned Inventions, the Recipient or each Consortium Member (if applicable), shall be granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government acquires title. Each nonexclusive license may extend to subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of the licensee and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the licensee was legally obligated to do so at the time the cooperative agreement was signed.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">NASA Contractor Inventions.</E> In the event NASA contractors are tasked to perform work in support of specified NASA activities under this cooperative agreement and inventions are made by contractor employees, the recipient will normally retain title to its employee inventions in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, 14 CFR Part 1245, and E.O. 12591. In the event the recipient decides not to pursue right to title in any such invention and NASA obtains title to such inventions, NASA will use reasonable efforts to report such inventions and, upon timely request, NASA will use its best efforts to grant the Recipient or designated Consortium Member (if applicable) the first option to acquire either an exclusive or partially exclusive, revocable, royalty-bearing license, upon terms to be subsequently negotiated, for any patent applications and patents covering such inventions, and subject to the license reserved in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. Upon application in compliance with 37 CFR Part 404—Licensing of Government Owned Inventions, the Recipient or each Consortium Member (if applicable), shall be granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government acquires title. Each nonexclusive license may extend to subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of the licensee and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the licensee was legally obligated to do so at the time the cooperative agreement was signed.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Joint NASA and Recipient Inventions.</E> NASA and Recipient agree to use reasonable efforts to identify and report to each other any inventions made jointly between NASA employees (or employees of NASA contractors) and employees of Recipient.</P>
              <P>(i) For other than small business firms and nonprofit organizations the Administrator may agree that the United States will refrain from exercising its undivided interest in a manner inconsistent with Recipient's commercial interest and to cooperate with Recipient in obtaining patent protection on its undivided interest on any waived inventions subject, however, to the condition that Recipient makes its best efforts to bring the invention to the point of practical application at the earliest practicable time. In the event that the Administrator determines that such efforts are not undertaken, the Administrator may void NASA's agreement to refrain from exercising its undivided interest and grant licenses for the practice of the invention so as to further its development. In the event that the Administrator decides to void NASA's agreement to refrain from exercising its undivided interest and grant licenses for this reason, notice shall be given to the Inventions and Contributions Board as to why such action should not be taken. Either alternative will be subject to the applicable license or licenses reserved in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For small business firms and nonprofit organization, NASA may assign or transfer whatever rights it may acquire in a subject invention from its employee to the Recipient as authorized by 35 U.S.C. 202(e).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Minimum rights reserved by the Government.</E> Any license or assignment granted Recipient pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section will be subject to the reservation of the following licenses:</P>
              <P>(i) As to inventions made solely or jointly by NASA employees, the irrevocable, royalty-free right of the Government of the United States to practice and have practiced the invention by or on behalf of the United States; and</P>
              <P>(ii) As to inventions made solely by, or jointly with, employees of NASA contractors, the rights in the Government of the United States as set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, as well as the revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in the contractor as set forth in 14 CFR 1245.108.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Preference for United States manufacture.</E> The Recipient agrees that any products embodying subject inventions or produced through the use of subject inventions shall be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States may be waived by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) with the concurrence of the Associate General Counsel for Intellectual Property upon a showing by the Recipient that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) Work performed by the Recipient under this cooperative agreement is considered undertaken to carry out a public purpose of support and/or stimulation rather than for acquiring property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Government. Accordingly, such work by the Recipient is not considered “by or for the United States” and the Government assumes no liability for infringement by the Recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.</P>

The Recipient's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Recipient is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Recipient was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Recipient's business to which the invention pertains.</P>
              <P>(2) The Recipient's domestic license may be revoked or modified by the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 3, Licensing of NASA Inventions.

Upon request of the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.</P>
              <P>(4) The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Recipient in the clause of paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this section, whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Recipient will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(4) of this section, and in recognition of the contractor's substantial contribution of funds, facilities and/or equipment to the work performed under this cooperative agreement, the Recipient is authorized, subject to the rights of NASA set forth elsewhere in this clause, to:</P>
              <P>(i) Acquire by negotiation and mutual agreement rights to a subcontractor's subject inventions as the Recipient may deem necessary to obtaining and maintaining of such private support; and</P>

              <P>(B) <E T="03">Waiver petition.</E> The subcontractor should be advised that unless it requests a waiver of title pursuant to the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations (14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1), NASA will acquire title to the subject invention (42 U.S.C. 2457, as amended, sec. 305). If a waiver is not requested or granted, the Recipient may request a license from NASA (see licensing of NASA inventions, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 3). A subcontractor requesting a waiver must follow the procedures set forth in the attached clause REQUESTS FOR WAIVER OF RIGHTS—LARGE BUSINESS.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Preference for United States manufacture.</E> The Recipient agrees that any products embodying subject inventions or produced through the use of subject inventions shall be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States may be waived by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) with the concurrence of the Associate General Counsel for Intellectual Property upon a showing by the Recipient that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>

This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Recipient shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</P>
              <P>(3) The Recipient will notify NASA of any decisions not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.</P>

Upon request of the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.</P>
              <P>(4) The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Recipient in the clause under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this section, whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Recipient will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(4) of this section, and in recognition of the contractor's substantial contribution of funds, facilities and/or equipment to the work performed under this cooperative agreement, the Recipient is authorized, subject to the rights of NASA set forth elsewhere in this clause, to—</P>
              <P>(i) Acquire by negotiation and mutual agreement rights to a subcontractor's subject inventions as the Recipient may deem necessary to obtaining and maintaining of such private support; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Request, in the event of inability to reach agreement pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section that NASA invoke exceptional circumstances as necessary pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2) if the prospective subcontractor is a small business firm or organization, or for all other organizations, request that such rights for the Recipient be included as an additional reservation in a waiver granted pursuant to 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1. Any such requests to NASA should be prepared in consideration of the following guidance and submitted to the contract office:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Exceptional circumstances.</E> A request that NASA make an “exceptional circumstances” determination pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2) must state the scope of rights sought by the Recipient pursuant to such determination; identify the proposed subcontractor and the work to be performed under the subcontract; and state the need for the determination.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Waiver petition.</E> The subcontractor should be advised that unless it requests a waiver of title pursuant to the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations (14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1), NASA will acquire title to the subject invention (42 U.S.C. 2457, as amended, sec. 305). If a waiver is not requested or granted, the Recipient may request a license from NASA (see licensing of NASA inventions, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 3). A subcontractor requesting a waiver must follow the procedures set forth in the REQUESTS FOR WAIVER OF RIGHTS—LARGE BUSINESS provision.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.</E> The Recipient agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Recipient or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Recipient, and such other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Recipient also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceeding under-taken by the agency in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the agency agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Recipient.<PRTPAGE P="335"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Preference for United States manufacture.</E> The Recipient agrees that any products embodying subject inventions or produced through the use of subject inventions shall be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States may be waived by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) with the concurrence of the Associate General Counsel for Intellectual Property upon a showing by the Recipient that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">March-in rights.</E> The Recipient agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, NASA has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency to require the Recipient, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Subcontractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request NASA has the right to grant such a license itself if the Federal agency determines that—</P>
              <P>(1) Such action is necessary because the Recipient or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;</P>
              <P>(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or their licensees;</P>
              <P>(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or licensees; or</P>
              <P>(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this section has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Special provisions for Agreements with nonprofit organizations.</E> If the Recipient is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—</P>

              <P>(1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of NASA, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has one of its primary functions the management of inventions; <E T="03">provided,</E> that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Recipient;</P>
              <P>(2) The Recipient will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when NASA deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</P>
              <P>(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Recipient with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and</P>

              <P>(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Recipient determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; <E T="03">provided</E> that the Recipient is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Recipient. However, the Recipient agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Recipient will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Recipient could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Documentation submissions.</E> A copy of all submissions or requests required by this clause, plus a copy of any reports, manuscripts, publications, or similar material bearing on patent matters, shall be sent to the installation Patent Counsel in addition to any other submission requirements in the cooperative agreement. If any reports contain information describing a “subject invention” for which the Recipient has elected or may elect title, NASA will use reasonable efforts to delay public release by NASA or publication by NASA in a NASA technical series, in order for a patent application to be filed, provided that the Recipient identify the information and the “subject invention” to which it relates at the time of submittal. If required by the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application, and a patent number and issue date for any “subject invention” in any country in which the Recipient has applied for patents.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">July 2002</HD>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, waiver of rights to any or all inventions made or that may be made under a NASA agreement, contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a domestic nonprofit organization may be requested at different time periods. Advance waiver of rights to any or all inventions that may be made under a contract or subcontract may be requested prior to the execution of the agreement, contract or subcontract, or within 30 days after execution by the selected Recipient. In addition, waiver of rights to an identified invention made and reported under an agreement, contract or subcontract may be requested, even though a request for an advance waiver was not made or, if made, was not granted.</P>
              <P>(b) Each request for waiver of rights shall be by petition to the Administrator and shall include an identification of the petitioner; place of business and address; if petitioner is represented by counsel, the name, address, and telephone number of the counsel; the signature of the petitioner or authorized representative; and the date of signature. No specific forms need be used, but the request should contain a positive statement that waiver of rights is being requested under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations; a clear indication of whether the request is for an advance waiver or for a waiver of rights for an individual identified invention; whether foreign rights are also requested and, if so, the countries, and a citation of the specific Section or Sections of the regulations under which such rights are requested; and the name, address, and telephone number of the party with whom to communicate when the request is acted upon. Requests for advance waiver of rights should, preferably, be included with the proposal, but in any event in advance of negotiations.</P>
              <P>(c) Petitions for advance waiver, prior to agreement execution, must be submitted to the Agreement Officer. All other petitions will be submitted to the Patent Representative designated in the contract.</P>
              <P>(d) Petitions submitted with proposals selected for negotiation of an agreement will be forwarded by the Contracting or Officer to the installation Patent Counsel for processing and then to the Inventions and Contributions Board. The Board will consider these petitions and where the Board makes the findings to support the waiver, the Board will recommend to the Administrator that waiver be granted, and will notify the petitioner and the Agreement Officer of the Administrator's determination. The Agreement Officer will be informed by the Board whenever there is insufficient time or information or other reasons to permit a decision to be made without unduly delaying the execution of the agreement. In the latter event, the petitioner will be so notified by the Agreement Officer. All other petitions will be processed by installation Patent Counsel and forwarded to the Board. The Board shall notify the petitioner of its action and if waiver is granted, the conditions, reservations, and obligations thereof will be included in the Instrument of Waiver. Whenever the Board notifies a petitioner of a recommendation adverse to, or different from, the waiver requested, the petitioner may request reconsideration under procedures set forth in the Regulations.</P>

              <P>Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to NASA and is a material part of this contract. NASA's safety priority is to protect: The public; astronauts and pilots; the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts); and high-value equipment and property. A major breach of safety by the Recipient entitles the Government to remedies (pending corrective measures by the Recipient) which includes, suspension or termination of the Cooperative Agreement, require removal or change of Recipient's personnel from performing under the Agreement. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the Agreement. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Recipient that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any “willful” or “repeat” violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</P>
              <P>(a) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security by the Recipient entitles the Government to remedies (pending corrective measures by the Recipient) which includes, suspension or termination of the Cooperative Agreement, require removal or change of Recipient's personnel from performing under the Cooperative Agreement. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the Cooperative Agreement. A major breach of security may arise from any of the following: compromise of classified information; illegal technology transfer; workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction; sabotage; compromise or denial of information technology services; damage or loss greater than $250,000 to the Government; or theft.</P>
              <P>(b) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Recipient shall report the breach to the Agreement Officer. If directed by the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Recipient shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted.</P>

              <P>(a) The Recipient shall be responsible for Information Technology security for all systems connected to a NASA network or operated by the Recipient for NASA, regardless of location. This provision is applicable to all or any part of the cooperative agreement that includes information technology resources or services in which the Recipient must have physical or electronic access to NASA's sensitive information contained in unclassified systems that directly support the mission of the Agency. This includes information technology, hardware, software, and the management, operation, maintenance, programming, and system administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications systems. Examples of tasks that require security provisions include:</P>
              <P>(1) Computer control of spacecraft, satellites, or aircraft or their payloads;</P>
              <P>(2) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by NASA with significant replacement cost should the Recipient's copy be corrupted; and</P>
              <P>(3) Access to NASA networks or computers at a level beyond that granted the general public, e.g. bypassing a firewall.</P>

              <P>(b) The Recipient shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this cooperative agreement. The plan shall describe <PRTPAGE P="344"/>those parts of the cooperative agreement to which this provision applies. The Recipient's IT Security Plan shall be compliant with Federal laws that include, but are not limited to, the Computer Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C. 1441 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the Government Information Security Reform Act of 2000. The plan shall meet IT security requirements in accordance with Federal and NASA policies and procedures that include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources;</P>
              <P>(2) NASA Procedures and Guidelines (NPG) 2810.1, Security of Information Technology; and</P>
              <P>(3) Chapter 3 of NPG 1620.1, NASA Security Procedures and Guidelines.</P>
              <P>(c) Within __ days after cooperative agreement award, the Recipient shall submit for NASA approval an IT Security Plan. This plan must be consistent with and further detail the approach contained in the Recipient's proposal that resulted in the award of this cooperative agreement and in compliance with the requirements stated in this provision. The plan, as approved by the Agreement Officer, shall be incorporated into the cooperative agreement as a compliance document.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Recipient personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to systems operated by the Recipient for NASA or interconnected to a NASA network shall be screened at an appropriate level in accordance with NPG 2810.1, Section 4.5; NPG 1620.1, Chapter 3; and paragraph (d)(2) of this provision. Those Recipient personnel with non-privileged access do not require personnel screening. NASA shall provide screening using standard personnel screening National Agency Check (NAC) forms listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this provision, unless Recipient screening in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) is approved. The Recipient shall submit the required forms to the NASA Center Chief of Security (CCS) within fourteen (14) days after cooperative agreement award or assignment of an individual to a position requiring screening. The forms may be obtained from the CCS. At the option of the government, interim access may be granted pending completion of the NAC.</P>
              <P>(2) Guidance for selecting the appropriate level of screening is based on the risk of adverse impact to NASA missions. NASA defines three levels of risk for which screening is required (IT-1 has the highest level of risk):</P>
              <P>(i) IT-1—Individuals having privileged access or limited privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause very serious adverse impact to NASA missions. These systems include, for example, those that can transmit commands directly modifying the behavior of spacecraft, satellites or aircraft.</P>
              <P>(ii) IT-2—Individuals having privileged access or limited privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause serious adverse impact to NASA missions. These systems include, for example, those that can transmit commands directly modifying the behavior of payloads on spacecraft, satellites or aircraft; and those that contain the primary copy of “level 1” data whose cost to replace exceeds one million dollars.</P>
              <P>(iii) IT-3—Individuals having privileged access or limited privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause significant adverse impact to NASA missions. These systems include, for example, those that interconnect with a NASA network in a way that exceeds access by the general public, such as bypassing firewalls; and systems operated by the Recipient for NASA whose function or data has substantial cost to replace, even if these systems are not interconnected with a NASA network.</P>
              <P>(3) Screening for individuals shall employ forms appropriate for the level of risk as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) IT-1: Fingerprint Card (FC) 258 and Standard Form (SF) 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions;</P>
              <P>(ii) IT-2: FC 258 and SF 85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions; and</P>
              <P>(iii) IT-3: NASA Form 531, Name Check, and FC 258.</P>
              <P>(4) The Agreement Officer may allow the Recipient to conduct its own screening of individuals requiring privileged access or limited privileged access provided the Recipient can demonstrate that the procedures used by the Recipient are equivalent to NASA's personnel screening procedures. As used here, equivalent includes a check for criminal history, as would be conducted by NASA, and completion of a questionnaire covering the same information as would be required by NASA.</P>
              <P>(5) Screening of Recipient personnel may be waived by the Agreement Officer for those individuals who have proof of—</P>
              <P>(i) Current or recent national security clearances (within last three years);</P>
              <P>(ii) Screening conducted by NASA within last three years; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Screening conducted by the Recipient, within last three years, that is equivalent to the NASA personnel screening procedures as approved by the Agreement Officer under paragraph (d)(4) of this provision.</P>

              <P>(e) The Recipient shall ensure that its employees, in performance of the cooperative agreement, receive annual IT security training in NASA IT Security policies, procedures, computer ethics, and best practices in accordance with NPG 2810.1, Section 4.3 requirements. The Recipient may use web-based training available from NASA to meet this requirement.<PRTPAGE P="345"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) The Recipient shall afford NASA, including the Office of Inspector General, access to the Recipient's, subcontractors' or subawardees' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and personnel used in performance of the cooperative agreement. Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection, investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of NASA data or to the function of computer systems operated on behalf of NASA, and to preserve evidence of computer crime.</P>
              <P>(g) The Recipient shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts or subagreements that meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to establish procedures to be used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the handling of allegations of research misconduct. Specifically, the procedures contained in this part are designed to result in:</P>
          <P>(1) Findings as to whether research misconduct by a person or institution has occurred in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting results from research activities funded or supported by NASA; and</P>
          <P>(2) Recommendations on appropriate administrative actions that may be undertaken by NASA in response to research misconduct determined to have occurred.</P>

          <P>(b) This part applies to all research wholly or partially funded or supported by NASA. This includes any research conducted by a NASA installation and any research conducted by a public or private entity receiving NASA funds or <PRTPAGE P="350"/>using NASA facilities, equipment or personnel, under a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, Space Act agreement, or other transaction with NASA.</P>
          <P>(c) NASA shall make a determination of research misconduct only after careful inquiry and investigation by an awardee institution, another Federal agency, or NASA, and an adjudication conducted by NASA. NASA shall afford the accused individual or institution a chance to comment on the investigation report and a chance to appeal the decision resulting from the adjudication. In structuring procedures in individual cases, NASA may take into account procedures already followed by other entities investigating the same allegation of research misconduct. Investigation of allegations which, if true, would constitute criminal offenses, are not covered by this part.</P>
          <P>(d) A determination that research misconduct has occurred must be accompanied by recommendations on appropriate administrative actions. However, the administrative actions themselves may be imposed only after further procedures described in applicable Federal acquisition and NASA regulations concerning contracts, cooperative agreements, grants, Space Act agreements, or other transactions, depending on the type of agreement used to fund or support the research in question. Administrative actions involving NASA civil service employees may be imposed only in compliance with all relevant Federal laws and policies.</P>

          <P>(e) Allegations of research misconduct concerning NASA research may be transmitted to NASA in one of the following ways: By mail address to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 300 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20546-0001 via the NASA OIG Hotline at 1-800-424-9183, or cyber hotline at <E T="03">http://oig.nasa.gov/hotline.html.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(f) To the extent permitted by law, the identity of the Complainant, witnesses, or other sources of information who wish to remain anonymous shall be kept confidential. To the extent permitted by law, NASA shall protect the research misconduct inquiry, investigation, adjudication, and appeal records maintained by NASA as exempt from mandatory disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Privacy Act, as amended.</P>

          <SUBJECT>OIG handling of research misconduct matters.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) When an allegation is made to the OIG, rather than to the awardee institution, the OIG shall determine whether the allegation concerns NASA research and whether the allegation, if true, falls within the definition of research misconduct in § 1275.101(a). Investigation of allegations which, if true, would constitute criminal offenses, are not covered by this part. If these criteria are met and the research in question is being conducted by NASA researchers, the OIG shall proceed in accordance with § 1275.104. If the research in question is being conducted at an awardee institution, another Federal agency, or is a collaboration between NASA researchers and co-investigators at either academia or industry, the OIG must refer the allegation that meets the definition of research misconduct to the entities involved and determine whether to—</P>

          <P>(1) Defer its inquiry or investigation pending review of the results of an inquiry or investigation conducted at the awardee institution or at the Federal agency (referred to for purposes of this part as <E T="03">external investigations</E>) determined to be the lead investigative organization for the case; or</P>
          <P>(2) Commence its own inquiry or investigation.</P>
          <P>(b) The OIG must inform the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist of all allegations that meet the definition of research misconduct received by the OIG and of the determinations of the OIG required by § 1275.101. The NASA Office of the Chief Scientist shall notify the NASA Office of the Chief Engineer or the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist when the research is either engineering or technology research.</P>
          <P>(c) The OIG should defer its inquiry or investigation pending review of the results of an external investigation whenever possible. Nevertheless, the OIG retains the right to proceed at any time with a NASA inquiry or investigation. Circumstances in which the OIG may elect not to defer its inquiry or investigation include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
          <P>(1) When the OIG determines that the awardee institution is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this part;</P>

          <P>(2) When the OIG determines that NASA involvement is needed to protect the public interest, including public health and safety;<PRTPAGE P="352"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) When the OIG determines that the allegation involves an awardee institution of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the investigation itself;</P>
          <P>(4) When the OIG determines that a NASA program or project could be jeopardized by the occurrence of research misconduct; or</P>
          <P>(5) When the OIG determines that any of the notifications or information required to be given to the OIG by the awardee institution pursuant to § 1275.103(b) requires NASA to cease its deferral to the awardee institution's procedures and to conduct its own inquiry or investigation.</P>
          <P>(d) A copy of the investigation report, evidentiary record, and final determination resulting from an external investigation must be transmitted to the OIG for review. The OIG shall determine whether to recommend to the NASA Adjudication Official, or to the lead investigative organization in cases that involve multiple institutions, acceptance of the investigation report and final determination in whole or in part. The OIG's decision must be made within 45 days of receipt of the investigation report and evidentiary record. This period of time may be extended by the OIG for good cause. The OIG shall make this decision based on the OIG's assessment of the completeness of the investigation report, and the OIG's assessment of whether the investigating entity followed reasonable procedures, including whether the Respondent had an adequate opportunity to comment on the investigation report and whether these comments were given due consideration. If the OIG decides to recommend acceptance of the results of the external investigation, in whole or in part, the OIG shall transmit a copy of the final determination, the investigation report, and the evidentiary record to the NASA Adjudication Official, and to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist. When the OIG decides not to recommend acceptance, the OIG must initiate its own investigation.</P>
          <P>(e) In the case of an investigation conducted by the OIG, the OIG shall transmit copies of the investigation report, including the Respondent's written comments (if any), the evidentiary record and its recommendations, to the institution, to the NASA Adjudication Official and to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist.</P>
          <P>(f) Upon learning of alleged research misconduct, the OIG shall identify potentially implicated awards or proposals and, when appropriate, shall ensure that program, grant, or contracting officers handling them are informed. Neither a suspicion nor allegation of research misconduct, nor a pending inquiry or investigation, shall normally delay review of proposals. Subject to paragraph (g) of this section, reviewers or panelists shall not be informed of allegations or of ongoing inquiries or investigations in order to avoid influencing reviews. In the event that an application receives a fundable rating or ranking by a review panel, funding can be deferred by the program until the completion of the inquiry or investigation.</P>
          <P>(g) If, during the course of an OIG conducted inquiry or investigation, it appears that immediate administrative action, as described in § 1275.106, is necessary to protect public health or safety, Federal resources or interests, or the interests of those involved in the inquiry or investigation, the OIG shall inform the NASA sponsor for the research and the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Role of awardee institutions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The awardee institutions have the primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct alleged to have occurred in association with their own institutions, although NASA has ultimate oversight authority for NASA research.</P>

          <P>(b) When an allegation of research misconduct related to NASA research is made directly to the OIG and the OIG defers to the awardee institution's inquiry or investigation, or when an allegation of research misconduct related to NASA research is made directly to the awardee institution which commences an inquiry or investigation, the awardee institution is required to:<PRTPAGE P="353"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Notify the OIG if an inquiry supports a formal investigation as soon as this is determined.</P>
          <P>(2) Keep the OIG informed during such an investigation.</P>
          <P>(3) Notify the OIG immediately—</P>
          <P>(i) If public health or safety is at risk;</P>
          <P>(ii) If Federal resources, reputation, or other interests need protecting;</P>
          <P>(iii) If research activities should be suspended;</P>
          <P>(iv) If there is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law;</P>
          <P>(v) If Federal action is needed to protect the interests of those involved in the investigation; or</P>
          <P>(vi) If the research community or the public should be informed.</P>
          <P>(4) Provide the OIG with a copy of the investigation report, including the recommendations made to the awardee institution's adjudication official and the Respondent's written comments (if any), along with a copy of the evidentiary record.</P>
          <P>(5) Provide the OIG with the awardee institution's final determination, including any corrective actions taken or planned.</P>
          <P>(c) If an awardee institution wishes the OIG to defer its own inquiry or investigation, the awardee institution shall complete any inquiry and decide whether an investigation is warranted within 60 days. It should similarly complete any investigation, adjudication, or other procedure necessary to produce a final determination, within an additional 180 days. If completion of the process is delayed, but the awardee institution wishes NASA's deferral of its own procedures to continue, NASA may require submission of periodic status reports.</P>
          <P>(d) Each awardee institution must maintain and effectively communicate to its staff, appropriate policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, including the requirements on when and how to notify NASA.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Conduct of Inquiry by the OIG.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) When an awardee institution or another Federal agency has promptly initiated its own investigation, the OIG may defer its inquiry or investigation until it receives the results of that external investigation. When the OIG does not receive the results within a reasonable time, the OIG shall ordinarily proceed with its own investigation.</P>
          <P>(b) When the OIG decides to initiate a NASA investigation, the OIG must give prompt written notice to the individual or institution to be investigated, unless notice would prejudice the investigation or unless a criminal investigation is underway or under active consideration. If notice is delayed, it must be given as soon as it will no longer prejudice the investigation or contravene requirements of law or Federal law-enforcement policies.</P>
          <P>(c) When alleged misconduct may involve a crime, the OIG shall determine whether any criminal investigation is already pending or projected. If not, the OIG shall determine whether the matter should be referred to the Department of Justice.</P>
          <P>(d) When a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice or another Federal agency is underway or under active consideration, the OIG shall determine what information, if any, may be disclosed to the Respondent or to NASA employees.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Conduct of the OIG investigation of research misconduct.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The OIG shall make every reasonable effort to complete a NASA research misconduct investigation and issue a report within 120 days after initiating the investigation. The OIG may extend this period of time for good cause.</P>
          <P>(b) A NASA investigation may include:</P>
          <P>(1) Review of award files, reports, and other documents readily available at NASA or in the public domain;</P>
          <P>(2) Review of procedures or methods and inspection of laboratory materials, specimens, and records at awardee institutions;</P>
          <P>(3) Interviews with parties or witnesses;</P>
          <P>(4) Review of any documents or other evidence provided by or properly obtainable from parties, witnesses, or other sources;</P>
          <P>(5) Cooperation with other Federal agencies; and</P>
          <P>(6) Opportunity for the Respondent to be heard.</P>
          <P>(c) The OIG may invite outside consultants or experts to participate in a NASA investigation.</P>
          <P>(d) During the course of the investigation, the OIG shall provide a draft of the investigation report to the Respondent, who shall be invited to submit comments. The Respondent must submit any comments within 20 days of receipt of the draft investigation report. This period of time may be extended by the OIG for good cause. Any comments submitted by the Respondent shall receive full consideration before the investigation report is made final.</P>
          <P>(e) At the end of the investigation proceedings, an investigation report must be prepared that shall include recommended findings as to whether research misconduct has occurred. A recommended finding of research misconduct requires that:</P>
          <P>(1) There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community for maintaining the integrity of the research record;</P>
          <P>(2) The research misconduct be committed intentionally, knowingly, or in reckless disregard of accepted practices; and</P>
          <P>(3) The allegation be proven by a preponderance of evidence.</P>
          <P>(f) The investigation report must also be transmitted with the recommendations for administrative action, when recommended findings of research misconduct are made. Section 1275.106 lists possible recommended administrative actions and considerations for use in determining appropriate recommendations.</P>
          <P>(g) NASA OIG may elect to proceed with its administrative investigation processes in lieu of a research misconduct investigation under this part when the allegation is against a civil service employee (an intramural researcher).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1275.106</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Administrative actions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section are possible administrative actions that may be recommended by the investigation report and adopted by the adjudication process. They are not exhaustive, and are in addition to any administrative actions necessary to correct the research record. The administrative actions range from minimal restrictions (Group I Actions) to severe restrictions (Group III Actions), and do not include possible criminal sanctions.</P>
          <P>(1) Group I Actions.</P>
          <P>(i) Send a letter of reprimand to the individual or institution.</P>
          <P>(ii) Require as a condition of an award that for a specified period of time an individual, department, or institution obtain special prior approval of particular activities from NASA.</P>
          <P>(iii) Require for a specified period of time that an institutional official other than those guilty of research misconduct certify the accuracy of reports generated under an award or provide assurance of compliance with particular policies, regulations, guidelines, or special terms and conditions.</P>
          <P>(2) Group II Actions.</P>
          <P>(i) Restrict for a specified period of time designated activities or expenditures under an active award.</P>

          <P>(ii) Require for a specified period of time special reviews of all requests for funding from an affected individual, department, or institution to ensure that steps have been taken to prevent repetition of the research misconduct.<PRTPAGE P="355"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Group III Actions.</P>
          <P>(i) Immediately suspend or terminate an active award.</P>
          <P>(ii) Debar or suspend an individual, department, or institution from participation in NASA programs for a specified period of time.</P>
          <P>(iii) Prohibit participation of an individual as a NASA reviewer, advisor, or consultant for a specified period of time.</P>
          <P>(b) In deciding what actions are appropriate when research misconduct is found, NASA officials should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited to:</P>
          <P>(i) The degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional, or reckless;</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether the misconduct was an isolated event or part of a pattern;</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether the misconduct had a significant impact on the research record, research subjects, or other researchers, institutions, or the public welfare.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Adjudication.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The NASA Adjudication Official must review and evaluate the investigation report and the evidentiary record required to be transmitted pursuant to § 1275.102(d) and (e). The NASA Adjudication Official may initiate further investigations, which may include affording the Respondent another opportunity for comment, before issuing a decision regarding the case. The NASA Adjudication Official may also return the investigation report to the OIG with a request for further fact-finding or analysis.</P>
          <P>(b) Based on a preponderance of the evidence, the NASA Adjudication Official shall issue a decision setting forth the Agency's findings as to whether research misconduct has occurred and recommending appropriate administrative actions that may be undertaken by NASA in response to research misconduct determined to have occurred. The NASA Adjudication Official shall render a decision within 30 days after receiving the investigation report and evidentiary record, or after completion of any further proceedings. The NASA Adjudication Official may extend this period of time for good cause.</P>
          <P>(c) The decision shall be sent to the Respondent, to the Respondent's institution, and, if appropriate, to the Complainant. If the decision confirms the alleged research misconduct, it must include instructions on how to pursue an appeal to the NASA Appeals Official. The decision shall also be transmitted to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist and the OIG.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Respondent may appeal the decision of the NASA Adjudication Official by notifying the NASA Appeals Official in writing of the grounds for appeal within 30 days after Respondent's receipt of the decision. If the decision is not appealed within the 30-day period, the decision becomes the final Agency action insofar as the findings are concerned.</P>
          <P>(b) The NASA Appeals Official shall inform the Respondent of a final determination within 30 days after receiving the appeal. The NASA Appeals Official may extend this period of time for good cause. The final determination may affirm, overturn, or modify the decision of the NASA Adjudication Official and shall constitute the final Agency action insofar as the findings are concerned. The final determination shall also be transmitted to the NASA Office of the Chief Scientist and the OIG.</P>
          <P>(c) Once final Agency action has been taken pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the recommendations for administrative action shall be sent to the relevant NASA components for further proceedings in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</P>

              <P>(1) The borrower is an air carrier for which credit is not reasonably available at the time of the transaction;</P>
              <P>(2) The intended obligation by the borrower is prudently incurred; and</P>
