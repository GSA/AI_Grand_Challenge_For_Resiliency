      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Allocation of funds.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The determination of eligibility of units of general local government to receive entitlement grants, the entitlement amounts, the allocation of appropriated funds to States for use in nonentitlement areas, the reallocation of funds, the allocation of appropriated funds to insular areas, and the allocation of appropriated funds for discretionary grants under the Secretary's Fund shall be governed by the policies and procedures described in sections 106 and 107 of the Act, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) The definitions in § 570.3 shall govern in applying the policies and procedures described in sections 106 and 107 of the Act.</P>
                <P>(c) In determining eligibility for entitlement and in allocating funds under section 106 of the Act for any federal fiscal year, HUD will recognize corporate status and geographical boundaries and the status of metropolitan areas and principal cities effective as of July 1 preceding such federal fiscal year, subject to the following limitations:</P>
                <P>(1) With respect to corporate status as certified by the applicable State and available for processing by the Census Bureau as of such date;</P>
                <P>(2) With respect to boundary changes or annexations, as are used by the Census Bureau in preparing population estimates for all general purpose governmental units and are available for processing by the Census Bureau as of such date, except that any such boundary changes or annexations which result in the population of a unit of general local government reaching or exceeding 50,000 shall be recognized for this purpose whether or not such changes are used by the Census Bureau in preparing such population estimates; and</P>
                <P>(3) With respect to the status of Metropolitan Statistical Areas and principal cities, as officially designated by the Office of Management and Budget as of such date.</P>
                <P>(d) In determining whether a county qualifies as an urban county, and in computing entitlement amounts for urban counties, the demographic values of population, poverty, housing overcrowding, and age of housing of any Indian tribes located within the county shall be excluded. In allocating amounts to States for use in nonentitlement areas, the demographic values of population, poverty, housing overcrowding and age of housing of all Indian tribes located in all nonentitled areas shall be excluded. It is recognized that all such data on Indian tribes are not generally available from the United States Bureau of the Census and that missing portions of data will have to be estimated. In accomplishing any such estimates the Secretary may use such other related information available from reputable sources as may seem appropriate, regardless of the data's point or period of time and shall use the best judgement possible in adjusting such data to reflect the same point or period of time as the overall data from which the Indian tribes are being deducted, so that such deduction shall not create an imbalance with those overall data.</P>
                <P>(e) Amounts remaining after closeout of a grant which are required to be returned to HUD under the provisions of § 570.509, Grant closeout procedures, shall be considered as funds available for reallocation unless the appropriation under which the funds were provided to the Department has lapsed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General policies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility.</E> An activity may be assisted in whole or in part with CDBG funds only if all of the following requirements are met:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Compliance with section 105 of the Act.</E> Each activity must meet the eligibility requirements of section 105 of the Act as further defined in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Compliance with national objectives.</E> Grant recipients under the Entitlement and HUD-administered Small Cities programs and recipients of insular area funds under section 106 of the Act must certify that their projected use of funds has been developed so as to give maximum feasible priority to activities which will carry out one of the national objectives of benefit to low- and moderate-income families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. The projected use of funds may also include activities that the recipient certifies are designed to meet other community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community where other financial resources are not available to meet such needs. Consistent with the foregoing, each recipient under the Entitlement or HUD-administered Small Cities programs, and each recipient of insular area funds under section 106 of the Act must ensure and maintain evidence that each of its activities assisted with CDBG funds meets one of the three national objectives as contained in its certification. Criteria for determining whether an activity addresses one or more of these objectives are found in § 570.208.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance with the primary objective.</E> The primary objective of the Act is described in section 101(c) of the Act. Consistent with this objective, entitlement recipients, non-entitlement CDBG grantees in Hawaii, and recipients of insular area funds under section 106 of the Act must ensure that, over a period of time specified in their certification not to exceed three years, not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of CDBG fund expenditures shall be for activities meeting the criteria under § 570.208(a) or under § 570.208(d)(5) or (6) for benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. For grants under section 107 of the Act, insular area recipients must meet this requirement for each separate grant. See § 570.420(d)(3) for additional discussion of the primary objective requirement for insular areas funded under section 106 of the Act. The requirements for the HUD-administered Small Cities program in New York are at § 570.420(d)(2). In determining the percentage of funds expended for such activities:</P>
                <P>(i) Cost of administration and planning eligible under § 570.205 and § 570.206 will be assumed to benefit low and moderate income persons in the same proportion as the remainder of the CDBG funds and, accordingly shall be excluded from the calculation;</P>
                <P>(ii) Funds deducted by HUD for repayment of urban renewal temporary loans pursuant to § 570.802(b) shall be excluded;</P>
                <P>(iii) Funds expended for the repayment of loans guaranteed under the provisions of subpart M of this part (including repayment of the portion of a loan used to pay any issuance, servicing, underwriting, or other costs as may be incurred under § 570.705(g)) shall also be excluded;</P>

                <P>(iv) Funds expended for the acquisition, new construction or rehabilitation of property for housing that qualifies under § 570.208(a)(3) shall be counted for this purpose but shall be limited to an amount determined by multiplying the total cost (including CDBG and non-CDBG costs) of the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation by the percent of units in such housing to <PRTPAGE P="16"/>be occupied by low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(v) Funds expended for any other activities qualifying under § 570.208(a) shall be counted for this purpose in their entirety.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Compliance with environmental review procedures.</E> The environmental review procedures set forth at 24 CFR part 58 must be completed for each activity (or project as defined in 24 CFR part 58), as applicable.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Cost principles.</E> Costs incurred, whether charged on a direct or an indirect basis, must be in conformance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E. All items of cost listed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, that require prior Federal agency approval are allowable without prior approval of HUD to the extent they comply with the general policies and principles stated in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and are otherwise eligible under this subpart C, except for the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Depreciation methods for fixed assets shall not be changed without the approval of the Federal cognizant agency.</P>
                <P>(ii) Fines penalties, damages, and other settlements are unallowable costs to the CDBG program.</P>
                <P>(iii) Costs of housing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> depreciation, maintenance, utilities, furnishings, rent), housing allowances and personal living expenses (goods or services for personal use) regardless of whether reported as taxable income to the employees (2 CFR 200.445);</P>
                <P>(iv) Organization costs (2 CFR 200.455); and</P>
                <P>(v) Pre-award costs are limited to those authorized under paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Special policies governing facilities.</E> The following special policies apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Facilities containing both eligible and ineligible uses.</E> A public facility otherwise eligible for assistance under the CDBG program may be provided with CDBG funds even if it is part of a multiple use building containing ineligible uses, if:</P>
                <P>(i) The facility which is otherwise eligible and proposed for assistance will occupy a designated and discrete area within the larger facility; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The recipient can determine the costs attributable to the facility proposed for assistance as separate and distinct from the overall costs of the multiple-use building and/or facility.</P>
                <FP>Allowable costs are limited to those attributable to the eligible portion of the building or facility.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Fees for use of facilities.</E> Reasonable fees may be charged for the use of the facilities assisted with CDBG funds, but charges such as excessive membership fees, which will have the effect of precluding low and moderate income persons from using the facilities, are not permitted.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Special assessments under the CDBG program.</E> The following policies relate to special assessments under the CDBG program:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Definition of special assessment.</E> The term “special assessment” means the recovery of the capital costs of a public improvement, such as streets, water or sewer lines, curbs, and gutters, through a fee or charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public improvement, or a one-time charge made as a condition of access to a public improvement. This term does not relate to taxes, or the establishment of the value of real estate for the purpose of levying real estate, property, or ad valorem taxes, and does not include periodic charges based on the use of a public improvement, such as water or sewer user charges, even if such charges include the recovery of all or some portion of the capital costs of the public improvement.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Special assessments to recover capital costs.</E> Where CDBG funds are used to pay all or part of the cost of a public improvement, special assessments may be imposed as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Special assessments to recover the CDBG funds may be made only against properties owned and occupied by persons not of low and moderate income. Such assessments constitute program income.</P>

                <P>(ii) Special assessments to recover the non-CDBG portion may be made provided that CDBG funds are used to pay the special assessment in behalf of all properties owned and occupied by low and moderate income persons; except that CDBG funds need not be used <PRTPAGE P="17"/>to pay the special assessments in behalf of properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons if the grant recipient certifies that it does not have sufficient CDBG funds to pay the assessments in behalf of all of the low and moderate income owner-occupant persons. Funds collected through such special assessments are not program income.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Public improvements not initially assisted with CDBG funds.</E> The payment of special assessments with CDBG funds constitutes CDBG assistance to the public improvement. Therefore, CDBG funds may be used to pay special assessments provided:</P>
                <P>(i) The installation of the public improvements was carried out in compliance with requirements applicable to activities assisted under this part including environmental, citizen participation and Davis-Bacon requirements;</P>
                <P>(ii) The installation of the public improvement meets a criterion for national objectives in § 570.208(a)(1), (b), or (c); and</P>
                <P>(iii) The requirements of § 570.200(c)(2)(ii) are met.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Consultant activities.</E> Consulting services are eligible for assistance under this part for professional assistance in program planning, development of community development objectives, and other general professional guidance relating to program execution. The use of consultants is governed by the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Employer-employee type of relationship.</E> No person providing consultant services in an employer-employee type of relationship shall receive more than a reasonable rate of compensation for personal services paid with CDBG funds. In no event, however, shall such compensation exceed the equivalent of the daily rate paid for Level IV of the Executive Schedule. Such services shall be evidenced by written agreements between the parties which detail the responsibilities, standards, and compensation.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Independent contractor relationship.</E> Consultant services provided under an independent contractor relationship are governed by the procurement requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and are not subject to the compensation limitation of Level IV of the Executive Schedule.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Recipient determinations required as a condition of eligibility.</E> In several instances under this subpart, the eligibility of an activity depends on a special local determination. Recipients shall maintain documentation of all such determinations. A written determination is required for any activity carried out under the authority of §§ 570.201(f), 570.201(i)(2), 570.201(p), 570.201(q), 570.202(b)(3), 570.206(f), 570.209, 570.210, and 570.309.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Means of carrying out eligible activities.</E> (1) Activities eligible under this subpart, other than those authorized under § 570.204(a), may be undertaken, subject to local law:</P>
                <P>(i) By the recipient through:</P>
                <P>(A) Its employees, or</P>
                <P>(B) Procurement contracts governed by the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart D; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Through loans or grants under agreements with subrecipients, as defined at § 570.500(c); or</P>
                <P>(iii) By one or more public agencies, including existing local public agencies, that are designated by the chief executive officer of the recipient.</P>
                <P>(2) Activities made eligible under § 570.204(a) may only be undertaken by entities specified in that section.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Limitation on planning and administrative costs</E>—(1) <E T="03">Origin year grant expenditure test.</E> For origin year 2015 grants and subsequent grants, no more than 20 percent of any origin year grant shall be expended for planning and program administrative costs, as defined in §§ 570.205 and 570.206, respectively. Expenditures of program income for planning and program administrative costs are excluded from this calculation.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Program year obligation test.</E> For all grants and recipients subject to subpart D, the amount of CDBG funds obligated during each program year for planning plus administrative costs, as defined in §§ 570.205 and 570.206, respectively, shall be limited to an amount no greater than 20 percent of the sum of the grant made for that program year (if any) plus the program income received by the recipient and its subrecipients (if any) during that program year. For origin year 2015 grants and <PRTPAGE P="18"/>subsequent grants, recipients must apply this test consistent with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Funds from a grant of any origin year may be used to pay planning and program administrative costs associated with any grant of any origin year.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Reimbursement for pre-award costs.</E> The effective date of the grant agreement is the program year start date or the date that the consolidated plan is received by HUD, whichever is later. For a Section 108 loan guarantee, the effective date of the grant agreement is the date of HUD execution of the grant agreement amendment for the particular loan guarantee commitment.</P>
                <P>(1) Prior to the effective date of the grant agreement, a recipient may incur costs or may authorize a subrecipient to incur costs, and then after the effective date of the grant agreement pay for those costs using its CDBG funds, provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) The activity for which the costs are being incurred is included, prior to the costs being incurred, in a consolidated plan action plan, an amended consolidated plan action plan, or an application under subpart M of this part, except that a new entitlement grantee preparing to receive its first allocation of CDBG funds may incur costs necessary to develop its consolidated plan and undertake other administrative actions necessary to receive its first grant, prior to the costs being included in its consolidated plan;</P>
                <P>(ii) Citizens are advised of the extent to which these pre-award costs will affect future grants;</P>
                <P>(iii) The costs and activities funded are in compliance with the requirements of this part and with the Environmental Review Procedures stated in 24 CFR part 58;</P>
                <P>(iv) The activity for which payment is being made complies with the statutory and regulatory provisions in effect at the time the costs are paid for with CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(v) CDBG payment will be made during a time no longer than the next two program years following the effective date of the grant agreement or amendment in which the activity is first included; and</P>
                <P>(vi) The total amount of pre-award costs to be paid during any program year pursuant to this provision is no more than the greater of 25 percent of the amount of the grant made for that year or $300,000.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may authorize payment of pre-award costs for activities that do not meet the criteria at paragraph (h)(1)(v) or (h)(1)(vi) of this section, if HUD determines, in writing, that there is good cause for granting an exception upon consideration of the following factors, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether granting the authority would result in a significant contribution to the goals and purposes of the CDBG program;</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether failure to grant the authority would result in undue hardship to the recipient or beneficiaries of the activity;</P>
                <P>(iii) Whether granting the authority would not result in a violation of a statutory provision or any other regulatory provision;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether circumstances are clearly beyond the recipient's control; or</P>
                <P>(v) Any other relevant considerations.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Urban Development Action Grant.</E> Grant assistance may be provided with Urban Development Action Grant funds, subject to the provisions of subpart G, for:</P>
                <P>(1) Activities eligible for assistance under this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 570.207, such other activities as the Secretary may determine to be consistent with the purposes of the Urban Development Action Grant program.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Equal participation of faith-based organizations.</E> The HUD program requirements in § 5.109 of this title apply to the CDBG program, including the requirements regarding disposition and change in use of real property by a faith-based organization.</P>

                <P>(k) Any unexpended CDBG origin year grant funds in the United States Treasury account on September 30 of the fifth Federal fiscal year after the end of the origin year grant's period of availability for obligation by HUD will <PRTPAGE P="19"/>be canceled. HUD may require an earlier expenditure and draw down deadline under a grant agreement.</P>

                <P>CDBG funds may be used for the following activities:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition.</E> Acquisition in whole or in part by the recipient, or other public or private nonprofit entity, by purchase, long-term lease, donation, or otherwise, of real property (including air rights, water rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other interests therein) for any public purpose, subject to the limitations of § 570.207.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> Disposition, through sale, lease, donation, or otherwise, of any real property acquired with CDBG funds or its retention for public purposes, including reasonable costs of temporarily managing such property or property acquired under urban renewal, provided that the proceeds from any such disposition shall be program income subject to the requirements set forth in § 570.504.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Public facilities and improvements.</E> Acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or installation of public facilities and improvements, except as provided in § 570.207(a), carried out by the recipient or other public or private nonprofit entities. (However, activities under this paragraph may be directed to the removal of material and architectural barriers that restrict the mobility and accessibility of elderly or severely disabled persons to public facilities and improvements, including those provided for in § 570.207(a)(1).) In undertaking such activities, design features and improvements which promote energy efficiency may be included. Such activities may also include the execution of architectural design features, and similar treatments intended to enhance the aesthetic quality of facilities and improvements receiving CDBG assistance, such as decorative pavements, railings, sculptures, pools of water and fountains, and other works of art. Facilities designed for use in providing shelter for persons having special needs are considered public facilities and not subject to the prohibition of new housing construction described in § 570.207(b)(3). Such facilities include shelters for the homeless; convalescent homes; hospitals, nursing homes; battered spouse shelters; halfway houses for run-away children, drug offenders or parolees; group homes for mentally retarded persons and temporary housing for disaster victims. In certain cases, nonprofit entities and subrecipients including those specified in § 570.204 may acquire title to public facilities.

Public facilities and improvements eligible for assistance under this paragraph are subject to the policies in § 570.200(b).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Clearance and remediation activities.</E> Clearance, demolition, and removal of buildings and improvements, including movement of structures to other sites and remediation of known or suspected environmental contamination.

To be eligible for CDBG assistance, a public service must be either a new service or a quantifiable increase in the level of an existing service above that which has been provided by or on <PRTPAGE P="20"/>behalf of the unit of general local government (through funds raised by the unit or received by the unit from the State in which it is located) in the 12 calendar months before the submission of the action plan. (An exception to this requirement may be made if HUD determines that any decrease in the level of a service was the result of events not within the control of the unit of general local government.)

                <P>(1) The amount of CDBG funds used for public services shall not exceed 15 percent of each grant, except that for entitlement grants made under subpart D of this part, nonentitlement CDBG grants in Hawaii, and for recipients of insular area funds under section 106 of the Act, the amount shall not exceed 15 percent of the grant plus 15 percent of program income, as defined in § 570.500(a). For entitlement grants under subpart D of this part, nonentitlement CDBG grants in Hawaii, and for recipients of insular area funds under section 106 of the Act, compliance is based on limiting the amount of CDBG funds obligated for public service activities in each program year to an amount no greater than 15 percent of the entitlement grant made for that program year plus 15 percent of the program income received during the grantee's immediately preceding program year.</P>
                <P>(2) A recipient which obligated more CDBG funds for public services than 15 percent of its grant funded from origin year 1982 or 1983 appropriations (excluding program income and any assistance received under Public Law 98-8), may obligate more CDBG funds than allowable under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, so long as the total amount obligated in any program year does not exceed:</P>

                <P>(ii) The execution of special garbage, trash, and debris removal, including neighborhood cleanup campaigns, but not the regular curbside collection of garbage or trash in an area.</P>
                <P>(2) In order to alleviate emergency conditions threatening the public health and safety in areas where the chief executive officer of the recipient determines that such an emergency condition exists and requires immediate resolution, CDBG funds may be used for:</P>

                <P>(3) A CBDO that does not qualify under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section may also be determined to qualify as an eligible entity under this section if the recipient demonstrates to the satisfaction of HUD, through the provision of information regarding the organization's charter and by-laws, that the organization is sufficiently similar in purpose, function, and scope to those entities qualifying under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Ineligible activities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The general rule is that any activity that is not authorized under the provisions of §§ 570.201-570.206 is ineligible to be assisted with CDBG funds. This section identifies specific activities that are ineligible and provides guidance in determining the eligibility of other activities frequently associated with housing and community development.</P>
                <P>(a) The following activities may not be assisted with CDBG funds:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Buildings or portions thereof, used for the general conduct of government</E> as defined at § 570.3(d) cannot be assisted <PRTPAGE P="29"/>with CDBG funds. This does not include, however, the removal of architectural barriers under § 570.201(c) involving any such building. Also, where acquisition of real property includes an existing improvement which is to be used in the provision of a building for the general conduct of government, the portion of the acquisition cost attributable to the land is eligible, provided such acquisition meets a national objective described in § 570.208.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">General government expenses.</E> Except as otherwise specifically authorized in this subpart or under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, expenses required to carry out the regular responsibilities of the unit of general local government are not eligible for assistance under this part.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Political activities.</E> CDBG funds shall not be used to finance the use of facilities or equipment for political purposes or to engage in other partisan political activities, such as candidate forums, voter transportation, or voter registration. However, a facility originally assisted with CDBG funds may be used on an incidental basis to hold political meetings, candidate forums, or voter registration campaigns, provided that all parties and organizations have access to the facility on an equal basis, and are assessed equal rent or use charges, if any.</P>
                <P>(b) The following activities may not be assisted with CDBG funds unless authorized under provisions of § 570.203 or as otherwise specifically noted herein or when carried out by an entity under the provisions of § 570.204.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Purchase of equipment.</E> The purchase of equipment with CDBG funds is generally ineligible.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Construction equipment.</E> The purchase of construction equipment is ineligible, but compensation for the use of such equipment through leasing or depreciation pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, as applicable for an otherwise eligible activity is an eligible use of CDBG funds. However, the purchase of construction equipment for use as part of a solid waste disposal facility is eligible under § 570.201(c).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Fire protection equipment.</E> Fire protection equipment is considered for this purpose to be an integral part of a public facility and thus, purchase of such equipment would be eligible under § 570.201(c).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Furnishings and personal property.</E> The purchase of equipment, fixtures, motor vehicles, furnishings, or other personal property not an integral structural fixture is generally ineligible. CDBG funds may be used, however, to purchase or to pay depreciation in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, for such items when necessary for use by a recipient or its subrecipients in the administration of activities assisted with CDBG funds, or when eligible as fire fighting equipment, or when such items constitute all or part of a public service pursuant to § 570.201(e).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating and maintenance expenses.</E> The general rule is that any expense associated with repairing, operating or maintaining public facilities, improvements and services is ineligible. Specific exceptions to this general rule are operating and maintenance expenses associated with public service activities, interim assistance, and office space for program staff employed in carrying out the CDBG program. For example, the use of CDBG funds to pay the allocable costs of operating and maintaining a facility used in providing a public service would be eligible under § 570.201(e), even if no other costs of providing such a service are assisted with such funds. Examples of ineligible operating and maintenance expenses are:</P>
                <P>(i) Maintenance and repair of publicly owned streets, parks, playgrounds, water and sewer facilities, neighborhood facilities, senior centers, centers for persons with a disabilities, parking and other public facilities and improvements. Examples of maintenance and repair activities for which CDBG funds may not be used include the filling of pot holes in streets, repairing of cracks in sidewalks, the mowing of recreational areas, and the replacement of expended street light bulbs; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Payment of salaries for staff, utility costs and similar expenses necessary for the operation of public works and facilities.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">New housing construction.</E> For the purpose of this paragraph, activities in support of the development of low or <PRTPAGE P="30"/>moderate income housing including clearance, site assemblage, provision of site improvements and provision of public improvements and certain housing pre-construction costs set forth in § 570.206(g), are not considered as activities to subsidize or assist new residential construction. CDBG funds may not be used for the construction of new permanent residential structures or for any program to subsidize or assist such new construction, except:</P>
                <P>(i) As provided under the last resort housing provisions set forth in 24 CFR part 42;</P>
                <P>(ii) As authorized under § 570.201(m) or (n);</P>
                <P>(iii) When carried out by an entity pursuant to § 570.204(a);</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Income payments.</E> The general rule is that CDBG funds may not be used for income payments. For purposes of the CDBG program, “income payments” means a series of subsistence-type grant payments made to an individual or family for items such as food, clothing, housing (rent or mortgage), or utilities, but excludes emergency grant payments made over a period of up to three consecutive months to the provider of such items or services on behalf of an individual or family.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for national objectives.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following criteria shall be used to determine whether a CDBG-assisted activity complies with one or more of the national objectives as required under § 570.200(a)(2):</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Activities benefiting low- and moderate-income persons.</E> Activities meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section as applicable, will be considered to benefit low and moderate income persons unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. In assessing any such evidence, the full range of direct effects of the assisted activity will be considered. (The recipient shall appropriately ensure that activities that meet these criteria do not benefit moderate income persons to the exclusion of low income persons.)</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Area benefit activities.</E> (i) An activity, the benefits of which are available to all the residents in a particular area, where at least 51 percent of the residents are low and moderate income persons. Such an area need not be coterminous with census tracts or other officially recognized boundaries but must be the entire area served by the activity. An activity that serves an area that is not primarily residential in character shall not qualify under this criterion.</P>
                <P>(ii) For metropolitan cities and urban counties, an activity that would otherwise qualify under § 570.208(a)(1)(i), except that the area served contains less than 51 percent low- and moderate-income residents, will also be considered to meet the objective of benefiting low- and moderate-income persons where the proportion of such persons in the area is within the highest quartile of all areas in the recipient's jurisdiction in terms of the degree of concentration of such persons. This exception is inapplicable to non-entitlement CDBG grants in Hawaii. In applying this exception, HUD will determine the lowest proportion a recipient may use to qualify an area for this purpose, as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) All census block groups in the recipient's jurisdiction shall be rank ordered from the block group of highest proportion of low and moderate income persons to the block group with the lowest. For urban counties, the rank ordering shall cover the entire area constituting the urban county and shall not be done separately for each participating unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>(B) In any case where the total number of a recipient's block groups does not divide evenly by four, the block group which would be fractionally divided between the highest and second quartiles shall be considered to be part of the highest quartile.</P>

                <P>(C) The proportion of low and moderate income persons in the last census block group in the highest quartile shall be identified. Any service area located within the recipient's jurisdiction and having a proportion of low and moderate income persons at or above this level shall be considered to be within the highest quartile.<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
                </P>
                <P>(D) If block group data are not available for the entire jurisdiction, other data acceptable to the Secretary may be used in the above calculations.</P>
                <P>(iii) An activity to develop, establish, and operate for up to two years after the establishment of, a uniform emergency telephone number system serving an area having less than the percentage of low- and moderate-income residents required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or (as applicable) paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, provided the recipient obtains prior HUD approval. To obtain such approval, the recipient must:</P>
                <P>(A) Demonstrate that the system will contribute significantly to the safety of the residents of the area. The request for approval must include a list of the emergency services that will participate in the emergency telephone number system;</P>
                <P>(B) Submit information that serves as a basis for HUD to determine whether at least 51 percent of the use of the system will be by low- and moderate-income persons. As available, the recipient must provide information that identifies the total number of calls actually received over the preceding 12-month period for each of the emergency services to be covered by the emergency telephone number system and relates those calls to the geographic segment (expressed as nearly as possible in terms of census tracts, block numbering areas, block groups, or combinations thereof that are contained within the segment) of the service area from which the calls were generated. In analyzing this data to meet the requirements of this section, HUD will assume that the distribution of income among the callers generally reflects the income characteristics of the general population residing in the same geographic area where the callers reside. If HUD can conclude that the users have primarily consisted of low- and moderate-income persons, no further submission is needed by the recipient. If a recipient plans to make other submissions for this purpose, it may request that HUD review its planned methodology before expending the effort to acquire the information it expects to use to make its case;</P>
                <P>(C) Demonstrate that other Federal funds received by the recipient are insufficient or unavailable for a uniform emergency telephone number system. For this purpose, the recipient must submit a statement explaining whether the lack of funds is due to the insufficiency of the amount of the available funds, restrictions on the use of such funds, or the prior commitment of funds by the recipient for other purposes; and</P>
                <P>(D) Demonstrate that the percentage of the total costs of the system paid for by CDBG funds does not exceed the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons in the service area of the system. For this purpose, the recipient must include a description of the boundaries of the service area of the emergency telephone number system, the census divisions that fall within the boundaries of the service area (census tracts or block numbering areas), the total number of persons and the total number of low- and moderate-income persons within each census division, the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons within the service area, and the total cost of the system.</P>
                <P>(iv) An activity for which the assistance to a public improvement that provides benefits to all the residents of an area is limited to paying special assessments (as defined in § 570.200(c)) levied against residential properties owned and occupied by persons of low and moderate income.</P>
                <P>(v) For purposes of determining qualification under this criterion, activities of the same type that serve different areas will be considered separately on the basis of their individual service area.</P>

                <P>(vi) In determining whether there is a sufficiently large percentage of low- and moderate-income persons residing in the area served by an activity to qualify under paragraph (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (vii) of this section, the most recently available decennial census information must be used to the fullest extent feasible, together with the section 8 income limits that would have applied at the time the income information was collected by the Census Bureau. Recipients that believe that the census data does not reflect current <PRTPAGE P="32"/>relative income levels in an area, or where census boundaries do not coincide sufficiently well with the service area of an activity, may conduct (or have conducted) a current survey of the residents of the area to determine the percent of such persons that are low and moderate income. HUD will accept information obtained through such surveys, to be used in lieu of the decennial census data, where it determines that the survey was conducted in such a manner that the results meet standards of statistical reliability that are comparable to that of the decennial census data for areas of similar size. Where there is substantial evidence that provides a clear basis to believe that the use of the decennial census data would substantially overstate the proportion of persons residing there that are low and moderate income, HUD may require that the recipient rebut such evidence in order to demonstrate compliance with section 105(c)(2) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(vii) Activities meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section may be considered to qualify under this paragraph, provided that the area covered by the strategy is either a Federally-designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community or primarily residential and contains a percentage of low- and moderate-income residents that is no less than the percentage computed by HUD pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section or 70 percent, whichever is less, but in no event less than 51 percent. Activities meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section may also be considered to qualify under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Limited clientele activities.</E> (i) An activity which benefits a limited clientele, at least 51 percent of whom are low- or moderate-income persons. (The following kinds of activities may not qualify under paragraph (a)(2) of this section: activities, the benefits of which are available to all the residents of an area; activities involving the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of property for housing; or activities where the benefit to low- and moderate-income persons to be considered is the creation or retention of jobs, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.) To qualify under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the activity must meet one of the following tests:</P>
                <P>(A) Benefit a clientele who are generally presumed to be principally low and moderate income persons. Activities that exclusively serve a group of persons in any one or a combination of the following categories may be presumed to benefit persons, 51 percent of whom are low- and moderate-income: abused children, battered spouses, elderly persons, adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled,” homeless persons, illiterate adults, persons living with AIDS, and migrant farm workers; or</P>
                <P>(B) Require information on family size and income so that it is evident that at least 51 percent of the clientele are persons whose family income does not exceed the low and moderate income limit; or</P>
                <P>(C) Have income eligibility requirements which limit the activity exclusively to low and moderate income persons; or</P>
                <P>(D) Be of such nature and be in such location that it may be concluded that the activity's clientele will primarily be low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(ii) An activity that serves to remove material or architectural barriers to the mobility or accessibility of elderly persons or of adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled” will be presumed to qualify under this criterion if it is restricted, to the extent practicable, to the removal of such barriers by assisting:</P>
                <P>(A) The reconstruction of a public facility or improvement, or portion thereof, that does not qualify under paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</P>
                <P>(B) The rehabilitation of a privately owned nonresidential building or improvement that does not qualify under paragraph (a)(1) or (4) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(C) The rehabilitation of the common areas of a residential structure that contains more than one dwelling unit and that does not qualify under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

                <P>(iii) A microenterprise assistance activity carried out in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="33"/>the provisions of § 570.201(o) with respect to those owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises assisted under the activity during each program year who are low- and moderate-income persons. For purposes of this paragraph, persons determined to be low and moderate income may be presumed to continue to qualify as such for up to a three-year period.</P>
                <P>(iv) An activity designed to provide job training and placement and/or other employment support services, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services, in which the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons assisted is less than 51 percent may qualify under this paragraph in the following limited circumstance:</P>
                <P>(A) In such cases where such training or provision of supportive services assists business(es), the only use of CDBG assistance for the project is to provide the job training and/or supportive services; and</P>
                <P>(B) The proportion of the total cost of the project borne by CDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of the total number of persons assisted who are low or moderate income.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Housing activities.</E> An eligible activity carried out for the purpose of providing or improving permanent residential structures which, upon completion, will be occupied by low- and moderate-income households. This would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the acquisition or rehabilitation of property by the recipient, a subrecipient, a developer, an individual homebuyer, or an individual homeowner; conversion of nonresidential structures; and new housing construction. If the structure contains two dwelling units, at least one must be so occupied, and if the structure contains more than two dwelling units, at least 51 percent of the units must be so occupied. Where two or more rental buildings being assisted are or will be located on the same or contiguous properties, and the buildings will be under common ownership and management, the grouped buildings may be considered for this purpose as a single structure. Where housing activities being assisted meet the requirements of paragraph § 570.208 (d)(5)(ii) or (d)(6)(ii) of this section, all such housing may also be considered for this purpose as a single structure. For rental housing, occupancy by low and moderate income households must be at affordable rents to qualify under this criterion. The recipient shall adopt and make public its standards for determining “affordable rents” for this purpose. The following shall also qualify under this criterion:</P>
                <P>(i) When less than 51 percent of the units in a structure will be occupied by low and moderate income households, CDBG assistance may be provided in the following limited circumstances:</P>
                <P>(A) The assistance is for an eligible activity to reduce the development cost of the new construction of a multifamily, non-elderly rental housing project;</P>
                <P>(B) Not less than 20 percent of the units will be occupied by low and moderate income households at affordable rents; and</P>
                <P>(C) The proportion of the total cost of developing the project to be borne by CDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of units in the project that will be occupied by low and moderate income households.</P>
                <P>(ii) When CDBG funds are used to assist rehabilitation eligible under § 570.202(b)(9) or (10) in direct support of the recipient's Rental Rehabilitation program authorized under 24 CFR part 511, such funds shall be considered to benefit low and moderate income persons where not less than 51 percent of the units assisted, or to be assisted, by the recipient's Rental Rehabilitation program overall are for low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(iii) When CDBG funds are used for housing services eligible under § 570.201(k), such funds shall be considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons if the housing units for which the services are provided are HOME-assisted and the requirements at 24 CFR 92.252 or 92.254 are met.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Job creation or retention activities.</E> An activity designed to create or retain permanent jobs where at least 51 percent of the jobs, computed on a full time equivalent basis, involve the employment of low- and moderate-income <PRTPAGE P="34"/>persons. To qualify under this paragraph, the activity must meet the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(i) For an activity that creates jobs, the recipient must document that at least 51 percent of the jobs will be held by, or will be available to, low- and moderate-income persons.</P>
                <P>(ii) For an activity that retains jobs, the recipient must document that the jobs would actually be lost without the CDBG assistance and that either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to at least 51 percent of the jobs at the time the CDBG assistance is provided:</P>
                <P>(A) The job is known to be held by a low- or moderate-income person; or</P>
                <P>(B) The job can reasonably be expected to turn over within the following two years and that steps will be taken to ensure that it will be filled by, or made available to, a low- or moderate-income person upon turnover.</P>
                <P>(iii) Jobs that are not held or filled by a low- or moderate-income person may be considered to be available to low- and moderate-income persons for these purposes only if:</P>
                <P>(A) Special skills that can only be acquired with substantial training or work experience or education beyond high school are not a prerequisite to fill such jobs, or the business agrees to hire unqualified persons and provide training; and</P>
                <P>(B) The recipient and the assisted business take actions to ensure that low- and moderate-income persons receive first consideration for filling such jobs.</P>
                <P>(iv) For purposes of determining whether a job is held by or made available to a low- or moderate-income person, the person may be presumed to be a low- or moderate-income person if:</P>
                <P>(A) He/she resides within a census tract (or block numbering area) that either:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income persons; or</P>
                <P>(B) The assisted business is located within a census tract (or block numbering area) that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section and the job under consideration is to be located within that census tract.</P>

                <P>(v) A census tract (or block numbering area) qualifies for the presumptions permitted under paragraphs (a)(4)(iv)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (B) of this section if it is either part of a Federally-designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community or meets the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(A) It has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as determined by the most recently available decennial census information;</P>
                <P>(B) It does not include any portion of a central business district, as this term is used in the most recent Census of Retail Trade, unless the tract has a poverty rate of at least 30 percent as determined by the most recently available decennial census information; and</P>
                <P>(C) It evidences pervasive poverty and general distress by meeting at least one of the following standards:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) All block groups in the census tract have poverty rates of at least 20 percent;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The specific activity being undertaken is located in a block group that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD determines that the census tract exhibits other objectively determinable signs of general distress such as high incidence of crime, narcotics use, homelessness, abandoned housing, and deteriorated infrastructure or substantial population decline.</P>
                <P>(vi) As a general rule, each assisted business shall be considered to be a separate activity for purposes of determining whether the activity qualifies under this paragraph, except:</P>
                <P>(A) In certain cases such as where CDBG funds are used to acquire, develop or improve a real property (e.g., a business incubator or an industrial park) the requirement may be met by measuring jobs in the aggregate for all the businesses which locate on the property, provided such businesses are not otherwise assisted by CDBG funds.</P>

                <P>(B) Where CDBG funds are used to pay for the staff and overhead costs of an entity making loans to businesses exclusively from non-CDBG funds, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created by all of the <PRTPAGE P="35"/>businesses receiving loans during each program year.</P>
                <P>(C) Where CDBG funds are used by a recipient or subrecipient to provide technical assistance to businesses, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all of the businesses receiving technical assistance during each program year.</P>
                <P>(D) Where CDBG funds are used for activities meeting the criteria listed at § 570.209(b)(2)(v), this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all businesses for which CDBG assistance is obligated for such activities during the program year, except as provided at paragraph (d)(7) of this section.</P>
                <P>(E) Where CDBG funds are used by a Community Development Financial Institution to carry out activities for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all businesses for which CDBG assistance is obligated for such activities during the program year, except as provided at paragraph (d)(7) of this section.</P>
                <P>(F) Where CDBG funds are used for public facilities or improvements which will result in the creation or retention of jobs by more than one business, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all such businesses as a result of the public facility or improvement.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Where the public facility or improvement is undertaken principally for the benefit of one or more particular businesses, but where other businesses might also benefit from the assisted activity, the requirement may be met by aggregating only the jobs created or retained by those businesses for which the facility/improvement is principally undertaken, provided that the cost (in CDBG funds) for the facility/improvement is less than $10,000 per permanent full-time equivalent job to be created or retained by those businesses.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In any case where the cost per job to be created or retained (as determined under paragraph (a)(4)(vi)(F)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section) is $10,000 or more, the requirement must be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained as a result of the public facility or improvement by all businesses in the service area of the facility/improvement. This aggregation must include businesses which, as a result of the public facility/improvement, locate or expand in the service area of the facility/improvement between the date the recipient identifies the activity in its action plan under part 91 of this title and the date one year after the physical completion of the facility/improvement. In addition, the assisted activity must comply with the public benefit standards at § 570.209(b).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Activities which aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight.</E> Activities meeting one or more of the following criteria, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, will be considered to aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Activities to address slums or blight on an area basis.</E> An activity will be considered to address prevention or elimination of slums or blight in an area if:</P>
                <P>(i) The area, delineated by the recipient, meets a definition of a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area under State or local law;</P>
                <P>(ii) The area also meets the conditions in either paragraph (A) or (B):</P>
                <P>(A) At least 25 percent of properties throughout the area experience one or more of the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Physical deterioration of buildings or improvements;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Abandonment of properties;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Chronic high occupancy turnover rates or chronic high vacancy rates in commercial or industrial buildings;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Significant declines in property values or abnormally low property values relative to other areas in the community; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Known or suspected environmental contamination.</P>
                <P>(B) The public improvements throughout the area are in a general state of deterioration.</P>

                <P>(iii) Documentation is to be maintained by the recipient on the boundaries of the area and the conditions and standards used that qualified the area at the time of its designation. The recipient shall establish definitions of the conditions listed at <PRTPAGE P="36"/>§ 570.208(b)(1)(ii)(A), and maintain records to substantiate how the area met the slums or blighted criteria. The designation of an area as slum or blighted under this section is required to be redetermined every 10 years for continued qualification. Documentation must be retained pursuant to the recordkeeping requirements contained at § 570.506 (b)(8)(ii).</P>
                <P>(iv) The assisted activity addresses one or more of the conditions which contributed to the deterioration of the area. Rehabilitation of residential buildings carried out in an area meeting the above requirements will be considered to address the area's deterioration only where each such building rehabilitated is considered substandard under local definition before rehabilitation, and all deficiencies making a building substandard have been eliminated if less critical work on the building is undertaken. At a minimum, the local definition for this purpose must be such that buildings that it would render substandard would also fail to meet the housing quality standards for the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program-Existing Housing (24 CFR 882.109).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Activities to address slums or blight on a spot basis.</E> The following activities may be undertaken on a spot basis to eliminate specific conditions of blight, physical decay, or environmental contamination that are not located in a slum or blighted area: acquisition; clearance; relocation; historic preservation; remediation of environmentally contaminated properties; or rehabilitation of buildings or improvements. However, rehabilitation must be limited to eliminating those conditions that are detrimental to public health and safety. If acquisition or relocation is undertaken, it must be a precursor to another eligible activity (funded with CDBG or other resources) that directly eliminates the specific conditions of blight or physical decay, or environmental contamination.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Activities to address slums or blight in an urban renewal area.</E> An activity will be considered to address prevention or elimination of slums or blight in an urban renewal area if the activity is:</P>
                <P>(i) Located within an urban renewal project area or Neighborhood Development Program (NDP) action area; i.e., an area in which funded activities were authorized under an urban renewal Loan and Grant Agreement or an annual NDP Funding Agreement, pursuant to title I of the Housing Act of 1949; and</P>

                <P>(ii) Necessary to complete the urban renewal plan, as then in effect, including <E T="03">initial</E> land redevelopment permitted by the plan.</P>
                <NOTE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                  <P>Despite the restrictions in (b) (1) and (2) of this section, any rehabilitation activity which benefits low and moderate income persons pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section can be undertaken without regard to the area in which it is located or the extent or nature of rehabilitation assisted.</P>
                </NOTE>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Activities designed to meet community development needs having a particular urgency.</E> In the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, an activity will be considered to address this objective if the recipient certifies that the activity is designed to alleviate existing conditions which pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community which are of recent origin or which recently became urgent, that the recipient is unable to finance the activity on its own, and that other sources of funding are not available. A condition will generally be considered to be of recent origin if it developed or became critical within 18 months preceding the certification by the recipient.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional criteria.</E> (1) Where the assisted activity is acquisition of real property, a preliminary determination of whether the activity addresses a national objective may be based on the planned use of the property after acquisition. A final determination shall be based on the actual use of the property, excluding any short-term, temporary use. Where the acquisition is for the purpose of clearance which will eliminate specific conditions of blight or physical decay, the clearance activity shall be considered the actual use of the property. However, any subsequent use or disposition of the cleared property shall be treated as a “change of use” under § 570.505.</P>

                <P>(2) Where the assisted activity is relocation assistance that the recipient is required to provide, such relocation <PRTPAGE P="37"/>assistance shall be considered to address the same national objective as is addressed by the displacing activity. Where the relocation assistance is voluntary on the part of the grantee the recipient may qualify the assistance either on the basis of the national objective addressed by the displacing activity or on the basis that the recipients of the relocation assistance are low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(3) In any case where the activity undertaken for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs is a public improvement and the area served is primarily residential, the activity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section as well as those of paragraph (a)(4) of this section in order to qualify as benefiting low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(4) CDBG funds expended for planning and administrative costs under § 570.205 and § 570.206 will be considered to address the national objectives.</P>
                <P>(5) Where the grantee has elected to prepare an area revitalization strategy pursuant to the authority of § 91.215(e) of this title and HUD has approved the strategy, the grantee may also elect the following options:</P>
                <P>(i) Activities undertaken pursuant to the strategy for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs may, at the option of the grantee, be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph under the criteria at paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section in lieu of the criteria at paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(ii) All housing activities in the area for which, pursuant to the strategy, CDBG assistance is obligated during the program year may be considered to be a single structure for purposes of applying the criteria at paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) Where CDBG-assisted activities are carried out by a Community Development Financial Institution whose charter limits its investment area to a primarily residential area consisting of at least 51 percent low- and moderate-income persons, the grantee may also elect the following options:</P>
                <P>(i) Activities carried out by the Community Development Financial Institution for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs may, at the option of the grantee, be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph under the criteria at paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section in lieu of the criteria at paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(ii) All housing activities for which the Community Development Financial Institution obligates CDBG assistance during the program year may be considered to be a single structure for purposes of applying the criteria at paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(7) Where an activity meeting the criteria at § 570.209(b)(2)(v) may also meet the requirements of either paragraph (d)(5)(i) or (d)(6)(i) of this section, the grantee may elect to qualify the activity under either the area benefit criteria at paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section or the job aggregation criteria at paragraph (a)(4)(vi)(D) of this section, but not both. Where an activity may meet the job aggregation criteria at both paragraphs (a)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of this section, the grantee may elect to qualify the activity under either criterion, but not both.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Guidelines for evaluating and selecting economic development projects.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The following guidelines are provided to assist the recipient to evaluate and select activities to be carried out for economic development purposes. Specifically, these guidelines are applicable to activities that are eligible for CDBG assistance under § 570.203. These guidelines also apply to activities carried out under the authority of § 570.204 that would otherwise be eligible under § 570.203, were it not for the involvement of a Community-Based Development Organization (CBDO). (This would include activities where a CBDO makes loans to for-profit businesses.) These guidelines are composed of two components: guidelines for evaluating project costs and financial requirements; and standards for evaluating public benefit. The standards for evaluating public benefit are <E T="03">mandatory,</E> but the guidelines for evaluating projects costs and financial requirements are not.<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
                </P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidelines and objectives for evaluating project costs and financial requirements.</E> HUD has developed guidelines that are designed to provide the recipient with a framework for financially underwriting and selecting CDBG-assisted economic development projects which are financially viable and will make the most effective use of the CDBG funds. These guidelines, also referred to as the underwriting guidelines, are published as appendix A to this part. The use of the underwriting guidelines published by HUD is not mandatory. However, grantees electing not to use these guidelines would be expected to conduct basic financial underwriting prior to the provision of CDBG financial assistance to a for-profit business. Where appropriate, HUD's underwriting guidelines recognize that different levels of review are appropriate to take into account differences in the size and scope of a proposed project, and in the case of a microenterprise or other small business to take into account the differences in the capacity and level of sophistication among businesses of differing sizes. Recipients are encouraged, when they develop their own programs and underwriting criteria, to also take these factors into account. The objectives of the underwriting guidelines are to ensure:</P>
                <P>(1) That project costs are reasonable;</P>
                <P>(2) That all sources of project financing are committed;</P>
                <P>(3) That to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are not substituted for non-Federal financial support;</P>
                <P>(4) That the project is financially feasible;</P>
                <P>(5) That to the extent practicable, the return on the owner's equity investment will not be unreasonably high; and</P>
                <P>(6) That to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are disbursed on a pro rata basis with other finances provided to the project.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards for evaluating public benefit.</E> The grantee is responsible for making sure that at least a minimum level of public benefit is obtained from the expenditure of CDBG funds under the categories of eligibility governed by these guidelines. The standards set forth below identify the types of public benefit that will be recognized for this purpose and the minimum level of each that must be obtained for the amount of CDBG funds used. Unlike the guidelines for project costs and financial requirements covered under paragraph (a) of this section, the use of the standards for public benefit is mandatory. Certain public facilities and improvements eligible under § 570.201(c) of the regulations, which are undertaken for economic development purposes, are also subject to these standards, as specified in § 570.208(a)(4)(vi)(F)(<E T="03">2</E>).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Standards for activities in the aggregate.</E> Activities covered by these guidelines must, in the aggregate, either:</P>
                <P>(i) Create or retain at least one full-time equivalent, permanent job per $35,000 of CDBG funds used; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Provide goods or services to residents of an area, such that the number of low- and moderate-income persons residing in the areas served by the assisted businesses amounts to at least one low- and moderate-income person per $350 of CDBG funds used.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Applying the aggregate standards.</E> (i) A metropolitan city, an urban county, a non-entitlement CDBG grantee in Hawaii, or an Insular Area shall apply the aggregate standards under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to all applicable activities for which CDBG funds are first obligated within each single CDBG program year, without regard to the source year of the funds used for the activities. For Insular Areas, the preceding sentence applies to grants received in program years after Fiscal Year 2004. A grantee under the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, or Insular Areas CDBG grants prior to Fiscal Year 2005, shall apply the aggregate standards under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to all funds obligated for applicable activities from a given grant; program income obligated for applicable activities will, for these purposes, be aggregated with the most recent open grant. For any time period in which a community has no open HUD-administered or Insular Areas grants, the aggregate standards shall be applied to all applicable activities for which program income is obligated during that period.</P>

                <P>(ii) The grantee shall apply the aggregate standards to the number of jobs to be created/retained, or to the <PRTPAGE P="39"/>number of persons residing in the area served (as applicable), as determined at the time funds are obligated to activities.</P>
                <P>(iii) Where an activity is expected both to create or retain jobs and to provide goods or services to residents of an area, the grantee may elect to count the activity under either the jobs standard or the area residents standard, but not both.</P>
                <P>(iv) Where CDBG assistance for an activity is limited to job training and placement and/or other employment support services, the jobs assisted with CDBG funds shall be considered to be created or retained jobs for the purposes of applying the aggregate standards.</P>
                <P>(v) Any activity subject to these guidelines which meets one or more of the following criteria may, at the grantee's option, be excluded from the aggregate standards described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</P>
                <P>(A) Provides jobs exclusively for unemployed persons or participants in one or more of the following programs:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA);</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Jobs Opportunities for Basic Skills (JOBS); or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC);</P>
                <P>(B) Provides jobs predominantly for residents of Public and Indian Housing units;</P>
                <P>(C) Provides jobs predominantly for homeless persons;</P>
                <P>(D) Provides jobs predominantly for low-skilled, low- and moderate-income persons, where the business agrees to provide clear opportunities for promotion and economic advancement, such as through the provision of training;</P>
                <P>(E) Provides jobs predominantly for persons residing within a census tract (or block numbering area) that has at least 20 percent of its residents who are in poverty;</P>
                <P>(F) Provides assistance to business(es) that operate(s) within a census tract (or block numbering area) that has at least 20 percent of its residents who are in poverty;</P>
                <P>(G) Stabilizes or revitalizes a neighborhood that has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income;</P>
                <P>(H) Provides assistance to a Community Development Financial Institution that serve an area that is predominantly low- and moderate-income persons;</P>
                <P>(I) Provides assistance to a Community-Based Development Organization serving a neighborhood that has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income;</P>
                <P>(J) Provides employment opportunities that are an integral component of a project designed to promote spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income and minority persons;</P>
                <P>(K) With prior HUD approval, provides substantial benefit to low-income persons through other innovative approaches;</P>
                <P>(L) Provides services to the residents of an area pursuant to a strategy approved by HUD under the provisions of § 91.215(e) of this title;</P>
                <P>(M) Creates or retains jobs through businesses assisted in an area pursuant to a strategy approved by HUD under the provisions of § 91.215(e) of this title.</P>
                <P>(N) Directly involves the economic development or redevelopment of environmentally contaminated properties.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Standards for individual activities.</E> Any activity subject to these guidelines which falls into one or more of the following categories will be considered by HUD to provide insufficient public benefit, and therefore may under no circumstances be assisted with CDBG funds:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount of CDBG assistance exceeds either of the following, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(A) $50,000 per full-time equivalent, permanent job created or retained; or</P>
                <P>(B) $1,000 per low- and moderate-income person to which goods or services are provided by the activity.</P>
                <P>(ii) The activity consists of or includes any of the following:</P>
                <P>(A) General promotion of the community as a whole (as opposed to the promotion of specific areas and programs);</P>
                <P>(B) Assistance to professional sports teams;</P>

                <P>(C) Assistance to privately-owned recreational facilities that serve a predominantly higher-income clientele, where the recreational benefit to users <PRTPAGE P="40"/>or members clearly outweighs employment or other benefits to low- and moderate-income persons;</P>
                <P>(D) Acquisition of land for which the specific proposed use has not yet been identified; and</P>
                <P>(E) Assistance to a for-profit business while that business or any other business owned by the same person(s) or entity(ies) is the subject of unresolved findings of noncompliance relating to previous CDBG assistance provided by the recipient.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Applying the individual activity standards.</E> (i) Where an activity is expected both to create or retain jobs and to provide goods or services to residents of an area, it will be disqualified only if the amount of CDBG assistance exceeds both of the amounts in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) The individual activity standards in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be applied to the number of jobs to be created or retained, or to the number of persons residing in the area served (as applicable), as determined at the time funds are obligated to activities.</P>
                <P>(iii) Where CDBG assistance for an activity is limited to job training and placement and/or other employment support services, the jobs assisted with CDBG funds shall be considered to be created or retained jobs for the purposes of applying the individual activity standards in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendments to economic development projects after review determinations.</E> If, after the grantee enters into a contract to provide assistance to a project, the scope or financial elements of the project change to the extent that a significant contract amendment is appropriate, the project should be reevaluated under these and the recipient's guidelines. (This would include, for example, situations where the business requests a change in the amount or terms of assistance being provided, or an extension to the loan payment period required in the contract.) If a reevaluation of the project indicates that the financial elements and public benefit to be derived have also substantially changed, then the recipient should make appropriate adjustments in the amount, type, terms or conditions of CDBG assistance which has been offered, to reflect the impact of the substantial change. (For example, if a change in the project elements results in a substantial reduction of the total project costs, it may be appropriate for the recipient to reduce the amount of total CDBG assistance.) If the amount of CDBG assistance provided to the project is increased, the amended project must still comply with the public benefit standards under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The grantee must maintain sufficient records to demonstrate the level of public benefit, based on the above standards, that is actually achieved upon completion of the CDBG-assisted economic development activity(ies) and how that compares to the level of such benefit anticipated when the CDBG assistance was obligated. If the grantee's actual results show a pattern of substantial variation from anticipated results, the grantee is expected to take all actions reasonably within its control to improve the accuracy of its projections. If the actual results demonstrate that the recipient has failed the public benefit standards, HUD may require the recipient to meet more stringent standards in future years as appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Prohibition on use of assistance for employment relocation activities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> CDBG funds may not be used to directly assist a business, including a business expansion, in the relocation of a plant, facility, or operation from one LMA to another LMA if the relocation is likely to result in a significant loss of jobs in the LMA from which the relocation occurs.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this section:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Directly assist.</E> Directly assist means the provision of CDBG funds for activities pursuant to:</P>
                <P>(i) § 570.203(b); or</P>

                <P>(ii) §§ 570.201(a)-(d), 570.201(l), 570.203(a), or § 570.204 when the grantee, <PRTPAGE P="41"/>subrecipient, or, in the case of an activity carried out pursuant to § 570.204, a Community Based Development Organization (CDBO) enters into an agreement with a business to undertake one or more of these activities as a condition of the business relocating a facility, plant, or operation to the grantee's LMA. Provision of public facilities and indirect assistance that will provide benefit to multiple businesses does not fall under the definition of “directly assist,” unless it includes the provision of infrastructure to aid a specific business that is the subject of an agreement with the specific assisted business.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Labor market area (LMA).</E> For metropolitan areas, an LMA is an area defined as such by the BLS. An LMA is an economically integrated geographic area within which individuals can live and find employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change employment without changing their place of residence. In addition, LMAs are nonoverlapping and geographically exhaustive. For metropolitan areas, grantees must use employment data, as defined by the BLS, for the LMA in which the affected business is currently located and from which current jobs may be lost. For non-metropolitan areas, an LMA is either an area defined by the BLS as an LMA, or a state may choose to combine non-metropolitan LMAs. States are required to define or reaffirm prior definitions of their LMAs on an annual basis and retain records to substantiate such areas prior to any business relocation that would be impacted by this rule. Metropolitan LMAs cannot be combined, nor can a non-metropolitan LMA be combined with a metropolitan LMA. For the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, each of the three participating counties in Hawaii will be considered to be its own LMA. Recipients of Fiscal Year 1999 Small Cities Program funding in New York will follow the requirements for State CDBG recipients.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Operation.</E> A business operation includes, but is not limited to, any equipment, employment opportunity, production capacity or product line of the business.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Significant loss of jobs.</E> (i) A loss of jobs is significant if: The number of jobs to be lost in the LMA in which the affected business is currently located is equal to or greater than one-tenth of one percent of the total number of persons in the labor force of that LMA; or in all cases, a loss of 500 or more jobs. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, a loss of 25 jobs or fewer does not constitute a significant loss of jobs.</P>
                <P>(ii) A job is considered to be lost due to the provision of CDBG assistance if the job is relocated within three years of the provision of assistance to the business; or the time period within which jobs are to be created as specified by the agreement between the business and the recipient if it is longer than three years.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Written agreement.</E> Before directly assisting a business with CDBG funds, the recipient, subrecipient, or a CDBO (in the case of an activity carried out pursuant to § 570.204) shall sign a written agreement with the assisted business. The written agreement shall include:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Statement.</E> A statement from the assisted business as to whether the assisted activity will result in the relocation of any industrial or commercial plant, facility, or operation from one LMA to another, and, if so, the number of jobs that will be relocated from each LMA;</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Required information.</E> If the assistance will not result in a relocation covered by this section, a certification from the assisted business that neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries, has plans to relocate jobs at the time the agreement is signed that would result in a significant job loss as defined in this rule; and</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Reimbursement of assistance.</E> The agreement shall provide for reimbursement of any assistance provided to, or expended on behalf of, the business in the event that assistance results in a relocation prohibited under this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Assistance not covered by this section.</E> This section does not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Relocation assistance.</E> Relocation assistance required by the Uniform Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655);<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Microenterprises.</E> Assistance to microenterprises as defined by Section 102(a)(22) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974; and</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Arms-length transactions.</E> Assistance to a business that purchases business equipment, inventory, or other physical assets in an arms-length transaction, including the assets of an existing business, provided that the purchase does not result in the relocation of the sellers' business operation (including customer base or list, goodwill, product lines, or trade names) from one LMA to another LMA and does not produce a significant loss of jobs in the LMA from which the relocation occurs.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Activity locations and float-funding.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The consolidated plan, action plan, and amendment submission requirements referred to in this section are those in 24 CFR part 91.</P>
                <P>(a) For activities for which the grantee has not yet decided on a specific location, such as when the grantee is allocating an amount of funds to be used for making loans or grants to businesses or for residential rehabilitation, the description in the action plan or any amendment shall identify who may apply for the assistance, the process by which the grantee expects to select who will receive the assistance (including selection criteria), and how much and under what terms the assistance will be provided, or in the case of a planned public facility or improvement, how it expects to determine its location.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Float-funded activities and guarantees.</E> A recipient may use undisbursed funds in the line of credit and its CDBG program account that are budgeted in statements or action plans for one or more other activities that do not need the funds immediately, subject to the limitations described below. Such funds shall be referred to as the “float” for purposes of this section and the action plan. Each activity carried out using the float must meet all of the same requirements that apply to CDBG-assisted activities generally, and must be expected to produce program income in an amount at least equal to the amount of the float so used. Whenever the recipient proposes to fund an activity with the float, it must include the activity in its action plan or amend the action plan for the current program year. For purposes of this section, an activity that uses such funds will be called a “float-funded activity.”</P>
                <P>(1) Each float-funded activity must be individually listed and described as such in the action plan.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) The expected time period between obligation of assistance for a float-funded activity and receipt of program income in an amount at least equal to the full amount drawn from the float to fund the activity may not exceed 2.5 years. An activity from which program income sufficient to recover the full amount of the float assistance is expected to be generated more than 2.5 years after obligation may not be funded from the float, but may be included in an action plan if it is funded from CDBG funds other than the float (e.g., grant funds or proceeds from an approved Section 108 loan guarantee).</P>

                <P>(ii) Any extension of the repayment period for a float-funded activity shall be considered to be a new float-funded activity for these purposes and may be implemented by the grantee only if the extension is made subject to the same limitations and requirements as apply to a new float-funded activity.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) Unlike other projected program income, the full amount of income expected to be generated by a float-funded activity must be shown as a source of program income in the action plan containing the activity, whether or not some or all of the income is expected to be received in a future program year (in accordance with 24 CFR 91.220(g)(1)(ii)(D)).</P>
                <P>(4) The recipient must also clearly declare in the action plan that identifies the float-funded activity the recipient's commitment to undertake one of the following options:</P>
                <P>(i) Amend or delete activities in an amount equal to any default or failure to produce sufficient income in a timely manner. If the recipient makes this choice, it must include a description of the process it will use to select the activities to be amended or deleted and how it will involve citizens in that process; and it must amend the applicable statement(s) or action plan(s) showing those amendments or deletions promptly upon determining that the float-funded activity will not generate sufficient or timely program income;</P>
                <P>(ii) Obtain an irrevocable line of credit from a commercial lender for the full amount of the float-funded activity and describe the lender and terms of such line of credit in the action plan that identifies the float-funded activity. To qualify for this purpose, such line of credit must be unconditionally available to the recipient in the amount of any shortfall within 30 days of the date that the float-funded activity fails to generate the projected amount of program income on schedule;</P>
                <P>(iii) Transfer general local government funds in the full amount of any default or shortfall to the CDBG line of credit within 30 days of the float-funded activity's failure to generate the projected amount of the program income on schedule; or</P>
                <P>(iv) A method approved in writing by HUD for securing timely return of the amount of the float funding. Such method must ensure that funds are available to meet any default or shortfall within 30 days of the float-funded activity's failure to generate the projected amount of the program income on schedule.</P>
                <P>(5) When preparing an action plan for a year in which program income is expected to be received from a float-funded activity, and such program income has been shown in a prior statement or action plan, the current action plan shall identify the expected income and explain that the planned use of the income has already been described in prior statements or action plans, and shall identify the statements or action plans in which such descriptions may be found.</P>

The certifications will be satisfactory to the Secretary for this purpose unless the Secretary has determined pursuant to subpart O of this part that the grantee has not complied with the requirements of this part, has failed to carry out its consolidated plan as provided under § 570.903, or has determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the grantee's past performance <PRTPAGE P="44"/>under this program, that tends to challenge in a substantial manner the grantee's certification of future performance.

                <SUBJECT>Urban counties.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination of qualification.</E> The Secretary will determine the qualifications of counties to receive entitlements as urban counties upon receipt of qualification documentation from counties at such time, and in such manner and form as prescribed by HUD. The Secretary shall determine eligibility and applicable portions of each eligible county for purposes of fund allocation under section 106 of the Act on the basis of information available from the U.S. Bureau of the Census with respect to population and other pertinent demographic characteristics, and based on information provided by the county and its included units of general local government.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualification as an urban county.</E> (1) A county will qualify as an urban county if such county meets the definition at § 570.3(3). As necessitated by this definition, the Secretary shall determine which counties have authority to carry out essential community development and housing assistance activities in their included units of general local government without the consent of the local governing body and which counties must execute cooperation agreements with such units to include them in the urban county for qualification and grant calculation purposes.</P>
                <P>(2) At the time of urban county qualification, HUD may refuse to recognize the cooperation agreement of a unit of general local government in an urban county where, based on past performance and other available information, there is substantial evidence that such unit does not cooperate in the implementation of the essential community development or housing assistance activities or where legal impediments to such implementation exist, or where participation by a unit of general local government in noncompliance with the applicable law in subpart K would constitute noncompliance by the urban county. In such a case, the unit of general local government will not be permitted to participate in the urban county, and its population or other needs characteristics will not be considered in the determination of whether the county qualifies as an urban county or in determining the amount of funds to which the urban county may be entitled. HUD will not take this action unless the unit of general local government and the county have been given an opportunity to challenge HUD's determination and to informally consult with HUD concerning the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Essential activities.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “essential community development and housing assistance activities” means community renewal and lower income housing activities, specifically urban renewal and publicly assisted housing. In determining whether a county has the required powers, the Secretary will consider both its authority and, where applicable, the authority of its designated agency or agencies.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Period of qualification.</E> (1) The qualification by HUD of an urban county shall remain effective for three successive Federal fiscal years regardless of changes in its population during that period, except as provided under <PRTPAGE P="45"/>paragraph (f) of this section and except as provided under § 570.3(3) where the period of qualification shall be two successive Federal fiscal years.</P>
                <P>(2) During the period of qualification, no included unit of general local government may withdraw from nor be removed from the urban county for HUD's grant computation purposes.</P>
                <P>(3) If some portion of an urban county's unincorporated area becomes incorporated during the urban county qualification period, the newly incorporated unit of general local government shall not be excluded from the urban county nor shall it be eligible for a separate grant under subpart D, F, or I until the end of the urban county's current qualification period, unless the urban county fails to receive a grant for any year during that qualification period.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Grant ineligibility of included units of general local government.</E> (1) An included unit of general local government cannot become eligible for an entitlement grant as a metropolitan city during the period of qualification of the urban county (even if it becomes a principal city of a metropolitan area or its population surpasses 50,000 during that period). Rather, such a unit of general local government shall continue to be included as part of the urban county for the remainder of the urban county's qualification period, and no separate grant amount shall be calculated for the included unit.</P>
                <P>(2) An included unit of general local government which is part of an urban county shall be ineligible to apply for grants under subpart F, or to be a recipient of assistance under subpart I, during the entire period of urban county qualification.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure of an urban county to receive a grant.</E> Failure of an urban county to receive a grant during any year shall terminate the existing qualification of that urban county, and that county shall requalify as an urban county before receiving an entitlement grant in any successive Federal fiscal year. Such termination shall release units of general local government included in the urban county, in subsequent years, from the prohibition to receive grants under paragraphs (d)(3), (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section. For this purpose an urban county shall be deemed to have received a grant upon having satisfied the requirements of sections 104 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Act, without regard to adjustments which may be made to this grant amount under section 104(e) or 111 of the Act.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Notifications of the opportunity to be excluded.</E> Any county seeking to qualify for an entitlement grant as an urban county for any Federal fiscal year shall notify each unit of general local government which is located, in whole or in part, within the county and which would otherwise be included in the urban county, but which is eligible to elect to have its population excluded from that of the urban county, that it has the opportunity to make such an election, and that such an election, or the failure to make such an election, shall be effective for the period for which the county qualifies as an urban county. These notifications shall be made by a date specified by HUD. A unit of general local government which elects to be excluded from participation as a part of the urban county shall notify the county and HUD in writing by a date specified by HUD. Such a unit of government may subsequently elect to participate in the urban county for the remaining one or two year period by notifying HUD and the county, in writing, of such election by a date specified by HUD.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Joint requests.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Joint requests and cooperation agreements.</E> (1) Any urban county and any metropolitan city located, in whole or in part, within that county may submit a joint request to HUD to approve the inclusion of the metropolitan city as a part of the urban county for purposes of planning and implementing a joint community development and housing program. Such a joint request shall only be considered if submitted at the time the county is seeking a three year qualification or requalification as an urban county. Such a joint request shall, upon approval by HUD, remain effective for the period for which the county is qualified <PRTPAGE P="46"/>as an urban county. An urban county may be joined by more than one metropolitan city, but a metropolitan city located in more than one urban county may only be included in one urban county for any program year. A joint request shall be deemed approved by HUD unless HUD notifies the city and the county of its disapproval and the reasons therefore within 30 days of receipt of the request by HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) Each metropolitan city and urban county submitting a joint request shall submit an executed cooperation agreement to undertake or to assist in the undertaking of essential community development and housing assistance activities, as defined in § 570.307(c).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Joint grant amount.</E> The grant amount for a joint recipient shall be the sum of the amounts authorized for the individual entitlement grantees, as described in section 106 of the Act. The urban county shall be the grant recipient.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of inclusion.</E> Upon urban county qualification and HUD approval of the joint request and cooperation agreement, the metropolitan city shall be considered a part of the urban county for purposes of program planning and implementation for the period of the urban county qualification, and shall be treated the same as any other unit of general local government which is part of the urban county.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission requirements.</E> In requesting a grant under this part, the urban county shall make a single submission which meets the submission requirements of 24 CFR part 91 and covers all members of the joint recipient.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Technical assistance awards.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The purpose of the Community Development Technical Assistance Program is to increase the effectiveness with which States, units of general local government, and Indian tribes plan, develop, and administer assistance under title I and section 810 of the Act. Title I programs are the Entitlement Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart D); the section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart M); the Urban Development Action Grant Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart G); the HUD-administered Small Cities Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart F); the State-administered Program for Non-Entitlement Communities (24 CFR part 570, subpart I); the grants for Indian Tribes program (24 CFR part 571); and the Special Purpose Grants for Insular Areas, Community Development Work Study and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (24 CFR part 570, subpart E).</P>
                <P>(2) Funding under this section is awarded for the provision of technical expertise in planning, managing or carrying out such programs including the activities being or to be assisted thereunder and other actions being or to be undertaken for the purpose of the program, such as increasing the effectiveness of public service and other activities in addressing identified needs, meeting applicable program requirements (e.g., citizen participation, nondiscrimination, 2 CFR part 200, increasing program management or capacity building skills, attracting business or industry to CDBG assisted economic development sites or projects, assisting eligible CDBG subrecipients such as neighborhood nonprofits or small cities in how to obtain CDBG funding from cities and States. The provision of technical expertise in other areas which may have some tangential benefit or effect on a program is insufficient to qualify for funding.</P>
                <P>(3) Awards may be made pursuant to HUD solicitations for assistance applications or procurement contract proposals issued in the form of a publicly available document which invites the submission of applications or proposals within a prescribed period of time. HUD may also enter into agreements with other Federal agencies for awarding the technical assistance funds:</P>
                <P>(i) Where the Secretary determines that such funding procedures will achieve a particular technical assistance objective more effectively and the criteria for making the awards will be consistent with this section, or</P>
                <P>(ii) The transfer of funds to the other Federal agency for use under the terms of the agreement is specifically authorized by law. The Department will not accept or fund unsolicited proposals.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) <E T="03">Areawide planning organization</E> (APO) means an organization authorized by law or local agreement to undertake planning and other activities for a metropolitan or non-metropolitan area.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Technical assistance</E> means the facilitating of skills and knowledge in planning, developing and administering activities under title I and section 810 of the Act in entities that may need but do not possess such skills and knowledge, and includes assessing programs and activities under title I.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible applicants.</E> Eligible applicants for award of technical assistance funding are:</P>
                <P>(1) States, units of general local government, APOs, and Indian Tribes; and</P>

                <P>(2) Public and private non-profit or for-profit groups, including educational institutions, qualified to provide technical assistance to assist such governmental units to carry out the title I or Urban Homesteading programs. An applicant group must be designated as a technical assistance provider to a unit of government's title I program or Urban Homesteading program by the chief executive officer of each unit to be assisted, unless the assistance is limited to conferences/workshops attended by more than one unit of government.<PRTPAGE P="52"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligible activities.</E> Activities eligible for technical assistance funding include:</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Ineligible activities.</E> Activities for which costs are ineligible under this section include:</P>
                <P>(1) In the case of technical assistance for States, the cost of carrying out the administration of the State CDBG program for non-entitlement communities;</P>
                <P>(2) The cost of carrying out the activities authorized under the title I and Urban Homesteading programs, such as the provision of public services, construction, rehabilitation, planning and administration, for which the technical assistance is to be provided;</P>
                <P>(3) The cost of acquiring or developing the specialized skills or knowledge to be provided by a group funded under this section;</P>
                <P>(4) Research activities;</P>

                <P>(f) <E T="03">Criteria for competitive selection.</E> In determining whether to fund competitive applications or proposals under this section, the Department will use the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">For solicited assistance applications.</E> The Department will use two types of criteria for reviewing and selecting competitive assistance applications solicited by HUD:</P>
                <P>(i) Evaluation criteria: These criteria will be used to rank applications according to weights which may vary with each competition:</P>
                <P>(A) Probable effectiveness of the application in meeting needs of localities and accomplishing project objectives;</P>
                <P>(B) Soundness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed approach;</P>
                <P>(C) Capacity of the applicant to carry out the proposed activities in a timely and effective fashion;</P>
                <P>(D) The extent to which the results may be transferable or applicable to other title I or Urban Homesteading program participants.</P>
                <P>(ii) Program policy criteria: These factors may be used by the selecting official to select a range of projects that would best serve program objectives for a particular competition:</P>
                <P>(A) Geographic distribution;</P>
                <P>(B) Diversity of types and sizes of applicant entities; and</P>
                <P>(C) Diversity of methods, approaches, or kinds of projects.</P>

                <FP>The Department will publish a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for each competition indicating the objective of the technical assistance, the amount of funding available, the application procedures, including the eligible applicants and activities to be funded, any special conditions applicable to the solicitation, including any requirements for a matching share or for commitments for CDBG or other title I funding to carry out eligible activities for which the technical assistance is to be provided, the maximum points to be awarded each evaluation criterion for the purpose of ranking applications, and any special factors to be considered in assigning the points to each evaluation criterion. The Notice will also indicate which program policy factors will be used, the impact of those factors on the selection process, the justification for their use and, if appropriate, the relative priority of each program policy factor.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">For competitive procurement contract bids/proposals.</E> The Department's <PRTPAGE P="53"/>criteria for review and selection of solicited bids/proposals for procurement contracts will be described in its public announcement of the availability of an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP). The public notice, solicitation and award of procurement contracts, when used to acquire technical assistance, shall be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1) and the HUD Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 24).</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Submission procedures.</E> Solicited assistance applications shall be submitted in accordance with the time and place and content requirements described in the Department's NOFA. Solicited bids/proposals for procurement contracts shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements in the IFB or RFP.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Approval procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acceptance.</E> HUD's acceptance of an application or proposal for review does not imply a commitment to provide funding.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification.</E> HUD will provide notification of whether a project will be funded or rejected.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Form of award.</E> (i) HUD will award technical assistance funds as a grant, cooperative agreement or procurement contract, consistent with this section, the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, 31 U.S.C. 6301-6308, the HUD Acquisition Regulation, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</P>
                <P>(ii) When HUD's primary purpose is the transfer of technical assistance to assist the recipients in support of the title I or Section 810 programs, an assistance instrument (grant or cooperative agreement) will be used. A grant instrument will be used when substantial Federal involvement is not anticipated. A cooperative agreement will be used when substantial Federal involvement is anticipated. When a cooperative agreement is selected, the agreement will specify the nature of HUD's anticipated involvement in the project.</P>
                <P>(iii) A contract will be used when HUD's primary purpose is to obtain a provider of technical assistance to act on the Department's behalf. In such cases the Department will define the specific tasks to be performed. However, nothing in this section shall preclude the Department from awarding a procurement contract in any other case when it is determined to be in the Department's best interests.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Administration.</E> Project administration will be governed by the terms of individual awards and relevant regulations. As a general rule, proposals will be funded to operate for one to two years, and periodic and final reports will be required.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Environmental and intergovernmental review.</E> The requirements for Environmental Reviews and Intergovernmental Reviews do not apply to technical assistance awards.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Selection of recipients of technical assistance.</E> Where under the terms of the funding award the recipient of the funding is to select the recipients of the technical assistance to be provided, the funding recipient shall publish, and publicly make available to potential technical assistance recipients, the availability of such assistance and the specific criteria to be used for the selection of the recipients to be assisted. Selected recipients must be entities participating or planning to participate in the title I or Urban Homesteading programs or activities for which the technical assistance is to be provided.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Grants under this section will be awarded to historically Black colleges and universities to expand their role and effectiveness in addressing community development needs, including neighborhood revitalization, <PRTPAGE P="54"/>housing and economic development in their localities, consistent with the purposes of title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible applicants.</E> Only historically Black colleges and universities (as determined by the Department of Education in accordance with that Department's responsibilities under Executive Order 12677, dated April 28, 1989) are eligible to submit applications.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible activities.</E> Activities that may be funded under this section are those eligible under §§ 570.201 through 570.207, provided that any activity which is required by State or local law to be carried out by a governmental entity may not be funded under this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 570.200(g), grants under this section are not subject to the 20 percent limitation on planning and program administration costs, as defined in §§ 570.205 and 570.206, respectively.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Applications.</E> Applications will only be accepted from eligible applicants in response to a Request for Applications (RFA) which will be issued either concurrently with or after the publication of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The NOFA will describe any special objectives sought to be achieved by the funding to be provided, including any limitations on the type of activities to be funded to achieve the objectives, points to be awarded to each of the selection criteria listed in paragraph (e) of this section, and any special factors to be evaluated in assigning points under the selection factors to achieve the stated objectives. The NOFA will also state the deadline for the submission of applications, the total funding available for the competition, and the maximum amount of individual grants. The NOFA will include further information and instructions for the submission of acceptable applications to HUD.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Selection criteria.</E> Each application submitted under this section will be evaluated by HUD using the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) The extent to which the applicant addresses the objectives published in the NOFA and the RFA.</P>
                <P>(2) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates to HUD that the proposed activities will have a substantial impact in achieving the stated objectives.</P>
                <P>(3) The special needs of the applicant or locality to be met in carrying out the proposed activities, particularly with respect to benefiting low- and moderate-income persons.</P>
                <P>(4) The feasibility of the proposed activities, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> their technical and financial feasibility, for achieving the stated objectives, including local support for activities proposed to be carried out in the locality and any matching funds proposed to be provided from other sources.</P>
                <P>(5) The capability of the applicant to carry out satisfactorily the proposed activities in a timely fashion, including satisfactory performance in carrying out any previous HUD-assisted projects or activities.</P>
                <P>(6) In the case of proposals/projects of approximately equal merit, HUD retains the right to exercise discretion in selecting projects in a manner that would best serve the program objectives, with consideration given to the needs of localities, types of activities proposed, an equitable geographical distribution, and program balance.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Certifications.</E> (1) Certifications required to be submitted by applicants shall be as prescribed in the RFA packages.</P>
                <P>(2) In the absence of independent evidence which tends to challenge in a substantial manner the certifications made by the applicant, the required certifications will be accepted by HUD. If independent evidence is available to HUD, however, HUD may require further information or assurances to be submitted in order to determine whether the applicant's certifications are satisfactory.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Multiyear funding commitments.</E> (1) HUD may make funding commitments of up to five years, subject to the availability of appropriations. In determining the number of years for which a commitment will be made, HUD will consider the nature of the activities proposed, the capability of the recipient to carry out the proposed activities, and year-by-year funding requirements.</P>

                <P>(2) Awards will be made on the basis of a 12-month period of performance. <PRTPAGE P="55"/>Once a recipient has been selected for a multi-year award, that recipient would not be required to compete in a competition for the subsequent funding years covered by the multi-year funding commitment. Recipients performing satisfactorily will be invited to submit applications for subsequent funding years in accordance with requirements outlined in the Notice of Funding Availability and Request for Grant Application. Subject to the availability of appropriations, subsequent-year funding will be determined by the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The recipient has submitted all reports required for the previous year or years in a timely, complete and satisfactory manner in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant.</P>
                <P>(ii) The recipient has submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate successful completion of the tasks and deliverables of the grant. A determination of satisfactory performance will be made by HUD based upon evidence of task completions provided by the recipient, along with data from client feedback and site evaluations.</P>
                <P>(iii) The recipient has submitted the next annual application.</P>
                <P>(iv) The subsequent year's application is consistent with that described in the original application.</P>
                <P>(3) Recipients participating in multi-year funding projects are not eligible to apply for additional grants for the same project or activity subject area for which they are receiving funds. Recipients are, however, eligible to compete for grants for other project or activity areas.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Selection and notification.</E> The HUD decision to approve, disapprove or conditionally approve an application shall be communicated in writing to the applicant.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Environmental and intergovernmental review.</E> The requirements for Intergovernmental Reviews do not apply to HBCU awards. HUD will conduct an environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50 before giving its approval to a proposal.</P>

                <SUBJECT>The insular areas.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible applicants.</E> Eligible applicants are Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Threshold requirements.</E> HUD shall review each grantee's progress on outstanding grants made under this section based on the grantee's performance report, the timeliness of close-outs and compliance with fund management requirements and pertinent regulations, taking into consideration the size of the grant and the degree and complexity of the program. If HUD determines upon such review that the applicant does not have the capacity effectively to administer a new grant, or a portion of a new grant, in addition to grants currently under administration, the applicant shall not be invited to submit an application for the current year's funding.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Previous audit findings and outstanding monetary obligations.</E> HUD shall not accept for review an application from an applicant that has either an outstanding audit finding for any HUD program, or an outstanding monetary obligation to HUD that is in arrears, or for which a repayment schedule has not been established and agreed to. The Field Office manager may waive this restriction if he or she finds that the applicant has made a good faith effort to clear the audit. In no instance, however, shall a waiver be provided when funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the debt has been made and payments are current.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Criteria for funding.</E> The Secretary shall establish, for each fiscal year, an amount for which eligible applicants may apply. Grant amounts will be based on population of the applicant and its performance in previous years. In determining performance, HUD will consider program achievements and the applicant's effectiveness in using program funds. Effectiveness in using program funds shall be measured by reviewing audit, monitoring and performance reports.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Application and performance reporting.</E> Application and performance reporting requirements are as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) Applicants must submit applications within 90 days of the notification of the grant amount from HUD.<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Applicants shall prepare and publish or post a proposed application in accordance with the citizen participation requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Applicants shall submit to HUD a final application containing its community development objectives and activities. This application shall be submitted to the appropriate HUD office, together with the required certifications, in a form prescribed by HUD.</P>
                <P>(4) Grant recipients must submit to HUD an annual performance report on progress achieved on previously funded grants. Grant recipients must submit the report at a time and in a format determined by HUD. The report should be made available to citizens in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Costs incurred by the applicant.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, HUD will not reimburse or recognize any costs incurred by an applicant before submission of the application to HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) Normally, HUD will not reimburse or recognize costs incurred before HUD approval of the application for funding. However, under unusual circumstances, the Field office manager may consider and conditionally approve written requests to recognize and reimburse costs that will be incurred after submission of the application but before it is approved where failure to do so would impose undue or unreasonable hardship on the applicant. Conditional approvals will be made only before the costs are incurred and where the conditions for release of funds have been met in accordance with 24 CFR 58.22, and with the understanding that HUD has no obligation whatsoever to approve the application or to reimburse the applicant should the application be disapproved.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Criteria for conditional approval.</E> HUD may approve a grant subject to specified conditions. In any such case, the obligation and utilization of funds may be restricted. The reasons for the conditional approval and the actions necessary to remove the conditions shall be specified. Failure of the applicant to satisfy the conditions may result in a termination of the grant. A conditional approval may be granted under any of the following circumstances:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Joint Community Development Program.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Grants under this section will be awarded to institutions of higher education or to States and local governments applying jointly with institutions of higher education. Institutions of higher education must demonstrate the capacity to carry out activities under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. For ease of reference, this program may be called the Joint CD Program.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
                </P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Demonstrated capacity</E> to carry out eligible activities under title I means recent satisfactory activity by the institution of higher education's staff designated to work on the program, including subcontractors and consultants firmly committed to work on the proposed activities, in title I programs or similar programs without the need for oversight by a State or unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Institution of higher education</E> means a college or university granting 4-year degrees and accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible applicants.</E> Institutions of higher education or States and units of general local government jointly with institutions of higher education may apply. Institutions of higher education with demonstrated capacity to carry <PRTPAGE P="59"/>out eligible activities under title I may apply on their own, without the joint participation of a State or unit of general local government. States or unit of general local governments must file jointly with an institution of higher education. For these approved joint applications, the grant will be made to the State or unit of general local government and the institution of higher education jointly. If an eligible applicant is an institution of higher education, it will not be funded more than once for the same kinds of activities. These grantees may not receive funding under a subsequent NOFA if it has the same program objectives as the one under which the grantee previously received funding. However, a State or unit of general local government is eligible to apply if it files jointly with a different institution of higher education in each NOFA cycle. HUD may further limit the type of eligible applicant to be funded. Any such limitations will be contained in the Notice of Funding Availability described below in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Role of participants in joint applications.</E> An institution of higher education and a State or unit of general local government may carry out eligible activities approved in joint applications. Where there are joint applicants, the grant will be made to both and both will be responsible for oversight, compliance, and performance. The application will have to clearly delineate the role of each applicant in the joint application. Any funding sanctions or other remedial actions by HUD for noncompliance or nonperformance, whether by the State or unit of general local government or by the institution of higher education, shall be taken against both grantees.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Eligible activities.</E> Activities that may be funded under this section are those eligible under 24 CFR part 570—Community Development Block Grants, subpart C—Eligible Activities. These activities may be designed to assist residents of colonias, as defined in section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 5306 note), to improve living conditions and standards within colonias. HUD may limit the activities to be funded. Any such limitations will be contained in the Notice of Funding Availability described in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Applications.</E> Applications will only be accepted from eligible applicants in response to a publication of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published by HUD in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Local approval.</E> (1) Where an institution of higher education is the applicant, each unit of general local government that is an entitlement jurisdiction where an activity is to take place must approve the activity and certify that the activity is consistent with its Consolidated Plan.</P>
                <P>(2) Where a State is the joint applicant and it proposes to carry out an activity within the jurisdiction of one or more units of general local government, then each such unit must approve the activity and state that the activity is consistent with its Consolidated Plan.</P>
                <P>(3) These approvals and findings must accompany each application and may take the form of a letter by the chief executive officer of each unit of general local government affected or a resolution of the legislative body of each such unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">NOFA contents.</E> The NOFA will describe any special objectives sought to be achieved by the funding to be provided, including any limitations on the type of activities to be funded to achieve the objectives, any limitations on the type of eligible applicants, and points to be awarded to each of the selection criteria and any special factors to be evaluated in assigning points under the selection criteria to achieve the stated objectives. The NOFA will also state the deadline for the submission of applications, the total funding available for the competition, the period of performance and the maximum and minimum amount of individual grants. The NOFA will also state which of the various possible levels of competition HUD will use: national and/or regional or entitlement areas vs. non-entitlement areas; and States or units <PRTPAGE P="60"/>of general local government vs. institutions of higher education vs. institutions of higher education with a demonstrated capacity. The NOFA will include further information and instructions for the submission of acceptable applications to HUD.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Selection criteria.</E> Each application submitted under this section will be evaluated by HUD using the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) The extent to which the applicant addresses the objectives published in the NOFA and demonstrates how the proposed activities will have a substantial impact in achieving the objectives.</P>
                <P>(2) The extent of the needs to be addressed by the proposed activities, particularly with respect to benefiting low- and moderate-income persons and residents of colonias, where applicable.</P>
                <P>(3) The feasibility of the proposed activities, i.e., their technical and financial feasibility, for achieving the stated objectives.</P>
                <P>(4) The capability of the applicant to carry out satisfactorily the proposed activities in a timely fashion, including satisfactory performance in carrying out any previous HUD-assisted projects or activities.</P>
                <P>(5) The extent of commitment to fair housing and equal opportunity, as indicated by such factors as previous HUD monitoring/compliance activity, actions to promote minority- and women-owned business enterprise, affirmatively furthering fair housing issues, and nondiscriminatory delivery of services.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Selection discretion.</E> HUD retains the right to exercise discretion in selecting projects in a manner that would best serve the program objectives, with consideration given to the needs of States and units of general local government and institutions of higher education, types of activities proposed, an equitable geographical distribution, and program balance. The NOFA will state whether HUD will use this discretion in any specific competition.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Certifications.</E> (1) Certifications, including those indicating that applicants have adhered to all civil rights requirements under subpart K of this part and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, required to be submitted by applicants shall be as prescribed in the NOFA.</P>
                <P>(2) In the absence of independent evidence which tends to challenge in a substantial manner the certifications made by the applicant, the required certifications will be accepted by HUD. However, if independent evidence is available, HUD may require further information or assurances to be submitted in order to determine whether the applicant's certifications are satisfactory.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Consolidated plan.</E> An applicant that proposes any housing activities as part of its application will be required to submit a certification that these activities are consistent with the Consolidated Plan of the jurisdiction to be served.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Citizen participation.</E> The citizen participation requirements of §§ 570.301, 570.431, 570.485(c) and 570.486(a) are modified to require the following: The applicant must certify that citizens likely to be affected by the project regardless of race, color, creed, sex, national origin, familial status, or handicap, particularly low- and moderate-income persons, have been provided an opportunity to comment on the proposal or application.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Environmental and Intergovernmental Review.</E> The requirements for Intergovernmental Reviews do not apply to these awards. When required, an environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 58 must be carried out by the State or unit of general local government when it is the applicant. HUD will conduct any required environmental review when an institution of higher education is the applicant.</P>

The administrative allowance is $1,000 per year for each student participating in the program; however, no more than 20 percent of the grant may be used for planning and program administrative costs.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Number of students assisted.</E> The minimum number of students that may be assisted is three students per participating institution of higher education. The maximum number of students that may be assisted is ten students per participating institution of higher education; however, a lower maximum or higher minimum may be established for a particular funding round by the NOFA announcing the availability of the funds.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Recipient eligibility and responsibilities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Recipient eligibility.</E> Public or private Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education offering only undergraduate two-year degrees, including degrees in at least one community building academic program, are eligible for assistance under HSI-WSP. HSIs that offer BOTH two-year and four-year degrees are not eligible for HSI-WSP assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Recipient responsibilities.</E> The recipient is responsible for administering the program, for compliance with all program requirements, and for coordination of program activities carried out by the work placement agencies. The recipient must:<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Recruit students for participation in HSI-WSP. The recipient shall establish recruitment procedures that identify eligible economically disadvantaged and minority students pursuing careers in community building, and make them aware of the availability of assistance opportunities. While the program is restricted to HSIs, the recipient may neither restrict the program to any particular minority group or groups, nor provide any preferential treatment in the selection process based on race or ethnicity. Only economically disadvantaged students, as defined herein, may be assisted.</P>
                <P>(ii) Select students for participation in HSI-WSP. In selecting among the eligible students, the recipient must consider the extent to which each student has demonstrated financial need under the applicable guidelines established at the institution of higher education; an interest in, and commitment to, a career in community building; and the ability to satisfactorily complete the academic and work placement responsibilities under HSI-WSP. Students must be selected before the beginning of the semester for which funding is being provided. If a student's participation terminates, the student may not be replaced; the grant will be reduced by the amount of unused funds allotted for that student.</P>
                <P>(iii) Provide the educational component for participating students.</P>
                <P>(iv) Recruit and select work placement agencies, and negotiate and execute an agreement covering each work placement assignment.</P>
                <P>(v) Refer participating students to work placement agencies and assist students in the selection of work placement assignments.</P>
                <P>(vi) Assign sufficient staff to administer and supervise the program on a day-to-day basis.</P>
                <P>(vii) Encourage participating students to either: obtain post-graduation employment with a unit of State or local government, an areawide planning organization (APO), Indian tribe or nonprofit organization engaged in community building; or transfer to a four-year institution of higher education to obtain a bachelor's degree in a community building academic discipline.</P>
                <P>(viii) Maintain records by racial and ethnic categories for each economically disadvantaged and minority student participating in HSI-WSP.</P>
                <P>(ix) Keep records and make such reports as HUD may require.</P>
                <P>(x) Comply with all other applicable Federal requirements.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Work placement agencies eligibility and responsibilities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> To be eligible to participate in HSI-WSP, the work placement agency must be an agency of a State or local government, an APO, an Indian tribe, or a private nonprofit organization involved in community building activities. A work placement site that is part of the institution of higher education (e.g., a child care center) can only be an eligible site if the services provided by that site are offered to people in the broader community outside the institution.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Responsibilities.</E> Work placement agencies must:</P>
                <P>(i) Provide practical experience and training in the community building field to participating students through work placement assignments.</P>

                <P>(iv) May not have previously participated in HSI-WSP.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Student responsibilities.</E> Participating students must:</P>
                <P>(i) Enroll or be enrolled in a two-year community building associate degree program. A student's academic and work placement responsibilities include: Full-time enrollment in an approved academic program; maintenance of a satisfactory level of performance in the community building academic program and in work placement assignments; and compliance with the professional conduct standards set by the recipient and by the work placement agency. A satisfactory level of academic performance consists of maintaining a B average, as defined by the institution. A student's participation in HSI-WSP shall be terminated for failure to meet these responsibilities and standards. If the student's participation is terminated, the student is ineligible for further HSI-WSP assistance.</P>
                <P>(ii) Devote 12-20 hours per week during the regular school year, and 35-40 hours a week during the summer, to the work placement assignment. Work placement agencies may provide flexibility in the work period, if such a schedule is consistent with the requirements of the student's academic program. However, a participating student may receive a stipend payment only during the period when the student is placed with the work placement agency.</P>
                <P>(iii) Agree to make a good-faith effort to either: obtain employment in community building with a unit of State or local government, an APO, an Indian tribe, or a non-profit organization; or to transfer to a four-year institution of higher education to obtain a bachelor's degree in a community building academic discipline. However, if the student does not obtain such employment or transfer to a four-year institution, the student is not required to repay the assistance received.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of funding availability.</E> HUD will solicit grant applications from eligible institutions of higher education by publishing a notice of funding availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The notice will:</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Administration of Non-entitlement CDBG funds in New York by HUD or Insular Areas</E>—(1) <E T="03">Small cities.</E> The Act permits each state to elect to administer all aspects of the CDBG program annual fund allocation for the non-entitlement areas within its jurisdiction. All states except Hawaii have elected to administer the CDBG program for non-entitlement areas within their jurisdiction. This section is applicable only to active HUD-administered small cities grants in New York. The requirements for the non-entitlement CDBG grants in Hawaii are set forth in § 570.429 of this subpart. States that elected to administer the program after the close of Fiscal Year 1984 cannot return administration of the program to HUD. A decision by a state to discontinue administration of the program would result in the loss of CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas in that state and the reallocation of those funds to all states in the succeeding fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Insular areas.</E> Title V of Public Law 108-186 amended the Act to move the insular areas funding authorization from sections 107(a) and (b) to section 106(a). This revision identified a specific portion of the CDBG allocation for insular areas that is separate from the distribution for special purpose grants, as well as from the Entitlement and State formula distribution. The insular areas of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa are permitted to administer all aspects of their Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program under section 106 of the Act in accordance with their final statement as further described at § 570.440.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope and applicability.</E> (1) This subpart describes the policies and procedures of the Small Cities program that apply to non-entitlement areas in states where HUD administers the CDBG program. HUD currently administers the Small Cities program in only two states—New York (for grants prior to FY 2000) and Hawaii (for non-entitlement CDBG grants in Hawaii). The Small Cities portion of this subpart addresses the requirements for New York Small Cities grants in §§ 570.421, 570.426, 570.427, and 570.431. Section 570.429 identifies special procedures applicable to Hawaii.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) This subpart also describes the policies and procedures governing community development block grants to insular areas under section 106 of the Act. Sections 570.440 and 570.441 identify procedures applicable to the Insular Areas program under section 106 of the Act. Fund reservations for insular areas under section 107 of the Act shall remain governed by the policies and procedures described in section 107(a)(1)(A) of the Act and §§ 570.400 and 570.405 of this part.</P>
                <P>(3) The policies and procedures set forth in the following identified subparts of this part apply to the HUD-administered Small Cities and Insular Areas programs, except as modified or limited under the provisions thereof or this subpart:</P>
                <P>(i) Subpart A—General Provisions;</P>
                <P>(ii) Subpart C—Eligible Activities;</P>
                <P>(iii) Subpart J—Grant Administration;</P>
                <P>(iv) Subpart K—Other Program Requirements;</P>
                <P>(v) Subpart M—Loan Guarantees; and</P>
                <P>(vi) Subpart O—Performance Reviews.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Abbreviated consolidated plan.</E> Applications for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program and the Insular Areas program under section 106 of the Act that contain housing activities must include a certification that the proposed housing activities are consistent with the applicant's consolidated plan as described at 24 CFR part 91.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">National and primary objectives.</E> (1) Each activity funded through the Small Cities program and the Insular Areas program under section 106 of the Act must meet one of the following national objectives as defined under the criteria in § 570.208:</P>
                <P>(i) Benefit low- and moderate-income families;</P>
                <P>(ii) Aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Be an activity that the grantee certifies is designed to meet other community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community and other financial resources are not available to meet such needs.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition to the objectives described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, with respect to grants made through the Small Cities program, not less than 70 percent of the total of grant funds from each grant and Section 108 loan guarantee funds received under subpart M of this part within a fiscal year must be expended for activities which benefit low- and moderate-income persons under the criteria of § 570.208(a) or of § 570.208(d)(5) or (6). In the case of multiyear plans in New York State approved in response to NOFAs published prior to calendar year 1997, not less than 70 percent of the total funding for grants approved pursuant to a multiyear plan for a time period of up to three years must be expended for activities which benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Thus, 70 percent of the grant for year 1 of a multiyear plan approved in response to NOFAs published prior to calendar year 1997 must meet the 70 percent requirement, 70 percent of the combined grants from years 1 and 2 must meet the requirement, and 70 percent of the combined grants from years 1, 2, and 3 must meet the requirement. In determining the percentage of funds expended for such activity, the provisions of § 570.200(a)(3)(i), (iii), (iv), and (v) shall apply.</P>
                <P>(3) In addition to the objectives described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, grants made through the Insular Areas program shall also comply with the primary objective of 70 percent benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. Insular area recipients must meet this requirement for each separate grant under section 107 of the Act. For grants made under section 106 of the Act, insular area recipients must ensure that over a period of time specified in their certifications not to exceed three years, not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of CDBG fund expenditures shall be for low- and moderate-income activities meeting the criteria under § 570.208(a) or under § 570.208(d)(5) or (6). See also § 570.200(a)(3) for further discussion of the primary objective.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Allocation of funds</E>—The allocation of appropriated funds for insular areas under section 106 of the Act shall be <PRTPAGE P="73"/>governed by the policies and procedures described in section 106(a)(2) of the Act and §§ 570.440, 570.441, and 570.442 of this subpart. The annual appropriations described in this section shall be distributed to insular areas on the basis of the ratio of the population of each insular area to the population of all insular areas.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Selection system</E>—(1) <E T="03">Competitive applications.</E> Each competitive application will be rated and scored against at least the following factors:</P>
                <P>(i) Need-absolute number of persons in poverty as further explained in the NOFA;</P>
                <P>(ii) Need-percent of persons in poverty as further explained in the NOFA;</P>
                <P>(iii) Program Impact; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which may include the applicant's Section 3 plan and implementation efforts with respect to actions to affirmatively further fair housing. The NOFA described in paragraph (b) of this section will contain a more detailed description of these factors, and the relative weight that each factor will be given.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition HUD reserves the right to establish minimal thresholds for selection factors and otherwise select grants in accordance with § 570.425 and the applicable NOFA.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Imminent threats to public health and safety.</E> The criteria for these grants are described in § 570.424.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Repayment of Section 108 loans.</E> The criteria for these grants are described in § 570.432.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Economic development grants.</E> HUD intends to use the Section 108 loan guarantee program to the maximum extent feasible to fund economic development projects in the nonentitlement areas of New York. In the event that there are not enough Section 108 loan guarantee funds available to fund viable economic development projects, if a project needs a grant in addition to a loan guarantee to make it viable, or if the project does not meet the requirements of the Section 108 program but is eligible for a grant under this subpart, HUD may fund Economic Development applications as they are determined to be fundable in a specific amount by HUD up to the sum set aside for economic development projects in a notice of funding availability, notwithstanding paragraph (g) of this section. HUD also has the option in a NOFA of funding economic development activities on a competitive basis, as a competitive application as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In order for an applicant to receive Small Cities grant funds on a noncompetitive basis, the field office must determine that the economic development project will have a substantial impact on the needs identified by the applicant.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of funding availability.</E> HUD will issue one or more Notice(s) of Funding Availability (NOFA) each fiscal year which will indicate the amount of funds available, the annual grant limits per grantee, type of grants available, the application requirements, and the rating factors that will be used for those grants which are competitive. A NOFA may set forth, subject to the requirements of this subpart, additional selection criteria for all grants.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible applicants.</E> (1) Eligible applicants in New York are units of general local government, excluding: Metropolitan cities, urban counties, units of general local government which are participating in urban counties or metropolitan cities, even if only part of the participating unit of government is located in the urban county or metropolitan city. Indian tribes are also ineligible for assistance under this subpart. An application may be submitted individually or jointly by eligible applicants.</P>

                <P>(2) Counties, cities, towns, and villages may apply and receive funding for separate projects to be done in the same jurisdiction. Only one grant will be made under each funding round for the same type of project to be located within the jurisdiction of a unit of general local government (e.g., both the county and village cannot receive funding for a sewer system to be located in the same village, but the county can receive funding for a sewer system that is located in the same village as a rehabilitation project for which the village <PRTPAGE P="74"/>receives funding). The NOFA will contain additional information on applicant eligibility.</P>
                <P>(3) Counties may apply on behalf of units of general local government located within their jurisdiction when the unit of general local government has authorized the county to apply. At the time that the county submits its application for funding, it must submit a resolution by the governing body of the unit of local government that authorizes the county to submit an application on behalf of the unit of general local government. The county will be considered the grantee and will be responsible for executing all grant documents. The county is responsible for ensuring compliance with all laws, regulations, and Executive Orders applicable to the CDBG Program. HUD will deal exclusively with the county with respect to issues of program administration and performance, including remedial actions. The unit of general local government will be considered the grantee for the purpose of determining grant limits. The unit of general local government's statistics will be used for purposes of the selection factors referred to in § 570.421(a).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Public service activities cap.</E> Public service activities may be funded up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent of a State's nonentitlement allocation for any fiscal year. HUD may award a grant to a unit of general local government for public service activities with up to 100 percent of the funds intended for public service activities. HUD will apply the 15 percent statewide cap to public service activities by funding public service activities in the highest rated applications in each NOFA until the cap is reached.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Activities outside an applicant's boundaries.</E> An applicant may conduct eligible CDBG activities outside its boundaries. These activities must be demonstrated to be appropriate to meeting the applicant's needs and objectives, and must be consistent with State and local law. This provision includes using funds provided under this subpart in a metropolitan city or an urban county.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Multiyear plans.</E> HUD will not make any new multiyear commitments for NOFAs published in calendar year 1997 or later. HUD will continue to honor the terms of the multiyear plans that were approved under the provisions of NOFAs published prior to calendar year 1997.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Maximum grant amount.</E> The maximum grant amount that will be awarded to a single unit of general local government in response to the annual Small Cities NOFA published in calendar year 1997 or later is $400,000, except that counties may apply for up to $600,000 in HUD-administered Small Cities funds. HUD may specify lower grant limits in the NOFA, which may include different limits for different types of grants available or different types of applicants. This paragraph (g) does not apply to multiyear plans that were approved under the provisions of NOFAs published prior to calendar year 1997, nor does it apply to grants awarded in connection with paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section. The maximum limits in this paragraph (g) apply to grants for economic development projects awarded under NOFAs in which there is no set-aside of funds for such projects.</P>

                <P>(a) The provisions of § 570.504(b) apply to all program income generated by a specific grant and received prior to grant closeout.</P>
                <P>(b) If the unit of general local government has another ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, the program income will be considered to be program income of the ongoing grant. The grantee can choose which grant to credit the program income to if it has multiple open CDBG grants.</P>

                <P>(c) If the unit of general local government has no open ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of the unit of general local government or its subrecipients which amounts to less than $25,000 per year will not be considered to be program income unless needed to repay a Section 108 guaranteed loan. When more than $25,000 of program income is generated from one or more closed out grants in a year after closeout, the entire amount of the program income is subject to the requirements of this <PRTPAGE P="75"/>part. This will be a subject of the closeout agreement described in § 570.509(c).</P>

                <P>(iii) The extent of housing overcrowding in that eligible unit of general local government and the extent of housing overcrowding in all the eligible units of general local government in the nonentitlement areas of the State.</P>
                <P>(2) In determining the average of the ratios under this paragraph (c), the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted twice and each of the other ratios shall be counted once. (0.25 + 0.50 + 0.25 = 1.00).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Reallocation.</E> (1) Any amounts that become available as a result of any reductions under subpart O of this part shall be reallocated in the same or future fiscal year to any remaining eligible applicants on a pro rata basis.</P>

                <P>(3) No amounts shall be reallocated under paragraph (d) of this section in any fiscal year to any applicant whose grant amount was reduced under subpart O of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The requirements of this section apply to insular grants funded under section 106 of the Act. An insular area jurisdiction may choose to prepare program statements following either:</P>
                <P>(1) The abbreviated consolidated plan procedures described in this subpart and in 24 CFR 91.235; or</P>
                <P>(2) The complete consolidated plan procedures applicable to local governments, discussed at 24 CFR 91.200 through 91.230.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Proposed statement.</E> An insular area jurisdiction shall prepare and publish a proposed statement and comply with the citizen participation requirements described in § 570.441, if it submits an abbreviated consolidated plan under 24 CFR 91.235. The jurisdiction shall follow the citizen participation requirements of 24 CFR 91.105 and 91.100 (with the exception of § 91.100(a)(4)), if it submits a complete consolidated plan.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Final statement.</E> The insular area jurisdiction shall submit to HUD a final statement describing its community development objectives and activities. The statement also must include a priority nonhousing community development plan in accordance with 24 CFR 91.235. This final statement shall be submitted, together with the required certifications, to the appropriate field office in a form prescribed by HUD.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission requirement.</E> Each insular area jurisdiction shall submit its final statement to HUD no later than 45 days before the start of its program year. Each jurisdiction may choose the start date for the annual period of its program year that most closely fits its own needs. HUD may grant an extension of the submission deadline for good cause.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Certifications.</E> The insular area jurisdiction's final statement must be accompanied by appropriate certifications as further described under 24 CFR 91.225. The jurisdiction should submit all general certifications, as well as all program certifications for each program from which it receives funding, if it submits a complete consolidated plan. For insular area jurisdictions receiving CDBG funds under an abbreviated consolidated plan, these certifications shall include at a minimum:</P>
                <P>(1) The following general certifications described at § 91.225(a) of this title: Affirmatively furthering fair housing; anti-displacement and relocation plan; drug-free workplace; anti-lobbying; authority of jurisdiction; consistency with plan; acquisition and relocation; and Section 3.</P>

                <P>(f) <E T="03">HUD action on final statement.</E> Following the review of the statement, HUD will promptly notify each jurisdiction of the action taken with regard to its statement. HUD will approve a grant if the jurisdiction's submissions <PRTPAGE P="78"/>have been made and approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 91, and if the certifications required in such submissions are satisfactory to HUD. The certifications will be satisfactory to HUD for this purpose, unless HUD determines pursuant to subpart O of this part that the jurisdiction has not complied with the requirements of this part, has failed to carry out its consolidated plan (or abbreviated consolidated plan) as provided under § 570.903, or has determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the jurisdiction's past performance under this program, that tends to challenge in a substantial manner the jurisdiction's certification of future performance. If HUD makes any such determination, however, further assurances may be required to be submitted by the jurisdiction as HUD may deem warranted or necessary to find the jurisdiction's certification satisfactory.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Reimbursement for pre-award costs.</E> Insular area jurisdictions may request reimbursement for pre-award costs in accordance with § 570.200(h).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Float funding.</E> An insular area jurisdiction may use undisbursed funds in the line of credit and its CDBG program account that are budgeted in final statements or action plans for one or more activities that do not need the funds immediately, subject to the limitations described in § 570.301(b).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Program amendments.</E> (1) The insular area jurisdiction's citizen participation plan (<E T="03">see</E> § 570.441) must specify the criteria the jurisdiction will use for determining what changes in the jurisdiction's planned or actual activities will constitute a substantial amendment to its final statement. It must include changes in the use of CDBG funds from one eligible activity to another among the changes that qualify as a substantial amendment.</P>
                <P>(2) The citizen participation plan must provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on substantial amendments. The citizen participation plan must state how reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment will be given, as well as provide a period of not less than 30 days to receive comments on the substantial amendment before the amendment is implemented.</P>
                <P>(3) The citizen participation plan shall require the jurisdiction to consider comments or views of citizens received in writing, or orally at public hearings, if any, in preparing the substantial amendment of its statement. A summary of comments or views not accepted and the reasons for non-acceptance shall be attached to the substantial amendment.</P>
                <P>(4) Any program amendment, regardless of whether it is considered to be substantial, must be fully documented in the jurisdiction's records.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Performance reports.</E> Each insular area jurisdiction must submit annual performance reports in accordance with 24 CFR 91.520.</P>

                <P>(c) No amounts shall be reallocated under this section in any fiscal year to any applicant whose grant amount in such fiscal year was reduced under subpart O of this part or who did not submit a final statement in accordance with § 570.440 for that fiscal year.</P>

                <P>(d) Insular Area grantees receiving additional funds under this section will be evaluated for timeliness under <PRTPAGE P="81"/>§ 570.902 based upon the original grant amount plus the additional funds received. Accordingly, references in § 570.902 to an Insular Area's grant amount for its current program year include such additional funds, and references to unexpended or undisbursed funds include such additional funds.</P>

                <P>The purpose of urban development action grants is to assist cities and urban counties that are experiencing severe economic distress to help stimulate economic development activity needed to aid in economic recovery. This subpart G contains those regulations that are essential for the continued operation of this grant program.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Ineligible activities and limitations on eligible activities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Large cities and urban counties may not use assistance under this subpart for planning the project or developing the application. However, they may use entitlement community development block grant funds for this purpose, provided that the UDAG project meets the eligibility test of this part. Any small city which submits a project application which is selected for preliminary approval and for which legally binding grant agreement and for which a release of funds pursuant to 24 CFR part 58 has been issued may devote up to three (3) percent of the approved amount of its action grant to defray its actual costs in planning the project and preparing its application.</P>
                <P>(b) Assistance under this subpart may not be used for public services as described in § 570.201(e).</P>
                <P>(c)(1) No assistance may be provided under this subpart for speculative projects intended to facilitate the relocation of industrial or commercial plants or facilities from one area to another. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply to a relocation of any such plant or facility within a metropolitan area.</P>
                <P>(i) HUD will presume that a proposed project which includes speculative commercial or industrial space is intended to facilitate the relocation of a plant or facility from one area to another, if it is demonstrated to HUD's satisfaction that:</P>
                <P>(A) The proposed project is reasonably proximate (i.e., within 50 miles) to an area from which there has been a significant current pattern of movement, to areas reasonably proximate, of jobs of the category for which such space is appropriate; and</P>
                <P>(B) There is a likelihood of continuation of the pattern, based on measurable comparisons between the area from which the movement has been occurring and the area of the proposed project in terms of tax rates, energy costs, and similar relevant factors.</P>
                <P>(ii) The restrictions established in this paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply if the Secretary determines that the relocation does not significantly and adversely affect the employment or economic base of the area from which the industrial or commercial plant or facility is to be relocated. However, the Secretary will not be required to make a determination whether there is a significant and adverse effect. If such a determination is undertaken, the Secretary will presume that there is a significant and adverse effect where the significant pattern of job movement and the likelihood of continuation of such a pattern has been from a distressed community.</P>
                <P>(iii) The presumptions established in accordance with this paragraph (c)(1) are rebuttable by the applicant. However, the burden of overcoming the presumptions will be on the applicant.</P>
                <P>(iv) The presumptions established in this paragraph (c)(1) will not apply if the speculative space contained in a commercial or industrial plant or facility included in a project constitutes a lesser percentage of the total space contained in that plant or facility than the threshold amounts specified below:</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Projects with identified intended occupants.</E> No assistance may be provided or utilized under this subpart for any project with identified intended occupants that is likely to facilitate:</P>
                <P>(i) A relocation of any operation of an industrial or commercial plant or facility or other business establishment from any UDAG eligible jurisdiction; or</P>
                <P>(ii) An expansion of any operation of an industrial or commercial plant or facility or other business establishment that results in a substantial reduction of any such operation in any UDAG eligible jurisdiction. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply to a relocation of an operation or to an expansion of an operation within a metropolitan area. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) shall apply only to projects that do not have speculative space, or to projects that include both identified intended occupant space and speculative space.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Significant and adverse effect.</E> The restrictions established in this paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply if the Secretary determines that the relocation or expansion does not significantly and adversely affect the employment or economic base of the UDAG eligible jurisdiction from which the relocation or expansion occurs. However, the Secretary will not be required to make a determination whether there is a significant and adverse effect. If such a determination is undertaken, among the factors which the Secretary will consider are:</P>
                <P>(A) Whether it is reasonable to anticipate that there will be a significant net loss of jobs in the plant or facility being abandoned; and</P>
                <P>(B) Whether an equivalent productive use will be made of the plant or facility being abandoned by the relocating or expanding operation, thus creating no deterioration of economic base.</P>
                <P>(3) Within 90 days following notice of intent to withhold, deny or cancel assistance under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, the applicant may appeal in writing to the Secretary the withholding, denial or cancellation of assistance. The applicant will be notified and given an opportunity within a prescribed time for an informal consultation regarding the action.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Assistance for individuals adversely affected by prohibited relocations.</E> (i) Any amount withdrawn by, recaptured by, or paid to the Secretary because of a violation (or a settlement of an alleged violation) of this section (or any regulation issued or contractual provision entered into to carry out this section) by a project with identified intended occupants will be made available by the Secretary as a grant to the UDAG eligible jurisdiction from which the operation of an industrial or commercial plant or facility or other business establishment was relocated, or in which the operation was reduced.</P>
                <P>(ii)(A) Any amount made available under this paragraph shall be used by the grantee to assist individuals who were employed by the operation involved before the relocation or reduction and whose employment or terms of employment were adversely affected by the relocation or reduction. The assistance shall include job training, job retraining, and job placement.</P>
                <P>(B) If any amount made available to a grantee under this paragraph (c)(4) is more than is required to provide the assistance described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall use the excess amount to carry out community development activities eligible under section 105(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.</P>
                <P>(iii)(A) The provisions of this paragraph (c)(4) shall be applicable to any amount withdrawn by, recaptured by, or paid to the Secretary under this section, including any amount withdrawn, recaptured, or paid before the effective date of this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(B) Grants may be made under this paragraph (c)(4) only to the extent of amounts provided in appropriation Acts.</P>

                <P>(5) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:<PRTPAGE P="83"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) “Operation” means any plant, equipment, facility, substantial number of positions, substantial employment opportunities, production capacity, or product line.</P>
                <P>(ii) “Metropolitan area” means a metropolitan area as defined in § 570.3 and which consists of either a freestanding metropolitan area or a primary metropolitan statistical area where both primary and consolidated areas exist.</P>
                <P>(iii) “Likely” means probably or reasonably to be expected, as determined by firm evidence such as resolutions of a corporation to close a plant or facility, notifications of closure to collective bargaining units, correspondence and notifications of corporate officials relative to a closure, and supportive evidence, such as newspaper articles and notices to employees regarding closure of a plant or facility. Consultant studies and marketing studies may be submitted as supportive evidence, but by themselves are not firm evidence.</P>
                <P>(iv) “UDAG eligible jurisdiction” means a distressed community, a Pocket of Poverty, a Pocket of Poverty community, or an identifiable community described in section 119(p) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.</P>
                <P>(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, nothing in this subpart may be construed to permit an inference or conclusion that the policy of the urban development action grant program is to facilitate the relocation of businesses from one area to another.</P>

                <P>Applicants for Action Grants under the Pockets of Poverty provision must describe the number and, to the extent possible, the types of new jobs (construction and permanent) that will be provided to the low- and moderate-income residents of the Pocket of Poverty as a direct result of the proposed project. If the application calls for job training programs (such as those related to the CETA program) or job recruiting services for the pocket's residents, then such proposed activities must be clearly and fully explained. HUD requires applicants to ensure that at least 75 percent of whatever permanent jobs initially result from the project are provided to low- and moderate-income persons and that at least 51 percent of whatever permanent jobs initially result from the project are provided to low- and moderate-income residents from the pocket. HUD encourages applicants to ensure that at least 20 percent of all permanent jobs are filled by persons from the pocket qualified to participate in the CETA program on a continuous basis. HUD requires all applicants to continuously use best efforts to ensure that at least 75 percent of all permanent jobs resulting from any Action Grant-assisted project are provided to low- and moderate-income persons and that at least 51 percent of all permanent jobs resulting from any Action Grant-assisted project are provided to low- and moderate-income residents from the pocket. The application should clearly describe how the applicant intends to meet initial and continuous job requirements. Private participating parties must meet these employment requirements in the aggregate. To enable the private participants to do so, lease agreements executed by a private participating party shall include:</P>
                <P>(a) Provisions requiring lessees to follow hiring practices that the private participating party has determined will enable it to meet these requirements in the aggregate; and</P>
                <P>(b) Provisions that will enable the private participating party to declare a default under the lease agreement if the lessees do not follow such practices.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This subpart describes policies and procedures applicable to states that have permanently elected to receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for distribution to units of general local government in the state's nonentitlement areas under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (the Act). Other subparts of part 570 are not applicable to the State CDBG program, except as expressly provided otherwise. Regulations of part 570 outside of this subpart that apply to the State CDBG program include §§ 570.200(j) and 570.606.</P>
                <P>(b) HUD's authority for the waiver of regulations and for the suspension of requirements to address damage in a Presidentially-declared disaster area is described in 24 CFR part 5 and in section 122 of the Act, respectively.</P>

                <P>(c) In exercising the Secretary's obligation and responsibility to review a state's performance, the Secretary will give maximum feasible deference to the state's interpretation of the statutory requirements and the requirements of this regulation, provided that these interpretations are not plainly inconsistent with the Act and the Secretary's obligation to enforce compliance with the intent of the Congress as <PRTPAGE P="85"/>declared in the Act. The Secretary will not determine that a state has failed to carry out its certifications in compliance with requirements of the Act (and this regulation) unless the Secretary finds that procedures and requirements adopted by the state are insufficient to afford reasonable assurance that activities undertaken by units of general local government were not plainly inappropriate to meeting the primary objectives of the Act, this regulation, and the state's community development objectives.</P>
                <P>(d) Administrative action taken by the Secretary that is not explicitly and fully part of this regulation shall only apply to a specific case or issue at a specific time, and shall not be generally applicable to the state-administered CDBG program.</P>
                <P>(e) Religious organizations are eligible to participate under the State CDBG Program as provided in § 570.200(j).</P>
                <P>(f) In administering the CDBG program, a state may impose additional or more restrictive provisions on units of general local government participating in the state's program, provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with the Act or other statutory or regulatory provisions that are applicable to the State CDBG program.</P>
                <P>(g) States shall make CDBG program grants only to units of general local government. This restriction does not limit a state's authority to make payments to other parties for state administrative expenses and technical assistance activities authorized in section 106(d) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(h) Any unexpended CDBG origin year grant funds in the United States Treasury account on September 30 of the fifth Federal fiscal year after the end of the origin year grant's period of availability for obligation by HUD will be canceled. HUD may require an earlier expenditure and draw down deadline under a grant agreement.</P>

                <P>(ii) Special assessments to recover the <E T="03">non-CDBG</E> portion may be made, provided that CDBG funds are used to pay the special assessment in behalf of all properties owned and occupied by low and moderate income persons; except that CDBG funds need not be used to pay the special assessments in behalf of properties owned and occupied <PRTPAGE P="86"/>by moderate income persons if, when permitted by the state, the unit of general local government certifies that it does not have sufficient CDBG funds to pay the assessments in behalf of all of the low and moderate income owner-occupant persons. Funds collected through such special assessments are not program income.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Public improvements not initially assisted with CDBG funds.</E> CDBG funds may be used to pay special assessments levied against property when this form of assessment is used to recover the capital cost of eligible public improvements initially financed solely from sources other than CDBG funds. The payment of special assessments with CDBG funds constitutes CDBG assistance to the public improvement. Therefore, CDBG funds may be used to pay special assessments, provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) The installation of the public improvements was carried out in compliance with requirements applicable to activities assisted under this subpart, including labor, environmental and citizen participation requirements;</P>
                <P>(ii) The installation of the public improvement meets a criterion for national objectives. (See § 570.483(b)(1), (c), and (d).)</P>
                <P>(iii) The requirements of § 570.482(b)(1)(ii) are met.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Special eligibility provisions.</E> (1) Microenterprise development activities eligible under section 105(a)(23) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (the Act) may be carried out either through the recipient directly or through public and private organizations, agencies, and other subrecipients (including nonprofit and for-profit subrecipients).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Provision of public services.</E> The following activities shall not be subject to the restrictions on public services under section 105(a)(8) of the Act:</P>
                <P>(i) Support services provided under section 105(a)(23) of the Act, and paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) Services carried out under the provisions of section 105(a)(15) of the Act, that are specifically designed to increase economic opportunities through job training and placement and other employment support services, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Services of any type carried out under the provisions of section 105(a)(15) of the Act pursuant to a strategy approved by a state under the provisions of § 91.315(e)(2) of this title.</P>
                <P>(3) Environmental cleanup and economic development or redevelopment of contaminated properties. Remediation of known or suspected environmental contamination may be undertaken under the authority of section 205 of Public Law 105-276 and section 105(a)(4) of the Act. Economic development activities carried out under sections 105(a)(14), (a)(15), or (a)(17) of the Act may include costs associated with project-specific assessment or remediation of known or suspected environmental contamination.</P>
                <P>(4) Housing counseling, as defined in 24 CFR 5.100, that is funded with or provided in connection with CDBG funds must be carried out in accordance with 24 CFR 5.111.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Broadband infrastructure in housing.</E> Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined by 24 CFR 5.100, of a building with more than 4 rental units, for which CDBG funds are first obligated by the State's grant recipient on or after July 18, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is also defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the State or the State's grant recipient determines and documents the determination that:</P>
                <P>(i) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;</P>
                <P>(ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.</P>
                <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Guidelines and objectives for evaluating project costs and financial requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The following guidelines, also referred to as the underwriting guidelines, are provided to <PRTPAGE P="87"/>assist the recipient to evaluate and select activities to be carried out for economic development purposes. Specifically, these guidelines are applicable to activities that are eligible for CDBG assistance under section 105(a)(17) of the Act, economic development activities eligible under section 105(a)(14) of the Act, and activities that are part of a community economic development project eligible under section 105(a)(15) of the Act. The use of the underwriting guidelines published by HUD is not mandatory. However, states electing not to use these guidelines would be expected to ensure that the state or units of general local government conduct basic financial underwriting prior to the provision of CDBG financial assistance to a for-profit business.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Objectives.</E> The underwriting guidelines are designed to provide the recipient with a framework for financially underwriting and selecting CDBG-assisted economic development projects which are financially viable and will make the most effective use of the CDBG funds. Where appropriate, HUD's underwriting guidelines recognize that different levels of review are appropriate to take into account differences in the size and scope of a proposed project, and in the case of a microenterprise or other small business to take into account the differences in the capacity and level of sophistication among businesses of differing sizes. Recipients are encouraged, when they develop their own programs and underwriting criteria, to also take these factors into account. These underwriting guidelines are published as appendix A to this part. The objectives of the underwriting guidelines are to ensure:</P>
                <P>(i) That project costs are reasonable;</P>
                <P>(ii) That all sources of project financing are committed;</P>
                <P>(iii) That to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are not substituted for non-Federal financial support;</P>
                <P>(iv) That the project is financially feasible;</P>
                <P>(v) That to the extent practicable, the return on the owner's equity investment will not be unreasonably high; and</P>
                <P>(vi) That to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are disbursed on a pro rata basis with other finances provided to the project.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Standards for evaluating public benefit</E>—(1) <E T="03">Purpose and applicability.</E> The grantee is responsible for making sure that at least a minimum level of public benefit is obtained from the expenditure of CDBG funds under the categories of eligibility governed by these standards. The standards set forth below identify the types of public benefit that will be recognized for this purpose and the minimum level of each that must be obtained for the amount of CDBG funds used. These standards are applicable to activities that are eligible for CDBG assistance under section 105(a)(17) of the Act, economic development activities eligible under section 105(a)(14) of the Act, and activities that are part of a community economic development project eligible under section 105(a)(15) of the Act. Certain public facilities and improvements eligible under section 105(a)(2) of the Act, which are undertaken for economic development purposes, are also subject to these standards, as specified in § 570.483(b)(4)(vi)(F)(<E T="03">2</E>). Unlike the guidelines for project costs and financial requirements covered under paragraph (a) of this section, the use of the standards for public benefit is mandatory.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards for activities in the aggregate.</E> Activities covered by these standards must, in the aggregate, either:</P>
                <P>(i) Create or retain at least one full-time equivalent, permanent job per $35,000 of CDBG funds used; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Provide goods or services to residents of an area, such that the number of low- and moderate-income persons residing in the areas served by the assisted businesses amounts to at least one low- and moderate-income person per $350 of CDBG funds used.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Applying the aggregate standards.</E> (i) A state shall apply the aggregate standards under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to all funds distributed for applicable activities from each annual grant. This includes the amount of the annual grant, any funds reallocated by HUD to the state, any program income distributed by the state and any guaranteed loan funds made under the provisions of subpart M of this part covered in the method of distribution in <PRTPAGE P="88"/>the final statement for a given annual grant year.</P>
                <P>(ii) The grantee shall apply the aggregate standards to the number of jobs to be created/retained, or to the number of persons residing in the area served (as applicable), as determined at the time funds are obligated to activities.</P>
                <P>(iii) Where an activity is expected both to create or retain jobs and to provide goods or services to residents of an area, the grantee may elect to count the activity under either the jobs standard or the area residents standard, but not both.</P>
                <P>(iv) Where CDBG assistance for an activity is limited to job training and placement and/or other employment support services, the jobs assisted with CDBG funds shall be considered to be created or retained jobs for the purposes of applying the aggregate standards.</P>
                <P>(v) Any activity subject to these standards which meets one or more of the following criteria may, at the grantee's option, be excluded from the aggregate standards described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section:</P>
                <P>(A) Provides jobs exclusively for unemployed persons or participants in one or more of the following programs:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA);</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Jobs Opportunities for Basic Skills (JOBS); or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC);</P>
                <P>(B) Provides jobs predominantly for residents of Public and Indian Housing units;</P>
                <P>(C) Provides jobs predominantly for homeless persons;</P>
                <P>(D) Provides jobs predominantly for low-skilled, low- and moderate-income persons, where the business agrees to provide clear opportunities for promotion and economic advancement, such as through the provision of training;</P>
                <P>(E) Provides jobs predominantly for persons residing within a census tract (or block numbering area) that has at least 20 percent of its residents who are in poverty;</P>
                <P>(F) Provides assistance to business(es) that operate(s) within a census tract (or block numbering area) that has at least 20 percent of its residents who are in poverty;</P>
                <P>(G) Stabilizes or revitalizes a neighborhood income that has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income;</P>
                <P>(H) Provides assistance to a Community Development Financial Institution (as defined in the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, (12 U.S.C. 4701 note)) serving an area that has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income;</P>
                <P>(I) Provides assistance to an organization eligible to carry out activities under section 105(a)(15) of the Act serving an area that has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income;</P>
                <P>(J) Provides employment opportunities that are an integral component of a project designed to promote spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income and minority persons;</P>
                <P>(K) With prior HUD approval, provides substantial benefit to low-income persons through other innovative approaches;</P>
                <P>(L) Provides services to the residents of an area pursuant to a strategy approved by the State under the provisions of § 91.315(e)(2) of this title;</P>
                <P>(M) Creates or retains jobs through businesses assisted in an area pursuant to a strategy approved by the State under the provisions of § 91.315(e)(2) of this title.</P>
                <P>(N) Directly involves the economic development or redevelopment of environmentally contaminated properties.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Standards for individual activities.</E> Any activity subject to these standards which falls into one or more of the following categories will be considered by HUD to provide insufficient public benefit, and therefore may under no circumstances be assisted with CDBG funds:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount of CDBG assistance exceeds either of the following, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(A) $50,000 per full-time equivalent, permanent job created or retained; or</P>
                <P>(B) $1,000 per low- and moderate-income person to which goods or services are provided by the activity.</P>

                <P>(ii) The activity consists of or includes any of the following:<PRTPAGE P="89"/>
                </P>
                <P>(A) General promotion of the community as a whole (as opposed to the promotion of specific areas and programs);</P>
                <P>(B) Assistance to professional sports teams;</P>
                <P>(C) Assistance to privately-owned recreational facilities that serve a predominantly higher-income clientele, where the recreational benefit to users or members clearly outweighs employment or other benefits to low- and moderate-income persons;</P>
                <P>(D) Acquisition of land for which the specific proposed use has not yet been identified; and</P>
                <P>(E) Assistance to a for-profit business while that business or any other business owned by the same person(s) or entity(ies) is the subject of unresolved findings of noncompliance relating to previous CDBG assistance provided by the recipient.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Applying the individual activity standards.</E> (i) Where an activity is expected both to create or retain jobs and to provide goods or services to residents of an area, it will be disqualified only if the amount of CDBG assistance exceeds both of the amounts in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) The individual activity tests in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section shall be applied to the number of jobs to be created or retained, or to the number of persons residing in the area served (as applicable), as determined at the time funds are obligated to activities.</P>
                <P>(iii) Where CDBG assistance for an activity is limited to job training and placement and/or other employment support services, the jobs assisted with CDBG funds shall be considered to be created or retained jobs for the purposes of applying the individual activity standards in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The state and its grant recipients must maintain sufficient records to demonstrate the level of public benefit, based on the above standards, that is actually achieved upon completion of the CDBG-assisted economic development activity(ies) and how that compares to the level of such benefit anticipated when the CDBG assistance was obligated. If a state grant recipient's actual results show a pattern of substantial variation from anticipated results, the state and its recipient are expected to take those actions reasonably within their respective control to improve the accuracy of the projections. If the actual results demonstrate that the state has failed the public benefit standards, HUD may require the state to meet more stringent standards in future years as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Amendments to economic development projects after review determinations.</E> If, after the grantee enters into a contract to provide assistance to a project, the scope or financial elements of the project change to the extent that a significant contract amendment is appropriate, the project should be reevaluated under these and the recipient's guidelines. (This would include, for example, situations where the business requests a change in the amount or terms of assistance being provided, or an extension to the loan payment period required in the contract.) If a reevaluation of the project indicates that the financial elements and public benefit to be derived have also substantially changed, then the recipient should make appropriate adjustments in the amount, type, terms or conditions of CDBG assistance which has been offered, to reflect the impact of the substantial change. (For example, if a change in the project elements results in a substantial reduction of the total project costs, it may be appropriate for the recipient to reduce the amount of total CDBG assistance.) If the amount of CDBG assistance provided to the project is increased, the amended project must still comply with the public benefit standards under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Prohibition on use of assistance for employment relocation activities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> CDBG funds may not be used to directly assist a business, including a business expansion, in the relocation of a plant, facility, or operation from one labor market area (LMA) to another LMA if the relocation is likely to result in a significant loss of jobs in the LMA from which the relocation occurs.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to the section:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Directly assist.</E> Directly assist means the provision of CDBG funds to a business pursuant to section <PRTPAGE P="90"/>105(a)(15) or (17) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 <E T="03">et seq</E>). Direct assistance also includes assistance under section 105(a)(1), (2), (4), (7), and (14) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, when the state's grantee, subrecipient, or nonprofit entity eligible under section 105(a)(15) enters into an agreement with a business to undertake one or more of these activities as a condition of the business relocating a facility, plant, or operation to the LMA. Provision of public facilities and indirect assistance that will provide benefit to multiple businesses does not fall under the definition of “directly assist,” unless it includes the provision of infrastructure to aid a specific business that is the subject of an agreement with the specific assisted business.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Labor market area (LMA).</E> For metropolitan areas, an LMA is an area defined as such by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). An LMA is an economically integrated geographic area within which individuals can live and find employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change employment without changing their place of residence. In addition, LMAs are nonoverlapping and geographically exhaustive. For metropolitan areas, grantees must use employment data, as defined by the BLS, for the LMA in which the affected business is currently located and from which current jobs may be lost. For non-metropolitan areas, grantees must use employment data, as defined by the BLS, for the LMA in which the assisted business is currently located and from which current jobs may be lost. For non-metropolitan areas, a LMA is either an area defined by the BLS as an LMA, or a state may choose to combine non-metropolitan LMAs. States are required to define or reaffirm prior definitions of their LMAs on an annual basis and retain records to substantiate such areas prior to any business relocation that would be impacted by this rule. Metropolitan LMAs cannot be combined, nor can a non-metropolitan LMA be combined with a metropolitan LMA. For the Insular Areas, each jurisdiction will be considered to be an LMA. For the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, each of the three participating counties in Hawaii will be considered to be its own LMA. Recipients of Fiscal Year 1999 Small Cities Program funding in New York will follow the requirements for State CDBG recipients.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Operation.</E> A business operation includes, but is not limited to, any equipment, employment opportunity, production capacity, or product line of the business.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Significant loss of jobs.</E> (A) A loss of jobs is significant if: The number of jobs to be lost in the LMA in which the affected business is currently located is equal to or greater than one-tenth of one percent of the total number of persons in the labor force of that LMA; or in all cases, a loss of 500 or more jobs. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, a loss of 25 jobs or fewer does not constitute a significant loss of jobs.</P>
                <P>(B) A job is considered to be lost due to the provision of CDBG assistance if the job is relocated within three years from the date the assistance is provided to the business or the time period within which jobs are to be created as specified by the agreement among the business, the recipient, and the state (as applicable) if it is longer than three years.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Written agreement.</E> Before directly assisting a business with CDBG funds, the recipient, subrecipient, or (in the case of any activity carried out pursuant to 105(a)(15)) nonprofit entity shall sign a written agreement with the assisted business. The written agreement shall include:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Statement.</E> A statement from the assisted business as to whether the assisted activity will result in the relocation of any industrial or commercial plant, facility, or operation from one LMA to another and, if so, the number of jobs that will be relocated from each LMA;</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Required certification.</E> If the assistance will not result in a relocation covered by this section, a certification from the assisted business that neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries, has plans to relocate jobs at the time the agreement is signed that would result in a significant job loss as defined in this rule; and<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Reimbursement of assistance.</E> The agreement shall provide for reimbursement to the recipient of any assistance provided to, or expended on behalf of, the business in the event that assistance results in a relocation prohibited under this section.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Assistance not covered by this paragraph.</E> This paragraph does not apply to:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Relocation assistance.</E> Relocation assistance required by the Uniform Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA), (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655); optional relocation assistance under section 105(a)(11), as implemented at 570.606(d);</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Microenterprises.</E> Assistance to microenterprises as defined by section 102(a)(22) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974; and</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Arms-length transactions.</E> Assistance to a business that purchases business equipment, inventory, or other physical assets in an arms-length transaction, including the assets of an existing business, provided that the purchase does not result in the relocation of the sellers' business operation (including customer base or list, goodwill, product lines, or trade names) from one LMA to another LMA and does not produce a significant loss of jobs in the LMA from which the relocation occurs.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 570.483</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Criteria for national objectives.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The following criteria shall be used to determine whether a CDBG assisted activity complies with one or more of the national objectives as required to section 104(b)(3) of the Act. (HUD is willing to consider a waiver of these requirements in accordance with § 570.480(b)).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Activities benefiting low and moderate income persons.</E> An activity will be considered to address the objective of benefiting low and moderate income persons if it meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. In assessing any such evidence, the full range of direct effects of the assisted activity will be considered. The activities, when taken as a whole, must not benefit moderate income persons to the exclusion of low income persons:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Area benefit activities.</E> (i) An activity, the benefits of which are available to all the residents in a particular area, where at least 51 percent of the residents are low and moderate income persons. Such an area need not be coterminous with census tracts or other officially recognized boundaries but must be the entire area served by the activity. Units of general local government may, at the discretion of the state, use either HUD-provided data comparing census data with appropriate low and moderate income levels or survey data that is methodologically sound. An activity that serves an area that is not primarily residential in character shall not qualify under this criterion.</P>
                <P>(ii) An activity, where the assistance is to a public improvement that provides benefits to all the residents of an area, that is limited to paying special assessments levied against residential properties owned and occupied by persons of low and moderate income.</P>
                <P>(iii)(A) An activity to develop, establish and operate (not to exceed two years after establishment), a uniform emergency telephone number system serving an area having less than 51 percent of low and moderate income residents, when the system has not been made operational before the receipt of CDBG funds, provided a prior written determination is obtained from HUD. HUD's determination will be based upon certifications by the State that:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The system will contribute significantly to the safety of the residents of the area. The unit of general local government must provide the state a list of jurisdictions and unincorporated areas to be served by the system and a list of the emergency services that will participate in the emergency telephone number system;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) At least 51 percent of the use of the system will be by low and moderate income persons. The state's certification may be based upon information which identifies the total number of <PRTPAGE P="92"/>calls actually received over the preceding twelve-month period for each of the emergency services to be covered by the emergency telephone number system and relates those calls to the geographic segment (expressed as nearly as possible in terms of census tracts, enumeration districts, block groups, or combinations thereof that are contained within the segment) of the service area from which the calls were generated. In analyzing this data to meet the requirements of this section, the state will assume that the distribution of income among callers generally reflects the income characteristics of the general population residing in the same geographic area where the callers reside. Alternatively, the state's certification may be based upon other data, agreed to by HUD and the state, which shows that over the preceding twelve-month period the users of all the services to be included in the emergency telephone number system consisted of at least 51 percent low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Other federal funds received by the unit of general local government are insufficient or unavailable for a uniform emergency telephone number system. The unit of general local government must submit a statement explaining whether the problem is caused by the insufficiency of the amount of such funds, the restrictions on the use of such funds, or the prior commitment of such funds for other purposes by the unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The percentage of the total costs of the system paid for by CDBG funds does not exceed the percentage of low and moderate income persons in the service area of the system. The unit of general local government must include a description of the boundaries of the service area of the system; the census tracts or enumeration districts within the boundaries; the total number of persons and the total number of low and moderate income persons in each census tract or enumeration district, and the percentage of low and moderate income persons in the service area; and the total cost of the system.</P>
                <P>(B) The certifications of the state must be submitted along with a brief statement describing the factual basis upon which the certifications were made.</P>
                <P>(iv) Activities meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section may be considered to qualify under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(v) HUD will consider activities meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section to qualify under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, provided that the area covered by the strategy meets one of the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(A) The area is in a Federally-designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community;</P>
                <P>(B) The area is primarily residential and contains a percentage of low and moderate income residents that is no less than 70 percent;</P>
                <P>(C) All of the census tracts (or block numbering areas) in the area have poverty rates of at least 20 percent, at least 90 percent of the census tracts (or block numbering areas) in the area have poverty rates of at least 25 percent, and the area is primarily residential. (If only part of a census tract or block numbering area is included in a strategy area, the poverty rate shall be computed for those block groups (or any part thereof) which are included in the strategy area.)</P>
                <P>(D) Upon request by the State, HUD may grant exceptions to the 70 percent low and moderate income or 25 percent poverty minimum thresholds on a case-by-case basis. In no case, however, may a strategy area have both a percentage of low and moderate income residents less than 51 percent and a poverty rate less than 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Limited clientele activities.</E> (i) An activity which benefits a limited clientele, at least 51 percent of whom are low and moderate income persons. The following kinds of activities may not qualify under paragraph (b)(2) of this section:</P>
                <P>(A) Activities, the benefits of which are available to all the residents of an area;</P>
                <P>(B) Activities involving the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of property for housing; or</P>

                <P>(C) Activities where the benefit to low- and moderate-income persons to <PRTPAGE P="93"/>be considered is the creation or retention of jobs, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) To qualify under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the activity must meet one or the following tests:</P>
                <P>(A) It must benefit a clientele who are generally presumed to be principally low and moderate income persons. Activities that exclusively serve a group of persons in any one or a combination of the following categories may be presumed to benefit persons, 51 percent of whom are low and moderate income: abused children, battered spouses, elderly persons, adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled,” homeless persons, illiterate adults, persons living with AIDS, and migrant farm workers; or</P>
                <P>(B) It must require information on family size and income so that it is evident that at least 51 percent of the clientele are persons whose family income does not exceed the low and moderate income limit; or</P>
                <P>(C) It must have income eligibility requirements which limit the activity exclusively to low and moderate income persons; or</P>
                <P>(D) It must be of such a nature, and be in such a location, that it may be concluded that the activity's clientele will primarily be low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(iii) An activity that serves to remove material or architectural barriers to the mobility or accessibility of elderly persons or of adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled” will be presumed to qualify under this criterion if it is restricted, to the extent practicable, to the removal of such barriers by assisting:</P>
                <P>(A) The reconstruction of a public facility or improvement, or portion thereof, that does not qualify under § 570.483(b)(1);</P>
                <P>(B) The rehabilitation of a privately owned nonresidential building or improvement that does not qualify under § 570.483(b) (1) or (4); or</P>
                <P>(C) The rehabilitation of the common areas of a residential structure that contains more than one dwelling unit and that does not qualify under § 570.483(b)(3).</P>
                <P>(iv) A microenterprise assistance activity (carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 105(a)(23) of the Act or § 570.482(c) and limited to microenterprises) with respect to those owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises assisted under the activity who are low- and moderate-income persons. For purposes of this paragraph, persons determined to be low and moderate income may be presumed to continue to qualify as such for up to a three-year period.</P>
                <P>(v) An activity designed to provide job training and placement and/or other employment support services, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services, in which the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons assisted is less than 51 percent may qualify under this paragraph in the following limited circumstances:</P>
                <P>(A) In such cases where such training or provision of supportive services is an integrally-related component of a larger project, the only use of CDBG assistance for the project is to provide the job training and/or supportive services; and</P>
                <P>(B) The proportion of the total cost of the project borne by CDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of the total number of persons assisted who are low or moderate income.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Housing activities.</E> An eligible activity carried out for the purpose of providing or improving permanent residential structures that, upon completion, will be occupied by low and moderate income households. This would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the acquisition or rehabilitation of property by the unit of general local government, a subrecipient, an entity eligible to receive assistance under section 105(a)(15) of the Act, a developer, an individual homebuyer, or an individual homeowner; conversion of nonresidential structures; and new housing construction. If the structure contains two dwelling units, at least one must be so occupied, and if the structure contains more than two dwelling units, at least 51 percent of the units must be so occupied. If two or more rental buildings being assisted are or will be located on the same or contiguous <PRTPAGE P="94"/>properties, and the buildings will be under common ownership and management, the grouped buildings may be considered for this purpose as a single structure. If housing activities being assisted meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(ii) or (e)(5)(ii) of this section, all such housing may also be considered for this purpose as a single structure. For rental housing, occupancy by low and moderate income households must be at affordable rents to qualify under this criterion. The unit of general local government shall adopt and make public its standards for determining “affordable rents” for this purpose. The following shall also qualify under this criterion:</P>
                <P>(i) When less than 51 percent of the units in a structure will be occupied by low and moderate income households, CDBG assistance may be provided in the following limited circumstances:</P>
                <P>(A) The assistance is for an eligible activity to reduce the development cost of the new construction of a multifamily, non-elderly rental housing project; and</P>
                <P>(B) Not less than 20 percent of the units will be occupied by low and moderate income households at affordable rents; and</P>
                <P>(C) The proportion of the total cost of developing the project to be borne by CDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of units in the project that will be occupied by low and moderate income households.</P>
                <P>(ii) Where CDBG funds are used to assist rehabilitation delivery services or in direct support of the unit of general local government's Rental Rehabilitation Program authorized under 24 CFR part 511, the funds shall be considered to benefit low and moderate income persons where not less than 51 percent of the units assisted, or to be assisted, by the Rental Rehabilitation Program overall are for low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(iii) When CDBG funds are used for housing services eligible under section 105(a)(21) of the Act, such funds shall be considered to benefit low and moderate income persons if the housing units for which the services are provided are HOME-assisted and the requirements of § 92.252 or § 92.254 of this title are met.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Job creation or retention activities.</E> (i) An activity designed to create permanent jobs where at least 51 percent of the jobs, computed on a full time equivalent basis, involve the employment of low and moderate income persons. For an activity that creates jobs, the unit of general local government must document that at least 51 percent of the jobs will be held by, or will be made available to low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(ii) For an activity that retains jobs, the unit of general local government must document that the jobs would actually be lost without the CDBG assistance and that either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to at least 51 percent of the jobs at the time the CDBG assistance is provided: The job is known to be held by a low or moderate income person; or the job can reasonably be expected to turn over within the following two years and that it will be filled by, or that steps will be taken to ensure that it is made available to, a low or moderate income person upon turnover.</P>
                <P>(iii) Jobs will be considered to be available to low and moderate income persons for these purposes only if:</P>
                <P>(A) Special skills that can only be acquired with substantial training or work experience or education beyond high school are not a prerequisite to fill such jobs, or the business agrees to hire unqualified persons and provide training; and</P>
                <P>(B) The unit of general local government and the assisted business take actions to ensure that low and moderate income persons receive first consideration for filling such jobs.</P>
                <P>(iv) For purposes of determining whether a job is held by or made available to a low- or moderate-income person, the person may be presumed to be a low- or moderate-income person if:</P>
                <P>(A) He/she resides within a census tract (or block numbering area) that either:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Has at least 70 percent of its residents who are low- and moderate-income persons; or<PRTPAGE P="95"/>
                </P>
                <P>(B) The assisted business is located within a census tract (or block numbering area) that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section and the job under consideration is to be located within that census tract.</P>

                <P>(v) A census tract (or block numbering area) qualifies for the presumptions permitted under paragraphs (b)(4)(iv) (A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (B) of this section if it is either part of a Federally-designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community or meets the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(A) It has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as determined by the most recently available decennial census information;</P>
                <P>(B) It does not include any portion of a central business district, as this term is used in the most recent Census of Retail Trade, unless the tract has a poverty rate of at least 30 percent as determined by the most recently available decennial census information; and</P>
                <P>(C) It evidences pervasive poverty and general distress by meeting at least one of the following standards:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) All block groups in the census tract have poverty rates of at least 20 percent;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The specific activity being undertaken is located in a block group that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD determines that the census tract exhibits other objectively determinable signs of general distress such as high incidence of crime, narcotics use, homelessness, abandoned housing, and deteriorated infrastructure or substantial population decline.</P>
                <P>(vi) As a general rule, each assisted business shall be considered to be a separate activity for purposes of determining whether the activity qualifies under this paragraph, except:</P>
                <P>(A) In certain cases such as where CDBG funds are used to acquire, develop or improve a real property (e.g., a business incubator or an industrial park) the requirement may be met by measuring jobs in the aggregate for all the businesses that locate on the property, provided the businesses are not otherwise assisted by CDBG funds.</P>
                <P>(B) Where CDBG funds are used to pay for the staff and overhead costs of an entity specified in section 105(a)(15) of the Act making loans to businesses exclusively from non-CDBG funds, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created by all of the businesses receiving loans during any one-year period.</P>
                <P>(C) Where CDBG funds are used by a recipient or subrecipient to provide technical assistance to businesses, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all of the businesses receiving technical assistance during any one-year period.</P>
                <P>(D) Where CDBG funds are used for activities meeting the criteria listed at § 570.482(f)(3)(v), this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all businesses for which CDBG assistance is obligated for such activities during any one-year period, except as provided at paragraph (e)(6) of this section.</P>
                <P>(E) Where CDBG funds are used by a Community Development Financial Institution to carry out activities for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all businesses for which CDBG assistance is obligated for such activities during any one-year period, except as provided at paragraph (e)(6) of this section.</P>
                <P>(F) Where CDBG funds are used for public facilities or improvements which will result in the creation or retention of jobs by more than one business, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained by all such businesses as a result of the public facility or improvement.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Where the public facility or improvement is undertaken principally for the benefit of one or more particular businesses, but where other businesses might also benefit from the assisted activity, the requirement may be met by aggregating only the jobs created or retained by those businesses for which the facility/improvement is principally undertaken, provided that the cost (in CDBG funds) for the facility/improvement is less than $10,000 per permanent full-time equivalent job to be created or retained by those businesses.<PRTPAGE P="96"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In any case where the cost per job to be created or retained (as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(F)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section) is $10,000 or more, the requirement must be met by aggregating the jobs created or retained as a result of the public facility or improvement by all businesses in the service area of the facility/improvement. This aggregation must include businesses which, as a result of the public facility/improvement, locate or expand in the service area of the public facility/improvement between the date the state awards the CDBG funds to the recipient and the date one year after the physical completion of the public facility/improvement. In addition, the assisted activity must comply with the public benefit standards at § 570.482(f).</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Planning-only activities.</E> An activity involving planning (when such activity is the only activity for which the grant to the unit of general local government is given, or if the planning activity is unrelated to any other activity assisted by the grant) if it can be documented that at least 51 percent of the persons who would benefit from implementation of the plan are low and moderate income persons. Any such planning activity for an area or a community composed of persons of whom at least 51 percent are low and moderate income shall be considered to meet this national objective.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Activities which aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight.</E> Activities meeting one or more of the following criteria, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, will be considered to aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Activities to address slums or blight on an area basis.</E> An activity will be considered to address prevention or elimination of slums or blight in an area if the state can determine that:</P>
                <P>(i) The area, delineated by the unit of general local government, meets a definition of a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area under state or local law;</P>
                <P>(ii) The area also meets the conditions in either paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) or(c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
                <P>(A) At least 25 percent of properties throughout the area experience one or more of the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Physical deterioration of buildings or improvements;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Abandonment of properties;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Chronic high occupancy turnover rates or chronic high vacancy rates in commercial or industrial buildings;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Significant declines in property values or abnormally low property values relative to other areas in the community; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Known or suspected environmental contamination.</P>
                <P>(B) The public improvements throughout the area are in a general state of deterioration.</P>
                <P>(iii) The assisted activity addresses one or more of the conditions which contributed to the deterioration of the area. Rehabilitation of residential buildings carried out in an area meeting the above requirements will be considered to address the area's deterioration only where each such building rehabilitated is considered substandard before rehabilitation, and all deficiencies making a building substandard have been eliminated if less critical work on the building is also undertaken. The State shall ensure that the unit of general local government has developed minimum standards for building quality which may take into account local conditions.</P>
                <P>(iv) The state keeps records sufficient to document its findings that a project meets the national objective of prevention or elimination of slums and blight. The state must establish definitions of the conditions listed at § 570.483(c)(1)(ii)(A) and maintain records to substantiate how the area met the slums or blighted criteria. The designation of an area as slum or blighted under this section is required to be redetermined every 10 years for continued qualification. Documentation must be retained pursuant to the recordkeeping requirements contained at § 570.490.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Activities to address slums or blight on a spot basis.</E> The following activities can be undertaken on a spot basis to eliminate specific conditions of blight, physical decay, or environmental contamination that are not located in a slum or blighted area: Acquisition; clearance; relocation; historic preservation; remediation of environmentally contaminated properties; or <PRTPAGE P="97"/>rehabilitation of buildings or improvements. However, rehabilitation must be limited to eliminating those conditions that are detrimental to public health and safety. If acquisition or relocation is undertaken, it must be a precursor to another eligible activity (funded with CDBG or other resources) that directly eliminates the specific conditions of blight or physical decay, or environmental contamination.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Planning only activities.</E> An activity involving planning (when the activity is the only activity for which the grant to the unit of general local government is given, or the planning activity is unrelated to any other activity assisted by the grant) if the plans are for a slum or blighted area, or if all elements of the planning are necessary for and related to an activity which, if funded, would meet one of the other criteria of elimination of slums or blight.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Activities designed to meet community development needs having a particular urgency.</E> In the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, an activity will be considered to address this objective if the unit of general local government certifies, and the state determines, that the activity is designed to alleviate existing conditions which pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community which are of recent origin or which recently became urgent, that the unit of general local government is unable to finance the activity on its own, and that other sources of funding are not available. A condition will generally be considered to be of recent origin if it developed or became urgent within 18 months preceding the certification by the unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional criteria.</E> (1) In any case where the activity undertaken is a public improvement and the activity is clearly designed to serve a primarily residential area, the activity must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section whether or not the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are met in order to qualify as benefiting low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(2) Where the assisted activity is acquisition of real property, a preliminary determination of whether the activity addresses a national objective may be based on the planned use of the property after acquisition. A final determination shall be based on the actual use of the property, excluding any short-term, temporary use. Where the acquisition is for the purpose of clearance which will eliminate specific conditions of blight or physical decay, the clearance activity shall be considered the actual use of the property. However, any subsequent use or disposition of the cleared property shall be treated as a “change of use” under § 570.489(j).</P>
                <P>(3) Where the assisted activity is relocation assistance that the unit of general local government is required to provide, the relocation assistance shall be considered to address the same national objective as is addressed by the displacing activity. Where the relocation assistance is voluntary, the unit of general local government may qualify the assistance either on the basis of the national objective addressed by the displacing activity or, if the relocation assistance is to low and moderate income persons, on the basis of the national objective of benefiting low and moderate income persons.</P>
                <P>(4) Where CDBG-assisted activities are carried out by a Community Development Financial Institution whose charter limits its investment area to a primarily residential area consisting of at least 51 percent low- and moderate-income persons, the unit of general local government may also elect the following options:</P>
                <P>(i) Activities carried out by the Community Development Financial Institution for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs may, at the option of the unit of general local government, be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph under the criteria at paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section in lieu of the criteria at paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</P>

                <P>(ii) All housing activities for which the Community Development Financial Institution obligates CDBG assistance during any one-year period may be considered to be a single structure for purposes of applying the criteria at paragraph (b)(3) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="98"/>
                </P>
                <P>(5) If the unit of general local government has elected to prepare a community revitalization strategy pursuant to the authority of § 91.315(e)(2) of this title, and the State has approved the strategy, the unit of general local government may also elect the following options:</P>
                <P>(i) Activities undertaken pursuant to the strategy for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs may, at the option of the grantee, be considered to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section under the criteria at § 570.483(b)(1)(v) instead of the criteria at § 570.483(b)(4); and</P>
                <P>(ii) All housing activities in the area undertaken pursuant to the strategy may be considered to be a single structure for purposes of applying the criteria at paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) If an activity meeting the criteria in § 570.482(f)(3)(v) also meets the requirements of either paragraph (e)(4)(i) or (e)(5)(i) of this section, the unit of general local government may elect to qualify the activity either under the area benefit criteria at paragraph (b)(1)(iv) or (v) of this section or under the job aggregation criteria at paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D) of this section, but not under both. Where an activity may meet the job aggregation criteria at both paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of this section, the unit of general local government may elect to qualify the activity under either criterion, but not both.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Planning and administrative costs.</E> CDBG funds expended for eligible planning and administrative costs by units of general local government in conjunction with other CDBG assisted activities will be considered to address the national objectives.</P>

No CDBG funds may be included in more than one period selected, and all CDBG funds received must be included in a selected period.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of 70 percent benefit.</E> Determination that a state has carried out its certification under paragraph (a) of this section requires evidence that not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of the designated annual grant(s), any funds reallocated by HUD to the state, any distributed program income and any guaranteed loan funds under the provisions of subpart M of this part covered in the method of distribution in the final statement or statements for the designated annual grant year or years have been expended for activities meeting criteria as provided in § 570.483(b) for activities benefiting low and moderate income persons. In calculating the percentage of funds expended for such activities:</P>
                <P>(1) All CDBG funds included in the period selected and certified to by the state shall be accounted for, except for funds used by the State, or by the units of general local government, for program administration, or for planning activities other than those which must meet a national objective under § 570.483 (b)(5) or (c)(3).</P>
                <P>(2) Any funds expended by a state for the purpose of repayment of loans guaranteed under the provisions of subpart M of this part shall be excepted from inclusion in this calculation.</P>
                <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, CDBG funds expended for an eligible activity meeting the criteria for activities benefiting low and moderate income persons shall count in their entirety towards meeting the 70 percent benefit to persons of low and moderate income requirement.</P>

                <P>(4) Funds expended for the acquisition, new construction or rehabilitation of property for housing that qualifies under § 570.483(b)(3) shall be counted for this purpose, but shall be limited to an amount determined by multiplying the total cost (including CDBG <PRTPAGE P="99"/>and non-CDBG costs) of the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation by the percent of units in such housing to be occupied by low and moderate income persons, except that the amount counted shall not exceed the amount of CDBG funds provided.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Required submissions.</E> In order to receive its annual CDBG grant under this subpart, a State must submit a consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR part 91. That part includes requirements for the content of the consolidated plan, for the process of developing the plan, including citizen participation provisions, for the submission date, for HUD approval, and for the amendment process.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to make submission.</E> The state's failure to make the submission required by paragraph (a) of this section within the prescribed deadline constitutes the state's election not to receive and distribute amounts allocated for its nonentitlement areas for the applicable fiscal year. Funds will be either:</P>
                <P>(1) Administered by HUD pursuant to subpart F of this part if the state has not administered the program in any previous fiscal year; or</P>
                <P>(2) Reallocated to all states in the succeeding fiscal year according to the formula of section 106(d) of the Act, if the state administered the program in any previous year.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval of grant.</E> HUD will approve a grant if the State's submissions have been made and approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 91, and the certifications required therein are satisfactory to the Secretary. The certifications will be satisfactory to the Secretary for this purpose unless the Secretary has determined pursuant to § 570.493 that the State has not complied with the requirements of this subpart, or has determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the State's past performance under this program, that tends to challenge in a substantial manner the State's certification of future performance. If the Secretary makes any such determination, however, the State may be required to submit further assurances as the Secretary may deem warranted or necessary to find the grantee's certification satisfactory.</P>

                <P>(1) Provide for and encourage citizen participation, particularly by low and moderate income persons who reside in slum or blighted areas and areas in which CDBG funds are proposed to be used;</P>
                <P>(2) Ensure that residents will be given reasonable and timely access to local meetings, consistent with accessibility and reasonable accommodation requirements in accordance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the regulations at 24 CFR part 8, and the Americans with Disabilities Act and the regulations at 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, as applicable, as well as information and records relating to the unit of local government's proposed and actual use of CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(3) Furnish citizens information, including but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount of CDBG funds expected to be made available for the current fiscal year (including the grant and anticipated program income);</P>
                <P>(ii) The range of activities that may be undertaken with the CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(iii) The estimated amount of the CDBG funds proposed to be used for activities that will meet the national objective of benefit to low and moderate income persons; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The proposed CDBG activities likely to result in displacement and the unit of general local government's antidisplacement and relocation plans required under § 570.488.</P>

                <P>(4) Provide technical assistance to groups that are representative of persons of low- and moderate-income that <PRTPAGE P="100"/>request assistance in developing proposals (including proposed strategies and actions to affirmatively further fair housing) in accordance with the procedures developed by the State. Such assistance need not include providing funds to such groups;</P>
                <P>(5) Provide for a minimum of two public hearings, each at a different stage of the program, for the purpose of obtaining residents' views and responding to proposals and questions. Together the hearings must cover community development and housing needs (including affirmatively furthering fair housing), development of proposed activities, and a review of program performance. The public hearings to cover community development and housing needs must be held before submission of an application to the State. There must be reasonable notice of the hearings and they must be held at times and accessible locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with accommodations for persons with disabilities. Public hearings shall be conducted in a manner to meet the needs of non-English speaking residents where a significant number of non-English speaking residents can reasonably be expected to participate;</P>
                <P>(6) Provide citizens with reasonable advance notice of, and opportunity to comment on, proposed activities in an application to the state and, for grants already made, activities which are proposed to be added, deleted or substantially changed from the unit of general local government's application to the state. Substantially changed means changes made in terms of purpose, scope, location or beneficiaries as defined by criteria established by the state.</P>
                <P>(7) Provide citizens the address, phone number, and times for submitting complaints and grievances, and provide timely written answers to written complaints and grievances, within 15 working days where practicable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Activities serving beneficiaries outside the jurisdiction of the unit of general local government.</E> Any activity carried out by a recipient of State CDBG program funds must significantly benefit residents of the jurisdiction of the grant recipient, and the unit of general local government must determine that the activity is meeting its needs in accordance with section 106(d)(2)(D) of the Act. For an activity to significantly benefit residents of the recipient jurisdiction, the CDBG funds expended by the unit of general local government must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the benefits to its residents.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Activities located in Entitlement jurisdictions.</E> Any activity carried out by a recipient of State CDBG program funds in entitlement jurisdictions must significantly benefit residents of the jurisdiction of the grant recipient, and the State CDBG recipient must determine that the activity is meeting its needs in accordance with section 106(d)(2)(D) of the Act. For an activity to significantly benefit residents of the recipient jurisdiction, the CDBG funds expended by the unit of general local government must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the benefits to its residents. In addition, the grant cannot be used to provide a significant benefit to the entitlement jurisdiction unless the entitlement grantee provides a meaningful contribution to the project.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative and planning costs.</E>—(1) <E T="03">State administrative and technical assistance costs.</E> (i) The State is responsible for the administration of all CDBG funds. The State may use CDBG funds not to exceed $100,000, plus 50 percent of administrative expenses incurred in excess of $100,000. Amounts of CDBG funds used to pay administrative expenses in excess of $100,000 shall not, subject to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, exceed the sum of 3 percent of the State's annual grant; 3 percent of program income received by units of general local government during each program year, regardless of the origin year in which the State grant funds that generate the program income were appropriated (whether retained by units of general local government or paid to the State); and 3 percent of funds reallocated by HUD to the State.</P>

                <P>(ii) To pay the costs of providing technical assistance to local governments and nonprofit program recipients, a State may, subject to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, use CDBG funds received on or after January 23, <PRTPAGE P="102"/>2004, in an amount not to exceed the sum of 3 percent of its annual grant; 3 percent of program income received by units of general local government during each program year, regardless of the origin year in which the State grant funds that generate the program income were appropriated (whether retained by units of general local government or paid to the State); and 3 percent of funds reallocated by HUD to the State during each program year.</P>
                <P>(iii) The amount of CDBG funds used to pay the sum of administrative costs in excess of $100,000 paid pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and technical assistance costs paid pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section must not exceed the sum of 3 percent of the State's annual grant; 3 percent of program income received by units of general local government during each program year, regardless of the origin year in which the State grant funds that generate the program income were appropriated (whether retained by the unit of general local government or paid to the State); and 3 percent of funds reallocated by HUD to the State.</P>
                <P>(iv) In calculating the amount of CDBG funds that may be used to pay State administrative expenses prior to January 23, 2004, the State may include in the calculation the following elements only to the extent that they are within the following time limitations:</P>
                <P>(A) $100,000 per annual grant beginning with FY 1984 allocations;</P>
                <P>(B) Two percent of the sum of a State's annual grant and funds reallocated by HUD to the State within a program year, without limitation based on when such amounts were received;</P>
                <P>(C) Two percent of program income returned by units of general local government to States after August 21, 1985; and</P>
                <P>(D) Two percent of program income received and retained by units of general local government after February 11, 1991.</P>
                <P>(v) In regard to its administrative costs, for grants before origin year 2015, the State has the option of selecting its approach for demonstrating compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For grants beginning with origin year 2015 grants and subsequent grants, the State must use the approach in paragraph (a)(1)(v)(A) of this section. Any State whose matching cost contributions toward State administrative expense matching requirements are in arrears must bring matching cost contributions up to the level of CDBG funds expended for such costs. A State grant may not be closed out if the State's matching cost contribution is not at least equal to the amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 expended for administration. The two approaches for demonstrating compliance with this paragraph (a)(1) are:</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Year-to-year tracking and limitation on drawdown of funds.</E> The State will calculate the maximum allowable amount of CDBG funds that may be used for State administrative expenses from the sum of each origin year grant, program income received during that associated program year and reallocations by HUD to the State during that associated program year. The State will draw down amounts of those funds only upon its own expenditure of an equal or greater amount of matching funds from its own resources after the expenditure of the initial $100,000 for State administrative expenses. The State will be considered to be in compliance with the applicable requirements if the actual amount of CDBG funds spent on State administrative expenses does not exceed the maximum allowable amount, and if the amount of matching funds that the State has expended for that grant year is equal to or greater than the amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 spent during that same grant year. Under this approach, the State must demonstrate that it has paid from its own funds at least 50 percent of its administrative expenses in excess of $100,000 by the closeout of each grant.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Cumulative accounting of administrative costs incurred by the State since its assumption of the CDBG program for grants before origin year 2015.</E> Under this approach, the State will identify, for each grant it has received, the CDBG funds eligible to be used for State administrative expenses, as well as the minimum amount of matching funds <PRTPAGE P="103"/>that the State is required to contribute. The amounts will then be aggregated for all grants received. The State must keep records demonstrating the actual amount of CDBG funds from each grant received that was used for State administrative expenses, as well as matching amounts that were contributed by the State. The State will be considered to be in compliance with the applicable requirements if the aggregate of the actual amounts of CDBG funds spent on State administrative expenses does not exceed the aggregate maximum allowable amount and if the aggregate amount of matching funds that the State has expended is equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 (for each annual grant within the subject period) spent on administrative expenses during its 3- to 5-year Consolidated Planning period. If the State grant for any grant year within the 3- to 5-year period has been closed out, the aggregate amount of CDBG funds spent on State administrative expenses, the aggregate maximum allowable amount, the aggregate matching funds expended, and the aggregate amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 (for each annual grant within the subject period) will be reduced by amounts attributable to the grant year for which the State grant has been closed out.</P>
                <P>(2) The State may not charge fees of any entity for processing or considering any application for CDBG funds, or for carrying out its responsibilities under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Administrative costs are those described at § 570.489(a)(1) for States and, for units of general local government, are those described at sections 105(a)(12) and (a)(13) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(ii) The combined expenditures by the State and its funded units of general local government for planning, management, and administrative costs shall not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate amount of the origin year grant, any origin year grant funds reallocated by HUD to the State, and the amount of any program income received during the program year.</P>
                <P>(iii) For origin year 2015 grants and subsequent grants, no more than 20 percent of any annual grant (excluding program income) shall be expended by the State and its funded units of general local government for planning, management, and administrative costs. In addition, the combined expenditures by the States and its unit of general local government for planning, management, and administrative costs shall not exceed 20 percent of any origin year grant funds reallocated by HUD to the State.</P>
                <P>(iv) Funds from a grant of any origin year may be used to pay planning and program administrative costs associated with any grant of any origin year.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reimbursement of pre-agreement costs.</E> The State may permit, in accordance with such procedures as the State may establish, a unit of general local government to incur costs for CDBG activities before the establishment of a formal grant relationship between the State and the unit of general local government and to charge these pre-agreement costs to the grant, provided that the activities are eligible and undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this part and 24 CFR part 58. A State may incur costs prior to entering into a grant agreement with HUD and charge those pre-agreement costs to the grant, provided that the activities are eligible and are undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this part, part 58 of this title, and the citizen participation requirements of part 91 of this title.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal grant payments.</E> The State's requests for payment, and the Federal Government's payments upon such requests, must comply with 31 CFR part 205. The State must use procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of grant funds and disbursement of funds by the State to units of general local government. States must also have procedures in place, and units of general local government must use these procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds by the State and disbursement for CDBG activities.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Fiscal controls and accounting procedures.</E> (1) A State shall have fiscal and administrative requirements for expending and accounting for all funds received under this subpart. These requirements must be available for Federal inspection and must:<PRTPAGE P="104"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Be sufficiently specific to ensure that funds received under this subpart are used in compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions and the terms and conditions of the award:</P>
                <P>(ii) Ensure that funds received under this subpart are only spent for reasonable and necessary costs of operating programs under this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Ensure that funds received under this subpart are not used for general expenses required to carry out other responsibilities of State and local governments.</P>
                <P>(2) A State may satisfy this requirement by:</P>
                <P>(i) Using fiscal and administrative requirements applicable to the use of its own funds;</P>
                <P>(ii) Adopting new fiscal and administrative requirements; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Applying the provisions in 2 CFR part 200.</P>
                <P>(A) A State that opts to satisfy this requirement for fiscal controls and administrative procedures by applying the provisions of 2 CFR part 200 must comply with the requirements therein.</P>
                <P>(B) A State that opts to satisfy this requirement for fiscal controls and administrative procedures by applying the provisions of 2 CFR part 200 must also ensure that recipients of the State's CDBG funds comply with 2 CFR part 200.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Program income.</E> (1) For the purposes of this subpart, “program income” is defined as gross income received by a State, a unit of general local government, or a subgrantee of the unit of general local government that was generated from the use of CDBG funds, regardless of when the CDBG funds were appropriated and whether the activity has been closed out, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. When income is generated by an activity that is only partially assisted with CDBG funds, the income must be prorated to reflect the percentage of CDBG funds used (e.g., a single loan supported by CDBG funds and other funds; or a single parcel of land purchased with CDBG funds and other funds). Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or improved with CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) Proceeds from the disposition of equipment purchased with CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(iii) Gross income from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired by the unit of general local government or subgrantee of the unit of general local government with CDBG funds, less the costs incidental to the generation of the income;</P>
                <P>(iv) Gross income from the use or rental of real property, owned by the unit of general local government or other entity carrying out a CDBG activity that was constructed or improved with CDBG funds, less the costs incidental to the generation of the income;</P>
                <P>(v) Payments of principal and interest on loans made using CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section;</P>
                <P>(vi) Proceeds from the sale of loans made with CDBG funds, less reasonable legal and other costs incurred in the course of such sale that are not otherwise eligible costs under sections 105(a)(13) or 106(d)(3)(A) of the Act;</P>
                <P>(vii) Proceeds from the sale of obligations secured by loans made with CDBG funds, less reasonable legal and other costs incurred in the course of such sale that are not otherwise eligible costs under sections 105(a)(13) or 106(d)(3)(A) of the Act;</P>

                <P>(ix) Interest earned on program income pending disposition of the income;</P>
                <P>(x) Funds collected through special assessments made against nonresidential properties and properties owned and occupied by households not of low and moderate income, if the special assessments are used to recover all or part of the CDBG portion of a public improvement; and</P>

                </P>
                <P>(2) “Program income” does not include the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The total amount of funds, which does not exceed $35,000 received in a single year from activities, other than revolving loan funds that is retained by a unit of general local government and its subgrantees (all funds received from revolving loan funds are considered program income, regardless of amount);</P>
                <P>(ii) Amounts generated by activities eligible under section 105(a)(15) of the Act and carried out by an entity under the authority of section 105(a)(15) of the Act;</P>
                <P>(iii) Payments of principal and interest made by a subgrantee carrying out a CDBG activity for a unit of general local government, toward a loan from the local government to the subgrantee, to the extent that program income received by the subgrantee is used for such payments;</P>
                <P>(iv) The following classes of interest, which must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to the Department of the Treasury, and will not be reallocated under section 106(c) or (d) of the Act:</P>
                <P>(A) Interest income from loans or other forms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities determined by HUD to be not eligible under § 570.482 or section 105(a) of the Act, to fail to meet a national objective in accordance with the requirements of § 570.483, or to fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this subpart or the Act;</P>
                <P>(B) Interest income from deposits of amounts reimbursed to a State's CDBG program account prior to the state's disbursement of the reimbursed funds for eligible purposes; and</P>
                <P>(C) Interest income received by units of general local government on deposits of grant funds before disbursement of the funds for activities, except that the unit of general local government may keep interest payments of up to $100 per year for administrative expenses otherwise permitted to be paid with CDBG funds.</P>
                <P>(v) Proceeds from the sale of real property purchased or improved with CDBG funds, if the proceeds are received more than 5 years after expiration of the grant agreement between the State and the unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>(3) The State may permit the unit of general local government which receives or will receive program income to retain it, subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, or may require the unit of general local government to pay the program income to the State. The State, however, must permit the unit of general local government to retain the program income if it will be used to continue the activity from which it was derived. The State will determine when an activity is being continued.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Program income paid to the State.</E> Except as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the State may require the unit of general local government that receives or will receive program income to return the program income to the State. Program income that is paid to the State is treated as additional CDBG funds subject to the requirements of this subpart. Except for program income retained and used by the State for administrative costs or technical assistance under paragraph (a) of this section, program income paid to the State must be distributed to units of general local government in accordance with the method of distribution in the action plan under 24 CFR 91.320(k)(1)(i) that is in effect at the time the program income is distributed. To the maximum extent feasible, the State must distribute program income before it makes additional withdrawals from the United States Treasury, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Program income retained by a unit of general local government.</E> A State may permit a unit of general local government that receives or will receive program income to retain it. Alternatively, a State may require that the unit of general local government pay any such income to the State unless the exception in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section applies.</P>

                <P>(A) A State must permit the unit of general local government to retain the program income if the program income will be used to continue the activity from which it was derived. A State will determine when an activity is being <PRTPAGE P="106"/>continued. In making such a determination, a State may consider whether the unit of general local government is or will be unable to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section or other requirements of this part, and the extent to which the program income is unlikely to be applied to continue the activity within the reasonably near future. When a State determines that the program income will be applied to continue the activity from which it was derived, but the amount of program income held by the unit of general local government exceeds projected cash needs for the reasonably near future, the State may require the local government to return all or part of the program income to the State until such time as it is needed by the unit of general local government. When a State determines that a unit of local government is not likely to apply any significant amount of program income to continue the activity within a reasonable amount of time, or that it is not likely to apply the program income in accordance with applicable requirements, the State may require the unit of general local government to return all of the program income to the State for disbursement to other units of local government. A State that intends to require units of general local government to return program income in accordance with this paragraph must describe its approach in the State's action plan required under 24 CFR 91.320 of this title or in a substantial amendment if the State intends to implement this option after the action plan is submitted to and approved by HUD.</P>
                <P>(B) Program income that is received and retained by the unit of general local government is treated as additional CDBG funds and is subject to all applicable requirements of this subpart, regardless of whether the activity that generated the program income has been closed out. If the grant between the State and the unit of general local government that generated the program income is still open when it is generated, program income permitted to be retained will be considered part of the unit of general local government's grant that generated the program income. If the grant between the State and the unit of general local government is closed out, program income permitted to be retained will be considered to be part of the unit of general local government's most recently awarded open grant. If the unit of general local government has no open grants with the State, the program income retained by the unit of general local government will be counted as part of the State's program year in which the program income was received. A State must employ one or more of the following methods to ensure that units of general local government comply with applicable program income requirements:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Maintaining contractual relationships with units of general local government for the duration of the existence of the program income;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Closing out the underlying activity, but requiring as a condition of closeout that the unit of general local government obtain advance State approval of either a unit of general local government's plan for the use of program income or of each use of program income by grant recipients via regularly occurring reports and requests for approval;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Closing out the underlying activity, but requiring as a condition of closeout that the unit of general local government report to the State when new program income is received; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) With prior HUD approval, other approaches that demonstrate that the State will ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart by units of general local government.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Transfer of program income to Entitlement program.</E> A unit of general local government that becomes eligible to be an Entitlement grantee may request the State's approval to transfer State CDBG grant-generated program income to the unit of general local government's Entitlement program. A State may approve the transfer, provided that the unit of general local government:</P>
                <P>(A) Has officially elected to participate in the Entitlement grant program;</P>

                <P>(B) Agrees to use such program income in accordance with Entitlement program requirements; and<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
                </P>
                <P>(C) Has set up Integrated Disbursement Information System (IDIS) access and agrees to enter receipt of program income into IDIS.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Transfer of program income of grantees losing Entitlement status.</E> Upon entry into the State CDBG program, a unit of general local government that has lost or relinquished its Entitlement status must, with respect to program income that a unit of general local government would otherwise be permitted to retain, either:</P>
                <P>(A) Retain program income generated under Entitlement grants and continue to comply with Entitlement program requirements for program income; or</P>
                <P>(B) Retain the program income and transfer it to the State CDBG program, in which case the unit of general local government must comply with the State's rules for program income and the requirements of this paragraph (e).</P>
                <P>(4) The State must report on the receipt and use of all program income (whether retained by units of general local government or paid to the State) in its annual performance and evaluation report.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Revolving funds.</E> (1) The State may permit units of general local government to establish revolving funds to carry out specific, identified activities. A revolving fund, for this purpose, is a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established to carry out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use in carrying out such activities. These payments to the revolving fund are program income and must be substantially disbursed from the revolving fund before additional grant funds are drawn from the Treasury for revolving fund activities. Such program income is not required to be disbursed for non-revolving fund activities.</P>
                <P>(2) The State may establish one or more State revolving funds to distribute grants to units of general local government throughout a State or a region of the State to carry out specific, identified activities. A revolving fund, for this purpose, is a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established to fund grants to units of general local government to carry out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for additional grants to units of general local government to carry out such activities. Program income in the revolving fund must be disbursed from the fund before additional grant funds are drawn from the Treasury for payments to units of general local government which could be funded from the revolving fund.</P>
                <P>(3) A revolving fund established by either the State or unit of general local government shall not be directly funded or capitalized with grant funds.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Procurement.</E> When procuring property or services to be paid for in whole or in part with CDBG funds, the State shall follow its procurement policies and procedures. The State shall establish requirements for procurement policies and procedures for units of general local government, based on full and open competition. Methods of procurement (e.g., small purchase, sealed bids/formal advertising, competitive proposals, and noncompetitive proposals) and their applicability shall be specified by the State. Cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction costs methods of contracting shall not be used. The policies and procedures shall also include standards of conduct governing employees engaged in the award or administration of contracts. (Other conflicts of interest are covered by § 570.489(h).) The State shall ensure that all purchase orders and contracts include any clauses required by Federal statutes, Executive orders, and implementing regulations. The State shall make subrecipient and contractor determinations in accordance with the standards in 2 CFR 200.330.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Conflict of interest</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (i) In the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services by the States, units of local general governments, and subrecipients, the conflict of interest provisions in paragraph (g) of this section shall apply.</P>

                <P>(ii) In all cases not governed by paragraph (g) of this section, this paragraph (h) shall apply. Such cases include the acquisition and disposition of real property and the provision of assistance with CDBG funds by the unit <PRTPAGE P="108"/>of general local government or its subrecipients, to individuals, businesses and other private entities.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Conflicts prohibited.</E> Except for eligible administrative or personnel costs, the general rule is that no persons described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to CDBG activities assisted under this subpart or who are in a position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a financial interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract or agreement with respect thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for themselves or those with whom they have family or business ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> The conflict of interest provisions for paragraph (h)(2) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the State, or of a unit of general local government, or of any designated public agencies, or subrecipients which are receiving CDBG funds.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Exceptions: Thresholds requirements.</E> Upon written request by the State, an exception to the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section involving an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the State may be granted by HUD on a case-by-case basis. In all other cases, the State may grant such an exception upon written request of the unit of general local government provided the State shall fully document its determination in compliance with all requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section including the State's position with respect to each factor at paragraph (h)(5) of this section and such documentation shall be available for review by the public and by HUD. An exception may be granted after it is determined that such an exception will serve to further the purpose of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the program or project of the State or unit of general local government as appropriate. An exception may be considered only after the State or unit of general local government, as appropriate, has provided the following:</P>
                <P>(i) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>
                <P>(ii) An opinion of the attorney for the State or the unit of general local government, as appropriate, that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Factors to be considered for exceptions.</E> In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section have been satisfactorily met, the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable, shall be considered:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;</P>
                <P>(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low or moderate income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
                <P>(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section;</P>
                <P>(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the State or the unit of general local government or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</P>
                <P>(vii) Any other relevant considerations.<PRTPAGE P="109"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Closeout of grants to units of general local government.</E> The State shall establish requirements for timely closeout of grants to units of general local government and shall take action to ensure the timely closeout of such grants.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Change of use of real property.</E> The standards described in this section apply to real property within the unit of general local government's control (including activities undertaken by subrecipients) which was acquired or improved in whole or in part using CDBG funds in excess of the threshold for small purchase procurement (2 CFR 200.88). These standards shall apply from the date CDBG funds are first spent for the property until five years after closeout of the unit of general local government's grant.</P>
                <P>(1) A unit of general local governments may not change the use or planned use of any such property (including the beneficiaries of such use) from that for which the acquisition or improvement was made, unless the unit of general local government provides affected citizens with reasonable notice of and opportunity to comment on any proposed change, and either:</P>
                <P>(i) The new use of the property qualifies as meeting one of the national objectives and is not a building for the general conduct of government; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section are met.</P>
                <P>(2) If the unit of general local government determines, after consultation with affected citizens, that it is appropriate to change the use of the property to a use which does not qualify under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, it may retain or dispose of the property for the changed use if the unit of general local government's CDBG program is reimbursed or the State's CDBG program is reimbursed, at the discretion of the State. The reimbursement shall be in the amount of the current fair market value of the property, less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-CDBG funds for acquisition of, and improvements to, the property, except that if the change in use occurs after grant closeout but within 5 years of such closeout, the unit of general local government shall make the reimbursement to the State's CDBG program account.</P>
                <P>(3) Following the reimbursement of the CDBG program in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the property no longer will be subject to any CDBG requirements.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Accountability for real and personal property.</E> The State shall establish and implement requirements, consistent with State law and the purposes and requirements of this subpart (including paragraph (j) of this section) governing the use, management, and disposition of real and personal property acquired with CDBG funds.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Debarment and suspension.</E> The requirements in 2 CFR part 2424 are applicable. CDBG funds may not be provided to excluded or disqualified persons.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Subrecipient monitoring and management.</E> The provisions of 2 CFR 200.330 through 200.332 are applicable.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Audits.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, audits of a State and units of general local government shall be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, which implements the Single Audit Act. States shall develop and administer an audits management system to ensure that audits of units of general local government are conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Grant Closeout.</E>—HUD will close grants to States in accordance with the grant closeout requirements of 2 CFR 200.343.</P>
                <P>(p) <E T="03">Cost principles and prior approval.</E> A State must ensure that costs incurred by the State and by its recipients are in conformance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E. All cost items described in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, that require Federal agency approval are allowable without prior approval of HUD, to the extent that they otherwise comply with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and are otherwise eligible, except for the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Depreciation methods for fixed assets shall not be changed without the express approval of the cognizant Federal agency (2 CFR 200.436).</P>

                <P>(1) Whether the state has distributed CDBG funds to units of general local government in a timely manner in conformance to the method of distribution described in its action plan under part 91 of this title;</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the state has carried out its certifications in compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart and other applicable laws; and</P>
                <P>(3) Whether the state has made reviews and audits of the units of general local government required by § 570.492.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Information considered.</E> In conducting performance reviews and audits, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the state's performance report, records maintained by the state, findings from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and the status of the state's unexpended grant funds. HUD may also consider relevant information on the state's performance gained from other sources, including litigation, citizens' comments, and other information provided by the state. A State's failure to maintain records in accordance with § 570.490 may result in a finding that the State has failed to meet the applicable requirement to which the record pertains.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Timely distribution of funds by states.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) States are encouraged to adopt and achieve a goal of obligating and announcing 95 percent of funds to units of general local government within 12 months of the state signing its grant agreement with HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) HUD will review each state to determine if the state has distributed CDBG funds in a timely manner. The state's distribution of CDBG funds is timely if:</P>
                <P>(1) All of the state's annual grant (excluding state administration) has been obligated and announced to units of general local government within 15 months of the state signing its grant agreement with HUD; and</P>
                <P>(2) Recaptured funds and program income received by the state are expeditiously obligated and announced to units of general local government.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reviews and audits response.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If HUD's review and audit under § 570.493 results in a negative determination, or if HUD otherwise determines that a state or unit of general local government has failed to comply with any requirement of this subpart, the state will be given an opportunity to contest the finding and will be requested to submit a plan for corrective action. If the state is unsuccessful in contesting the validity of the finding to the satisfaction of HUD, or if the state's plan for corrective action is not satisfactory to HUD, HUD may take one or more of the following actions to prevent a continuation of the deficiency; mitigate, to the extent possible, the adverse effects or consequence of the deficiency; or prevent a recurrence of the deficiency:</P>
                <P>(1) Issue a letter of warning that advises the State of the deficiency and puts the state on notice that additional action will be taken if the deficiency is not corrected or is repeated;</P>
                <P>(2) Advise the state that additional information or assurances will be required before acceptance of one or more of the certifications required for the succeeding year grant;</P>
                <P>(3) Advise the state to suspend or terminate disbursement of funds for a deficient activity or grant;</P>

                <P>(4) Advise the state to reimburse its grant in any amounts improperly expended;<PRTPAGE P="112"/>
                </P>
                <P>(5) Change the method of payment to the state from an advance basis to a reimbursement basis;</P>
                <P>(6) Based on the state's current failure to comply with a requirement of this subpart which will affect the use of the succeeding year grant, condition the use of the succeeding fiscal years grant funds upon appropriate corrective action by the state. When the use of funds is conditioned, HUD shall specify the reasons for the conditions and the actions necessary to satisfy the conditions.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) Whenever HUD determines that a state or unit of general local government which is a recipient of CDBG funds has failed to comply with section 109 of the Act (nondiscrimination requirements), HUD shall notify the governor of the State or chief executive officer of the unit of general local government of the noncompliance and shall request the governor or the chief executive officer to secure compliance. If within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, the governor or chief executive officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, HUD may take the following action:</P>
                <P>(i) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted;</P>
                <P>(ii) Exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-7);</P>
                <P>(iii) Exercise the powers and functions provided for in § 570.496; or</P>
                <P>(iv) Take such other action as may be provided by law.</P>
                <P>(2) When a matter is referred to the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or whenever HUD has reason to believe that a State or unit of general local government is engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of section 109 of the Act, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for such relief as may be appropriate, including injunctive relief.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Action pursuant to this section will be taken only after at least one of the corrective or remedial actions specified in § 570.495 has been taken, and only then if the State or unit of general local government has not made an appropriate or timely response.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Remedies.</E> (1) If HUD finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a State or unit of general local government has failed to comply with any provision of this subpart, until HUD is satisfied that there is no longer failure to comply, HUD shall:</P>
                <P>(i) Terminate payments to the state;</P>
                <P>(ii) Reduce payments for current or future grants to the state by an amount equal to the amount of CDBG funds distributed or used without compliance with the requirements of this subpart;</P>
                <P>(iii) Limit the availability of payments to the state to activities not affected by the failure to comply or to activities designed to overcome the failure to comply;</P>
                <P>(iv) Based on the state's failure to comply with a requirement of this subpart (other than the state's current failure to comply which will affect the use of the succeeding year grant), condition the use of the grant funds upon appropriate corrective action by the state specified by HUD; or</P>
                <P>(v) With respect to a CDBG grant awarded by the state to a unit of general local government, withhold, reduce, or withdraw the grant, require the state to withhold, reduce, or withdraw the grant, or take other action as appropriate, except that CDBG funds expended on eligible activities shall not be recaptured or deducted from future CDBG grants to such unit of general local government.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD may on due notice suspend payments at any time after the issuance of a notice of opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, pending such hearing and a final decision, to the extent HUD determines such action necessary to prevent a continuation of the noncompliance.</P>

                <P>(c) In lieu of, or in addition to, the action authorized by paragraph (b) of this section, if HUD has reason to believe that the state or unit of general local government has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this subpart, HUD may:<PRTPAGE P="113"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted; and</P>
                <P>(2) Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the CDBG funds which was not expended in accordance with this subpart, or for mandatory or injunctive relief.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Proceedings.</E> When HUD proposes to take action pursuant to this section, the respondent in the proceedings will be the state. At the option of HUD, a unit of general local government may also be a respondent. These procedures are to be followed before imposition of a sanction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Notice of opportunity for hearing.</E> HUD shall notify the respondent in writing of the proposed action and of the opportunity for a hearing. The notice shall be sent to the respondent by first class mail and shall provide notice:</P>
                <P>(i) In a manner which is adequate to allow the respondent to prepare its response, the basis upon which HUD determined that the respondent failed to comply with a provision of this subpart;</P>
                <P>(ii) That the hearing procedures are governed by these rules;</P>
                <P>(iii) That the respondent has 14 days from receipt of the notice within which to provide a written request for a hearing to the Docket Clerk, Office of Administrative Law Judges, and the address and telephone number of the Docket Clerk;</P>
                <P>(iv) Of the action which HUD proposes to take and that the authority for this action is § 570.496 of this subpart;</P>
                <P>(v) That if the respondent fails to request a hearing within the time specified, HUD's determination that the respondent failed to comply with a provision of this subpart shall be final and HUD may proceed to take the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Initiation of hearing.</E> The respondent shall be allowed 14 days from receipt of the notice within which to notify HUD in writing of its request for a hearing. If no request is received within the time specified, HUD's determination that the respondent failed to comply with a provision of this subpart shall be final and HUD may proceed to take the proposed action.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Administrative Law Judge.</E> Proceedings conducted under these rules shall be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), appointed as provided by section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 3105). The case shall be referred to the ALJ by HUD at the time a hearing is requested. The ALJ shall promptly notify the parties of the time and place at which the hearing will be held. The ALJ shall conduct a fair and impartial hearing and take all action necessary to avoid delay in the disposition of proceedings and to maintain order. The ALJ shall have all powers necessary to those ends, including but not limited to the power:</P>
                <P>(i) To administer oaths and affirmations;</P>
                <P>(ii) To issue subpoenas as authorized by law;</P>
                <P>(iii) To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;</P>
                <P>(iv) To order or limit discovery before the hearing as the interests of justice may require;</P>
                <P>(v) To regulate the course of the hearing and the conduct of the parties and their counsel;</P>
                <P>(vi) To hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties;</P>
                <P>(vii) To consider and rule upon all procedural and other motions appropriate in adjudicative proceedings; and</P>
                <P>(viii) To make and file initial determinations.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Ex parte communications.</E> An ex parte communication is any communication with an ALJ, direct or indirect, oral or written, concerning the merits or procedures of any pending proceeding which is made by a party in the absence of any other party. Ex parte communications are prohibited except where the purpose and content of the communication have been disclosed in advance or simultaneously to all parties, or the communication is a request for information concerning the status of the case. Any ALJ who receives an ex parte communication <PRTPAGE P="114"/>which the ALJ knows or has reason to believe is unauthorized shall promptly place the communication, or its substance, in all files and shall furnish copies to all parties. Unauthorized ex parte communications shall not be taken into consideration in deciding any matter in issue.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">The hearing.</E> All parties shall have the right to be represented at the hearing by counsel. The ALJ shall conduct the proceedings in an expeditious manner while allowing the parties to present all oral and written evidence which tends to support their respective positions, but the ALJ shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. HUD has the burden of proof in showing by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent failed to comply with a provision of this subpart. Each party shall be allowed to cross-examine adverse witnesses and to rebut and comment upon evidence presented by the other party. Hearings shall be open to the public. So far as the orderly conduct of the hearing permits, interested persons other than the parties may appear and participate in the hearing.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Transcripts.</E> Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed only by a reporter under the supervision of the ALJ. The original transcript shall be a part of the record and shall constitute the sole official transcript. Respondents and the public, at their own expense, shall obtain copies of the transcript.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">The ALJ's decisions.</E> At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ shall give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions and supporting reasons therefor. Generally, within 60 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ shall prepare a written decision which includes a Statement of findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record and the appropriate sanction or denial thereof. The decision shall be based on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. A copy of the decision shall be furnished to the parties immediately by first class mail and shall include a notice that any requests for review by the Secretary must be made in writing to the Secretary within 30 days of the receipt of the decision.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Record.</E> The transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with the decision of the ALJ and all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision and, on payment of its reasonable cost, shall be made available to the parties. After reaching the initial decision, the ALJ shall certify to the complete record and forward the record to the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Review by the Secretary.</E> The decision by the ALJ shall constitute the final decision of HUD unless, within 30 days after the receipt of the decision, either the respondent or the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development files an exception and request for review by the Secretary. The excepting party must transmit simultaneously to the Secretary and the other party the request for review and the bases of the party's exceptions to the findings of the ALJ. The other party shall be allowed 30 days from receipt of the exception to provide the Secretary and the excepting party with a written reply. The Secretary shall then review the record of the case, including the exceptions and the reply. On the basis of such review, the Secretary shall issue a written determination, including a Statement of the rationale therefor, affirming, modifying or revoking the decision of the ALJ. The Secretary's decision shall be made and transmitted to the parties within 60 days after the decision of the ALJ was furnished to the parties.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> The respondent may seek judicial review of HUD's decision pursuant to section 111(c) of the Act.</P>

                <P>Pursuant to section 106(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, a State has the right to elect, in such manner and at such time as the Secretary may prescribe, to administer funds allocated under subpart A of this part for use in nonentitlement areas of the State. After January 26, 1995, any <PRTPAGE P="115"/>State which elects to administer the allocation of CDBG funds for use in nonentitlement areas of the State in any year must, in addition to all other requirements of this subpart, submit a pledge by the State in accordance with section 108(d)(2) of the Act, and in a form acceptable to HUD, of any future CDBG grants it may receive under subpart A and this subpart. Such pledge shall be for the purpose of assuring repayment of any debt obligations (as defined in § 570.701), in accordance with their terms, that HUD may have guaranteed in the respective State on behalf of any nonentitlement public entity (as defined in § 570.701) or its designated public agency prior to the State's election.</P>

                <P>For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms shall apply:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Program income</E> means gross income received by the recipient or a subrecipient directly generated from the use of CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or improved with CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(ii) Proceeds from the disposition of equipment purchased with CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(iii) Gross income from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired by the recipient or by a subrecipient with CDBG funds, less costs incidental to generation of the income;</P>
                <P>(iv) Gross income from the use or rental of real property, owned by the recipient or by a subrecipient, that was constructed or improved with CDBG funds, less costs incidental to generation of the income;</P>
                <P>(v) Payments of principal and interest on loans made using CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;</P>
                <P>(vi) Proceeds from the sale of loans made with CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(vii) Proceeds from sale of obligations secured by loans made with CDBG funds;</P>
                <P>(viii) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(ix) Interest earned on program income pending its disposition; and</P>

                <P>(x) Funds collected through special assessments made against properties owned and occupied by households <E T="03">not</E> of low and moderate income, where the assessments are used to recover all or part of the CDBG portion of a public improvement.</P>
                <P>(2) Program income does not include income earned (except for interest described in § 570.513) on grant advances from the U.S. Treasury. The following items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to the U.S. Treasury, and will not be reallocated under section 106(c) or (d) of the Act:</P>
                <P>(i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U.S. Treasury;</P>
                <P>(ii) Interest earned on loans or other forms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for activities determined by HUD either to be ineligible or to fail to meet a national objective in accordance with the requirements of subpart C of this part, or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Interest earned on the investment of amounts reimbursed to the CDBG program account prior to the use of the reimbursed funds for eligible purposes.</P>

                <P>(3) The calculation of the amount of program income for the recipient's CDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal and/or interest on CDBG-funded loans received from grantees if such payments are made using program income received by the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transferred program income to the grantee.) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used for reporting purposes, for purposes of applying the requirement <PRTPAGE P="116"/>under § 570.504(b)(2)(iii), and in determining limitations on planning and administration and public services activities to be paid for with CDBG funds.</P>
                <P>(4) Program income does not include:</P>
                <P>(i) Any income received in a single program year by the recipient and all its subrecipients if the total amount of such income does not exceed $25,000; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Amounts generated by activities that are financed by a loan guaranteed under section 108 of the Act and meet one or more of the public benefit criteria specified at § 570.209(b)(2)(v) or are carried out in conjunction with a grant under section 108(q) in an area determined by HUD to meet the eligibility requirements for designation as an Urban Empowerment Zone pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, subpart B. Such exclusion shall not apply if CDBG funds are used to repay the guaranteed loan. When such a guaranteed loan is partially repaid with CDBG funds, the amount generated shall be prorated to reflect the percentage of CDBG funds used. Amounts generated by activities financed with loans guaranteed under section 108 which are not defined as program income shall be treated as miscellaneous revenue and shall not be subject to any of the requirements of this part, except that the use of such funds shall be limited to activities that are located in a revitalization strategy area and implement a HUD approved area revitalization strategy pursuant to § 91.215(e) of this title. However, such treatment shall not affect the right of the Secretary to require the section 108 borrower to pledge such amounts as security for the guaranteed loan. The determination whether such amounts shall constitute program income shall be governed by the provisions of the contract required at § 570.705(b)(1).</P>
                <P>(5) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities carried out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance (the costs of fundraising are generally unallowable under the applicable OMB circulars referenced in 24 CFR 84.27), funds collected through special assessments used to recover the non-CDBG portion of a public improvement, and proceeds from the disposition of real property acquired or improved with CDBG funds when the disposition occurs after the applicable time period specified in § 570.503(b)(8) for subrecipient-controlled property, or in § 570.505 for recipient-controlled property.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Revolving fund</E> means a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established for the purpose of carrying out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use in carrying out the same activities. Each revolving loan fund's cash balance must be held in an interest-bearing account, and any interest paid on CDBG funds held in this account shall be considered interest earned on grant advances and must be remitted to HUD for transmittal to the U.S. Treasury no less frequently than annually. (Interest paid by borrowers on eligible loans made from the revolving loan fund shall be program income and treated accordingly.)</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Subrecipient</E> means a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization, or a for-profit entity authorized under § 570.201(o), receiving CDBG funds from the recipient or another subrecipient to undertake activities eligible for such assistance under subpart C of this part. The term excludes an entity receiving CDBG funds from the recipient under the authority of § 570.204, unless the grantee explicitly designates it as a subrecipient. The term includes a public agency designated by a unit of general local government to receive a loan guarantee under subpart M of this part, but does not include contractors providing supplies, equipment, construction, or services subject to the procurement requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D.</P>

The recipient is also responsible for determining the adequacy of performance under subrecipient agreements and procurement contracts, and for taking appropriate action when performance problems arise, such as the actions described in § 570.910. Where a unit of general local government is participating with, or as part of, an urban county, or as part of a metropolitan city, the recipient is responsible for applying to the unit of general local government the same requirements as are applicable to subrecipients, except that the five-year period identified under § 570.503(b)(8)(i) shall begin with the date that the unit of general local government is no longer considered by HUD to be a part of the metropolitan city or urban county, as applicable, instead of the date that the subrecipient agreement expires.</P>

                <P>(5) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income received after closeout from the disposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that such income shall be used for activities that meet one of the national objectives in § 570.901 and the eligibility requirements described in section 105 of the Act.</P>

The following additional limitations apply to the use of escrow accounts for residential rehabilitation loans and grants closed after September 7, 1990:</P>

                <P>(1) The use of escrow accounts under this section is limited to loans and grants for the rehabilitation of primarily residential properties containing no more than four dwelling units (and accessory neighborhood-scale non-residential space within the same structure, if any, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> a store front below a dwelling unit).</P>
                <P>(2) An escrow account shall not be used unless the contract between the property owner and the contractor selected to do the rehabilitation work specifically provides that payment to the contractor shall be made through an escrow account maintained by the recipient, by a subrecipient as defined in § 570.500(c), by a public agency designated under § 570.501(a), or by an agent under a procurement contact governed by the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart D. No deposit to the escrow account shall be made until after the contract has been executed between the property owner and the rehabilitation contractor.</P>
                <P>(3) All funds withdrawn under this section shall be deposited into one interest earning account with a financial institution. Separate bank accounts shall not be established for individual loans and grants.</P>
                <P>(4) The amount of funds deposited into an escrow account shall be limited to the amount expected to be disbursed within 10 working days from the date of deposit. If the escrow account, for whatever reason, at any time contains funds exceeding 10 days cash needs, the grantee immediately shall transfer the excess funds to its program account. In the program account, the excess funds shall be treated as funds erroneously drawn in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Treasury Financial Manual, paragraph 6-2075.30.</P>
                <P>(5) Funds deposited into an escrow account shall be used only to pay the actual costs of rehabilitation incurred by the owner under the contract with a private contractor. Other eligible costs related to the rehabilitation loan or grant, e.g., the recipient's administrative costs under § 570.206 or rehabilitation services costs under § 570.202(b)(9), are not permissible uses of escrowed funds. Such other eligible rehabilitation costs shall be paid under normal CDBG payment procedures (e.g., from withdrawals of grant funds under the recipient's letter of credit with the Treasury).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Interest.</E> Interest earned on escrow accounts established in accordance with this section, less any service charges for the account, shall be remitted to HUD at least quarterly but not more frequently than monthly. Interest earned on escrow accounts is not required to be remitted to HUD to the extent the interest is attributable to the investment of program income.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Remedies for noncompliance.</E> If HUD determines that a recipient has failed to use an escrow account in accordance with this section, HUD may, in addition to imposing any other sanctions provided for under this part, require the recipient to discontinue the use of escrow accounts, in whole or in part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Lump sum drawdown for financing of property rehabilitation activities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Subject to the conditions prescribed in this section, recipients may draw funds from the letter of credit in a lump sum to establish a rehabilitation fund in one or more private financial institutions for the purpose of financing the rehabilitation of privately owned properties. The fund may be used in conjunction with various rehabilitation financing techniques, including loans, interest subsidies, loan guarantees, loan reserves, or such other uses as may be approved by HUD consistent with the objectives of this section. The fund may also be used for making grants, but only for the purpose of leveraging non-CDBG funds for the rehabilitation of the same property.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Limitation on drawdown of grant funds.</E> (1) The funds that a recipient deposits to a rehabilitation fund shall not exceed the grant amount that the recipient reasonably expects will be required, together with anticipated program income from interest and loan repayments, for the rehabilitation activities during the period specified in the agreement to undertake activities, based on either:</P>
                <P>(i) Prior level of rehabilitation activity; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Rehabilitation staffing and management capacity during the period specified in the agreement to undertake activities.</P>
                <P>(2) No grant funds may be deposited under this section solely for the purpose of investment, notwithstanding that the interest or other income is to be used for the rehabilitation activities.</P>
                <P>(3) The recipient's rehabilitation program administrative costs and the administrative costs of the financial institution may not be funded through lump sum drawdown. Such costs must be paid from periodic letter of credit withdrawals in accordance with standard procedures or from program income, other than program income generated by the lump sum distribution.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards to be met.</E> The following standards shall apply to all lump sum drawdowns of CDBG funds for rehabilitation:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Eligible rehabilitation activities.</E> The rehabilitation fund shall be used to finance the rehabilitation of privately owned properties eligible under the general policies in § 570.200 and the specific provisions of either § 570.202, including the acquisition of properties for rehabilitation, or § 570.203.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Requirements for agreement.</E> The recipient shall execute a written agreement with one or more private financial institutions for the operation of the rehabilitation fund. The agreement shall specify the obligations and responsibilities of the parties, the terms and conditions on which CDBG funds are to be deposited and used or returned, the anticipated level of rehabilitation activities by the financial institution, the rate of interest and other benefits to be provided by the financial institution in return for the lump sum deposit, and such other terms as are necessary for compliance with the provisions of this section. Upon execution of the agreement, a copy must be provided to the HUD field office for its record and use in monitoring. Any modifications made during the term of the agreement must also be provided to HUD.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Period to undertake activities.</E> The agreement must provide that the rehabilitation fund may only be used for authorized activities during a period of no more than two years. The lump sum deposit shall be made only after the agreement is fully executed.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Time limit on use of deposited funds.</E> Use of the deposited funds for rehabilitation financing assistance must start (e.g., first loan must be made, subsidized or guaranteed) within 45 days of the deposit. In addition, substantial disbursements from the fund must occur within 180 days of the receipt of the deposit. (Where CDBG funds are used as a guarantee, the funds that must be substantially disbursed are the guaranteed funds.) For a recipient with an agreement specifying two years to undertake activities, the disbursement of 25 percent of the fund (deposit plus any interest earned) within 180 days <PRTPAGE P="130"/>will be regarded as meeting this requirement. If a recipient with an agreement specifying two years to undertake activities determines that it has had substantial disbursement from the fund within the 180 days although it had not met this 25 percent threshold, the justification for the recipient's determination shall be included in the program file. Should use of deposited funds not start within 45 days, or substantial disbursement from such fund not occur within 180 days, the recipient may be required by HUD to return all or part of the deposited funds to the recipient's letter of credit.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Program activity.</E> Recipients shall review the level of program activity on a yearly basis. Where activity is substantially below that anticipated, program funds shall be returned to the recipient's letter of credit.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Termination of agreement.</E> In the case of substantial failure by a private financial institution to comply with the terms of a lump sum drawdown agreement, the recipient shall terminate its agreement, provide written justification for the action, withdraw all unobligated deposited funds from the private financial institution, and return the funds to the recipient's letter of credit.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Return of unused deposits.</E> At the end of the period specified in the agreement for undertaking activities, all unobligated deposited funds shall be returned to the recipient's letter of credit unless the recipient enters into a new agreement conforming to the requirements of this section. Any program income which will be governed by a new agreement must be identified in the current program year Action Plan, pursuant to 24 CFR 91.220(l). In addition, the recipient shall reserve the right to withdraw any unobligated deposited funds required by HUD in the exercise of corrective or remedial actions authorized under § 570.910(b), § 570.911, § 570.912 or § 570.913.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Rehabilitation loans made with non-CDBG funds.</E> If the deposited funds or program income derived from deposited funds are used to subsidize or guarantee repayment of rehabilitation loans made with non-CDBG funds, or to provide a supplemental loan or grant to the borrower of the non-CDBG funds, the rehabilitation activities are considered to be CDBG-assisted activities subject to the requirements applicable to such activities, except that repayment of non-CDBG funds shall not be treated as program income.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Provision of consideration.</E> In consideration for the lump sum deposit by the recipient in a private financial institution, the deposit must result in appropriate benefits in support of the recipient's local rehabilitation program. Minimum requirements for such benefits are:</P>
                <P>(i) Grantees shall require the financial institution to pay interest on the lump sum deposit.</P>
                <P>(A) The interest rate paid by the financial institution shall be no more than three points below the rate on one year Treasury obligations at constant maturity.</P>
                <P>(B) When an agreement sets a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the agreement, the rate should be based on the rate at the time the agreement is excuted.</P>
                <P>(C) The agreement may provide for an interest rate that would fluctuate periodically during the term of the agreement, but at no time shall the rate be established at more than three points below the rate on one year Treasury obligations at constant maturity.</P>
                <P>(ii) In addition to the payment of interest, at least one of the following benefits must be provided by the financial institution:</P>
                <P>(A) Leverage of the deposited funds so that the financial institution commits private funds for loans in the rehabilitation program in an amount substantially in excess of the amount of the lump sum deposit;</P>
                <P>(B) Commitment of private funds by the financial institution for rehabilitation loans at below market interest rates, at higher than normal risk, or with longer than normal repayment periods; or</P>
                <P>(C) Provision of administrative services in support of the rehabilitation program by the participating financial institution at no cost or at lower than actual cost.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Program income.</E> Interest earned on lump sum deposits and payments on <PRTPAGE P="131"/>loans made from such deposits are program income and, during the period of the agreement, shall be used for rehabilitation activities under the provisions of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Outstanding findings.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no recipient shall enter into a new agreement during any period of time in which an audit or monitoring finding on a previous lump sum drawdown agreement remains unresolved.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Prior notification.</E> The recipient shall provide the HUD field office with written notification of the amount of funds to be distributed to a private financial institution before distribution under the provisions of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> The recipient shall maintain in its files a copy of the written agreement and related documents establishing conformance with this section and concerning performance by a financial institution in accordance with the agreement.</P>

This subpart K applies to grants made under the Insular Areas Program in § 570.405 and § 570.440 with the exception of § 570.612. The absence of mention herein of any other statute for which the Secretary does not have direct enforcement responsibility is not intended to be taken as an indication that, in the Secretary's opinion, such statute or Executive Order is not applicable to activities assisted under the Act. For laws that the Secretary will treat as applicable to grants made to states under section 106(d) of the Act for purposes of the determination required to be made by the Secretary pursuant to section 104(e)(2) of the Act, see § 570.487.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons at URA levels.</E> (1) A displaced person shall be provided with relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, which contains the government-wide regulations implementing the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Displaced person.</E> (i) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term “<E T="03">displaced person</E>” means any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently and involuntarily, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for an <PRTPAGE P="133"/>activity assisted under this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a permanent move from real property that is made:</P>
                <P>(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if applicable) to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs after the initial official submission to HUD (or the State, as applicable) for grant, loan, or loan guarantee funds under this part that are later provided or granted.</P>
                <P>(B) After notice by the property owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs after the date of the submission of a request for financial assistance by the property owner (or person in control of the site) that is later approved for the requested activity.</P>
                <P>(C) Before the date described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee (or State, as applicable) determines that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the requested activity.</P>
                <P>(D) After the “initiation of negotiations” if the person is the tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit and any one of the following three situations occurs:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant has not been provided with a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a monthly rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average utility costs before the initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the building/complex; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the building/complex, but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move.</P>

                <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the term “<E T="03">displaced person</E>-” does not include:</P>
                <P>(A) A person who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this basis, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance under this section;</P>
                <P>(B) A person who moves into the property after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, but who received a written notice of the expected displacement before occupancy.</P>
                <P>(C) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).</P>
                <P>(D) A person who the grantee (or State, as applicable) determines is not displaced as a direct result of the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.</P>
                <P>(iii) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) may, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a person is a displaced person under this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the type of replacement housing assistance to be provided under paragraph (b) of this section, if the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of real property, the term “<E T="03">initiation of negotiations</E>” means the execution of the grant or loan agreement between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the real property.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan.</E> The grantee shall comply with the requirements of 24 CFR part 42, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional relocation assistance.</E> Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide (or the State may permit the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons <PRTPAGE P="134"/>displaced by activities that are not subject to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide (or the State may also permit the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraphs. Unless such assistance is provided under State or local law, the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a written determination that the assistance is appropriate (see, e.g., 24 CFR 570.201(i), as applicable). The grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Acquisition of real property.</E> The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If a person disagrees with the determination of the grantee (or the state recipient, as applicable) concerning the person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment under this section, the person may file a written appeal of that determination with the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable). The appeal procedures to be followed are described in 49 CFR 24.10.

                <P>(2) In all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.317 and 200.318, the provisions of this section shall apply. Such cases include the acquisition and disposition of real property and the provision of assistance by the recipient or by its subrecipients to individuals, businesses, and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such assistance (e.g., rehabilitation, preservation, and other improvements of private properties or facilities pursuant to § 570.202; or grants, loans, and other assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities pursuant to § 570.203, 570.204, 570.455, or 570.703(i)).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflicts prohibited.</E> The general rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to CDBG activities assisted under this part, or who are in a position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a financial interest or benefit from a CDBG-assisted activity, or have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect to a CDBG-assisted activity, or with respect to the proceeds of the CDBG-assisted activity, either for themselves or those with whom they have business or immediate family ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter. For the UDAG program, the above restrictions shall apply to all activities that are a part of the UDAG project, and shall cover any such financial interest or benefit during, or at any time after, such person's tenure.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> The conflict of interest provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the recipient, or of any designated public agencies, or of subrecipients that are receiving funds under this part.</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Threshold requirements.</E> HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following documentation:</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Factors to be considered for exceptions.</E> In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall conclude that such an exception will serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's program or project, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project that would otherwise not be available;</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;</P>

                <P>(iii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low- or moderate-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit <PRTPAGE P="136"/>such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
                <P>(v) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
                <P>(vi) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</P>

                <P>(a) The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) requires certain Federal and Federally funded buildings and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that insure accessibility to, and use by, physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under this part after December 11, 1995, and that meets the definition of “residential structure” as defined in 24 CFR 40.2 or the definition of “building” as defined in 41 CFR 101-19.602(a) is subject to the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).</P>

It further provides that discrimination includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy no later than January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Further, the ADA requires the removal of architectural barriers and communication barriers that are structural in nature in existing facilities, where such removal is readily achievable—that is, easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Application requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Presubmission and citizen participation requirements.</E> (1) Before submission of an application for loan guarantee assistance to HUD, the public entity must:</P>
                <P>(i) Develop a proposed application that includes the following items:</P>
                <P>(A) The community development objectives the public entity proposes to pursue with the guaranteed loan funds.</P>
                <P>(B) The activities the public entity proposes to carry out with the guaranteed loan funds. Each activity must be described in sufficient detail, including the specific provision of § 570.703 under which it is eligible and the national objective to be met, amount of guaranteed loan funds expected to be used, and location, to allow citizens to determine the degree to which they will be affected. The proposed application must indicate which activities are expected to generate program income. The application must also describe where citizens may obtain additional information about proposed activities.</P>
                <P>(C) A description of the pledge of grants required under § 570.705(b)(2). In the case of applications by State-assisted public entities, the description shall note that pledges of grants will be made by the State and by the public entity.</P>
                <P>(D) A description of any CDBG funds, including guaranteed loan funds and grant funds, that will be used to pay fees required under § 570.705(g). The description must include an estimate of the amount of CBDG funds that will be used for this purpose. If the applicant will use grant funds to pay required fees, it must include this planned use of grant funds in its consolidated plan.</P>
                <P>(ii) Fulfill the applicable requirements in its citizen participation plan developed in accordance with § 570.704(a)(2).</P>
                <P>(iii) Publish community-wide its proposed application so as to afford affected citizens an opportunity to examine the application's contents and to provide comments on the proposed application.</P>
                <P>(iv) Prepare its final application. Once the public entity has held the public hearing and published the proposed application as required by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, respectively, the public entity must consider any such comments and views received and, if the public entity deems appropriate, modify the proposed application. Upon completion, the public entity must make the final application available to the public. The final application must describe each activity in sufficient detail to permit a clear understanding of the nature of each activity, as well as identify the specific provision of § 570.703 under which it is eligible, the national objective to be met, and the amount of guaranteed loan funds to be used. The final application must also indicate which activities are expected to generate program income.</P>

                <P>(v) If an application for loan guarantee assistance is to be submitted by an entitlement or nonentitlement public entity simultaneously with the public entity's submission for its grant, the public entity shall include and identify in its proposed and final consolidated plan the activities to be undertaken with the guaranteed loan funds, the national objective to be met by each of these activities, the amount of any program income expected to be <PRTPAGE P="140"/>received during the program year, and the amount of guaranteed loan funds to be used. The public entity shall also include in the consolidated plan a description of the pledge of grants, as required under § 570.705(b)(2), and the use of grant funds to pay for any fees required under § 570.705(g). In such cases the proposed and final application requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (iii), and (iv) of this section will be deemed to have been met.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Citizen participation plan.</E> The public entity must develop and follow a detailed citizen participation plan and make the plan public. The plan must be completed and available before the application is submitted to HUD. The plan may be the citizen plan required for the consolidated plan, modified to include guaranteed loan funds. The public entity is not required to hold a separate public hearing for its consolidated plan and for the guaranteed loan funds to obtain citizens' views on community development and housing needs. The plan must set forth the public entity's policies and procedures for:</P>
                <P>(i) Giving citizens timely notice of local meetings and reasonable and timely access to local meetings, information, and records relating to the public entity's proposed and actual use of guaranteed loan funds, including, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(A) The amount of guaranteed loan funds expected to be made available for the coming year, including program income anticipated to be generated by the activities carried out with guaranteed loan funds;</P>
                <P>(B) The range of activities that may be undertaken with guaranteed loan funds;</P>
                <P>(C) The estimated amount of guaranteed loan funds (including program income derived therefrom) proposed to be used for activities that will benefit low and moderate income persons;</P>
                <P>(D) The proposed activities likely to result in displacement and the public entity's plans, consistent with the policies developed under § 570.606 for minimizing displacement of persons as a result of its proposed activities.</P>
                <P>(ii) Providing technical assistance to groups representative of persons of low and moderate income that request assistance in developing proposals. The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the public entity. Such assistance need not include the provision of funds to such groups.</P>
                <P>(iii) Holding a minimum of two public hearings, each at a different stage of the public entity's program, for the purpose of obtaining the views of citizens and formulating or responding to proposals and questions. Together the hearings must address community development and housing needs, development of proposed activities and review of program performance. At least one of these hearings must be held before submission of the application to obtain the views of citizens on community development and housing needs. Reasonable notice of the hearing must be provided and the hearing must be held at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with accommodation for the handicapped. The public entity must specify in its plan how it will meet the requirement for a hearing at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries.</P>
                <P>(iv) Meeting the needs of non-English speaking residents in the case of public hearings where a significant number of non-English speaking residents can reasonably be expected to participate.</P>
                <P>(v) Providing affected citizens with reasonable advance notice of, and opportunity to comment on, proposed activities not previously included in an application and activities which are proposed to be deleted or substantially changed in terms of purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries. The criteria the public entity will use to determine what constitutes a substantial change for this purpose must be described in the citizen participation plan.</P>
                <P>(vi) Responding to citizens' complaints and grievances, including the procedures that citizens must follow when submitting complaints and grievances. The public entity's policies and procedures must provide for timely written answers to written complaints and grievances within 15 working days of the receipt of the complaint, where practicable.</P>

                <P>(vii) Encouraging citizen participation, particularly by low and moderate income persons who reside in slum or <PRTPAGE P="141"/>blighted areas, and other areas in which guaranteed loan funds are proposed to be used.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission requirements.</E> An application for loan guarantee assistance may be submitted at any time. The application (or consolidated plan) shall be submitted to the appropriate HUD Office and shall be accompanied by the following:</P>

                <P>(ii) Its governing body has duly adopted or passed as an official act a resolution, motion or similar official action:</P>

                <P>(B) Authorizing such official representative to execute such documents as may be required in order to implement the application and issue debt obligations pursuant thereto (provided that the authorization required by this paragraph (B) may be given by the local governing body after submission of the application but prior to execution of the contract required by § 570.705(b);</P>
                <P>(iii) Before submission of its application to HUD, the public entity has:</P>
                <P>(A) Furnished citizens with information required by § 570.704(a)(2)(i);</P>
                <P>(B) Held at least one public hearing to obtain the views of citizens on community development and housing needs; and</P>

                <P>(v) The public entity will affirmatively further fair housing, and the guaranteed loan funds will be administered in compliance with:</P>

                <P>(A) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and</P>
                <P>(B) The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619).</P>
                <P>(vi)(A) (For entitlement public entities only.)

It lacks sufficient resources from funds provided under this subpart or program income to allow it to comply with the provisions of § 570.200(c)(2), and it must therefore assess properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons, to recover the guaranteed loan funded portion of the capital cost without paying such assessments in their behalf from guaranteed loan funds.</P>

                <P>(3) HUD may disapprove an application, or may approve loan guarantee assistance for an amount less than requested, for any of the following reasons:</P>
                <P>(i) HUD determines that the guarantee constitutes an unacceptable financial risk. Factors that will be considered in assessing financial risk shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(A) The length of the proposed repayment period;</P>

                <P>(iii) Funds are not available in the amount requested.</P>
                <P>(iv) The performance of the public entity, its designated public agency or State under this part is unacceptable.</P>
                <P>(v) Activities to be undertaken with the guaranteed loan funds are not eligible under § 570.703.</P>
                <P>(vi) Activities to be undertaken with the guaranteed loan funds do not meet the criteria in § 570.208 for compliance with one of the national objectives of the Act.</P>
                <P>(4) HUD will notify the public entity or State in writing that the loan guarantee request has either been approved, reduced, or disapproved. If the request is reduced or disapproved, the public entity or State shall be informed of the specific reasons for reduction or disapproval. If the request is reduced or disapproved, the public entity shall be informed of the specific reasons for reduction or disapproval. If the request is approved, HUD shall issue an offer of commitment to guarantee debt obligations of the borrower identified in the application subject to compliance with this part, including the requirements under § 570.705(b), (d), (g) and (h) for securing and issuing debt obligations, the conditions for release of funds described in paragraph (d) of this section, and such other conditions as HUD may specify in the commitment documents in a particular case.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Collection of fees; procedure to determine amount of the fee.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This section contains additional procedures for guarantees of debt obligations under section 108 when HUD is required or authorized to collect fees to pay the credit subsidy costs of the loan guarantee program.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Collection of fees.</E> HUD may collect fees from borrowers for the purpose of paying the credit subsidy cost of the loan guarantee. Each public entity or its designated public agency and each State issuing debt obligations under this subpart is responsible for the payment of any and all fees charged pursuant to this section. The fees are payable from the grant allocated to the issuer pursuant to the Act (including program income derived therefrom) or from other sources, but are only payable from guaranteed loan funds if the fee is deducted from the disbursement of guaranteed loan funds.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount and determination of fee.</E> (1) HUD shall calculate the amount of the fee as a percentage of the principal amount of the guaranteed loan as provided by this section, based on a determination that the fees when collected will reduce the credit subsidy cost to the amount established by applicable appropriation acts. The amount of the fee payable by the public entity or State shall be based on the date of the loan guarantee commitment and shall be determined by applying the percentages announced by <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice to guaranteed loan disbursements as they occur or periodically to outstanding principal balances, or both.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the fees required under paragraph (a) of this section, announcing the fee to be applied, the effective date of the fee, and any other necessary information regarding payment of the fee and, if necessary, provide a 30-day public comment period for the purpose of inviting comment on the proposed fee before adopting changes to the assumptions underlying the fee calculation or if the fee structure itself raises new considerations for Borrowers. HUD will publish a second <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, if necessary, after consideration of public comments.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Performance review authorities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Entitlement, Insular Areas, and HUD-administered Small Cities performance reviews.</E> Section 104(e)(1) of the Act requires that the Secretary shall, at least on an annual basis, make such reviews and audits as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether the recipient has carried out its activities in a timely manner, whether the recipient has carried out those activities and its certifications in accordance with the requirements and the primary objectives of the Act and with other applicable laws, and whether the recipient has a continuing capacity to carry out those activities in a timely manner.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) performance reviews.</E> Section 119(g) of the Act requires the Secretary, at least on an annual basis, to make such reviews and audits of recipients of Urban Development Action Grants as necessary to determine whether the recipient's progress in carrying out the approved activities is substantially in accordance with the recipient's approved plans and timetables.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance review procedures.</E> This paragraph describes the review procedures the Department will use in conducting the performance reviews required by sections 104(e) and 119(g) of the Act:</P>
                <P>(1) The Department will determine the performance of each entitlement, Insular Areas, and HUD-administered small cities recipient in accordance with section 104(e)(1) of the Act by reviewing for compliance with the requirements described in § 570.901 and by applying the performance criteria described in §§ 570.902 and 570.903 relative to carrying out activities in a timely manner. The review criteria in § 570.904 will be used to assist in determining if the recipient's program is being carried out in compliance with civil rights requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) The Department will review UDAG projects and activities to determine whether such projects and activities are being carried out substantially in accordance with the recipient's approved plans and schedules. The Department will also review to determine if the recipient has carried out its UDAG program in accordance with all other requirements of the Grant Agreement and with all applicable requirements of this part.</P>
                <P>(3) In conducting performance reviews, HUD will primarily rely on information obtained from the recipient's performance report, records maintained, findings from monitoring, grantee and subrecipient audits, audits and surveys conducted by the HUD Inspector General, and financial data regarding the amount of funds remaining in the line of credit plus program income. HUD may also consider relevant information pertaining to a recipient's performance gained from other sources, including litigation, citizen comments, and other information provided by or concerning the recipient. A recipient's failure to maintain records in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has failed to meet the applicable requirement to which the record pertains.</P>
                <P>(4) If HUD determines that a recipient has not met a civil rights review criterion in § 570.904, the recipient will be provided an opportunity to demonstrate that it has nonetheless met the applicable civil rights requirement.</P>
                <P>(5) If HUD finds that a recipient has failed to comply with a program requirement or has failed to meet a performance criterion in § 570.902 or § 570.903, HUD will give the recipient an opportunity to provide additional information concerning the finding.</P>
                <P>(6) If, after considering any additional information submitted by a recipient, HUD determines to uphold the finding, HUD may advise the recipient to undertake appropriate corrective or remedial actions as specified in § 570.910. HUD will consider the recipient's capacity as described in § 570.905 prior to selecting the corrective or remedial actions.</P>
                <P>(7) If the recipient fails to undertake appropriate corrective or remedial actions which resolve the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Secretary, the Secretary may impose a sanction pursuant to § 570.911, 570,912, or 570.913, as applicable.</P>

                <P>(i) Sixty days prior to the end of the grantee's current program year, the amount of entitlement grant funds available to the recipient under grant agreements but undisbursed by the U.S. Treasury is more than 1.5 times the entitlement grant amount for its current program year; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The grantee fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that the lack of timeliness has resulted from factors beyond the grantee's reasonable control.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding that the amount of funds in the line of credit indicates that the recipient is carrying out its activities in a timely manner pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, HUD may determine that the recipient is not carrying out its activities in a timely manner if:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount of CDBG program income the recipient has on hand 60 days prior to the end of its current program year, together with the amount of funds in its CDBG line of credit, exceeds 1.5 times the entitlement grant amount for its current program year; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The grantee fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that the lack of timeliness has resulted from factors beyond the grantee's reasonable control.</P>

                <P>(3) In determining the appropriate corrective action to take with respect to a HUD determination that a recipient is not carrying out its activities in a timely manner pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, HUD will consider the likelihood that <PRTPAGE P="150"/>the recipient will expend a sufficient amount of funds over the next program year to reduce the amount of unexpended funds to a level that will fall within the standard described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when HUD next measures the grantee's timeliness performance. For these purposes, HUD will take into account the extent to which funds on hand have been obligated by the recipient and its subrecipients for specific activities at the time the finding is made and other relevant information.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">HUD-administered Small Cities program in New York.</E> The Department will, absent substantial evidence to the contrary, deem a HUD-administered Small Cities recipient in New York to be carrying out its CDBG-funded activities in a timely manner if the schedule for carrying out its activities, as contained in the approved application (including any subsequent amendment(s)), is being substantially met.</P>

                <P>(ii) The grantee fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that the lack of timeliness has resulted from factors beyond the grantee's reasonable control.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding that the amount of funds in the line of credit indicates that the Insular Area recipient is carrying out its activities in a timely manner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, HUD may determine that the recipient is not carrying out its activities in a timely manner if:</P>
                <P>(i) The amount of CDBG program income the recipient has on hand 60 days prior to the end of its current program year, together with the amount of funds in its CDBG line of credit, exceeds 2.0 times the Insular Area's grant amount for its current program year; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The grantee fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that the lack of timeliness has resulted from factors beyond the grantee's reasonable control.</P>
                <P>(3) In determining the appropriate corrective action to take with respect to a HUD determination that a recipient is not carrying out its activities in a timely manner pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, HUD will consider the likelihood that the recipient will expend a sufficient amount of funds over the next program year to reduce the amount of unexpended funds to a level that will fall within the standards described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section when HUD next measures the grantee's timeliness performance. For these purposes, HUD will take into account the extent to which funds on hand have been obligated by the recipient and its sub-recipients for specific activities at the time the finding is made and other relevant information.</P>
                <P>(4) If a recipient is determined to be untimely pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section in one year, and the recipient is again determined to be untimely in the following year, HUD may reduce the recipient's next grant by 100 percent of the amount in excess of twice the Insular Area's most recent CDBG grant, unless HUD determines that the untimeliness resulted from factors outside of the grantee's reasonable control.</P>
                <P>(5) The first review under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section will take place 60 days prior to the conclusion of the Fiscal Year 2006 program year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Review to determine if the recipient is meeting its consolidated plan responsibilities.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The consolidated plan, action plan, and amendment submission requirements referred to in this section are in 24 CFR part 91. For the purpose of this section, the term consolidated plan includes an abbreviated consolidated plan that is submitted pursuant to 24 CFR 91.235.<PRTPAGE P="151"/>
                </P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Review timing and purpose.</E> HUD will review the consolidated plan performance of each entitlement, Insular Areas, and Hawaii HUD-administered Small Cities grant recipient prior to acceptance of a grant recipient's annual certification under 24 CFR 91.225(b)(3) to determine whether the recipient followed its HUD-approved consolidated plan for the most recently completed program year, and whether activities assisted with CDBG funds during that period were consistent with that consolidated plan, except that grantees are not bound by the consolidated plan with respect to the use or distribution of CDBG funds to meet non-housing community development needs.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Following a consolidated plan.</E> The recipient will be considered to be following its consolidated plan if it has taken all of the planned actions described in its action plan. This includes, but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Pursuing all resources that the grantee indicated it would pursue;</P>
                <P>(2) Providing certifications of consistency, when requested to do so by applicants for HUD programs for which the grantee indicated that it would support application by other entities, in a fair and impartial manner; and</P>
                <P>(3) Not hindering implementation of the consolidated plan by action or willful inaction.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Disapproval.</E> If HUD determines that a recipient has not met the criteria outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient and provide the recipient up to 45 days to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has followed its consolidated plan. HUD will consider all relevant circumstances and the recipient's actions and lack of actions affecting the provision of assistance covered by the consolidated plan within its jurisdiction. Failure to so demonstrate in a timely manner will be cause for HUD to find that the recipient has failed to meet its certification. A complete and specific response by the recipient shall describe:</P>
                <P>(1) Any factors beyond the control of the recipient that prevented it from following its consolidated plan, and any actions the recipient has taken or plans to take to alleviate such factors; and</P>
                <P>(2) Actions taken by the recipient, if any, beyond those described in the consolidated plan performance report to facilitate following the consolidated plan, including the effects of such actions.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">New York HUD-administered Small Cities.</E> New York HUD-administered grantees shall follow the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section for their abbreviated or full consolidated plan to the extent that the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are applicable. If the grantee does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and does not provide HUD with an acceptable explanation, HUD may decide, in accordance with the requirements of the notice of fund availability, that the grantee does not meet threshold requirements to apply for a new small cities grant.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Where the criteria in this section are met, the Department will presume that the recipient has carried out its CDBG-funded program in accordance with civil rights certifications and civil rights requirements of the Act relating to equal employment opportunity, equal opportunity in services, benefits and participation, and is affirmatively furthering fair housing unless:</P>
                <P>(i) There is evidence which shows, or from which it is reasonable to infer, that the recipient, motivated by considerations of race, color, religion where applicable, sex, national origin, age or handicap, has treated some persons less favorably than others, or</P>

                <P>(ii) There is evidence that a policy, practice, standard or method of administration, although neutral on its face, operates to deny or affect adversely in a significantly disparate way the provision of employment or services, benefits or participation to persons of a particular race, color, religion where applicable, sex, national origin, age or handicap, or fair housing to persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or<PRTPAGE P="152"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii) Where the Secretary required a further assurance pursuant to § 570.304 in order to accept the recipient's prior civil rights certification, the recipient has failed to meet any such assurance.</P>
                <P>(2) In such instances, or where the review criteria in this section are not met, the recipient will be afforded an opportunity to present evidence that it has not failed to carry out the civil rights certifications and fair housing requirements of the Act. The Secretary's determination of whether there has been compliance with the applicable requirements will be made based on a review of the recipient's performance, evidence submitted by the recipient, and all other available evidence. The Department may also initiate separate compliance reviews under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or section 109 of the Act.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Review for equal opportunity.</E> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 1, together with section 109 of the Act (see § 570.602), prohibit discrimination in any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this part.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Review for equal employment opportunity.</E> The Department will presume that a recipient's hiring and employment practices have been carried out in compliance with its equal opportunity certifications and requirements of the Act. This presumption may be rebutted where, based on the totality of circumstances, there has been a deprivation of employment, promotion, or training opportunities by a recipient to any person within the meaning of section 109. The extent to which persons of a particular race, gender, or ethnic background are represented in the workforce may in certain circumstances be considered, together with complaints, performance reviews, and other information.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Review of equal opportunity in services, benefits and participation.</E> The Department will presume a recipient is carrying out its programs and activities in accordance with the civil rights certifications and requirements of the Act. This presumption may be rebutted where, based on the totality of circumstances, there has been a deprivation of services, benefits, or participation in any program or activity funded in whole or in part with block grant funds by a recipient to any person within the meaning of section 109. The extent to which persons of a particular race, gender, or ethnic background participate in a program or activity may in certain circumstances be considered, together with complaints, performance reviews, and other information.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Review for fair housing</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> See the requirements in the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-20), as well as § 570.601(a).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Affirmatively furthering fair housing.</E> HUD will review a recipient's performance to determine if it has administered all programs and activities related to housing and urban development in accordance with § 570.601(a)(2), which sets forth the grantee's responsibility to affirmatively further fair housing.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Actions to use minority and women's business firms.</E> The Department will review a recipient's performance to determine if it has administered its activities funded with assistance under this part in a manner to encourage use of minority and women's business enterprises described in Executive Orders 11625, 12432 and 12138, and 2 CFR 200.321. In making this review, the Department will determine if the grantee has taken actions required under 2 CFR 200.321, and will review the effectiveness of those actions in accomplishing the objectives of 2 CFR 200.321 and the Executive Orders. No recipient is required by this part to attain or maintain any particular statistical level of participation in its contracting activities by race, ethnicity, or gender of the contractor's owners or managers.</P>

                <EAR>Pt. 570, App. A</EAR>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 570—Guidelines and Objectives for Evaluating Project Costs and Financial Requirements</HD>
                <P>I. <E T="03">Guidelines and Objectives for Evaluating Project Costs and Financial Requirements.</E> HUD has developed the following guidelines that are designed to provide the recipient with a framework for financially underwriting and selecting CDBG-assisted economic development projects which are financially viable and will make the most effective use of the CDBG funds. <E T="03">The use of these underwriting guidelines as published by HUD is not mandatory.</E> However, grantees electing not to use these underwriting guidelines would be expected to conduct basic financial underwriting prior to the provision of CDBG financial assistance to a for-profit business. States electing not to use these underwriting guidelines would be expected to ensure that the state or units of general local government conduct basic financial underwriting prior to the provision of CDBG financial assistance to a for-profit business.</P>
                <P>II. Where appropriate, HUD's underwriting guidelines recognize that different levels of review are appropriate to take into account differences in the size and scope of a proposed project, and in the case of a microenterprise or other small business to take into account the differences in the capacity and level of sophistication among businesses of differing sizes.</P>
                <P>III. Recipients are encouraged, when they develop their own programs and underwriting criteria, to also take these factors into account. For example, a recipient administering a program providing only technical assistance to small businesses might choose to apply underwriting guidelines to the technical assistance program as a whole, rather than to each instance of assistance to a business. Given the nature and dollar value of such a program, a recipient might choose to limit its evaluation to factors such as the extent of need for this type of assistance by the target group of businesses and the extent to which this type of assistance is already available.</P>
                <P>IV. The objectives of the underwriting guidelines are to ensure:</P>
                <P>(1) that project costs are reasonable;</P>
                <P>(2) that all sources of project financing are committed;</P>
                <P>(3) that to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are not substituted for non-Federal financial support;</P>
                <P>(4) that the project is financially feasible;</P>
                <P>(5) that to the extent practicable, the return on the owner's equity investment will not be unreasonably high; and</P>
                <P>(6) that to the extent practicable, CDBG funds are disbursed on a pro rata basis with other finances provided to the project.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">i. Project costs are reasonable.</E> i. Reviewing costs for reasonableness is important. It will help the recipient avoid providing either too much or too little CDBG assistance for the proposed project. Therefore, it is suggested that the grantee obtain a breakdown of all project costs and that each cost element making up the project be reviewed for reasonableness. The amount of time and resources the recipient expends evaluating the reasonableness of a cost element should be commensurate with its cost. For example, it would be appropriate for an experienced reviewer looking at a cost element of less than $10,000 to judge the reasonableness of that cost based upon his or her knowledge and common sense. For a cost element in excess of $10,000, it would be more appropriate for the reviewer to compare the cost element with a third-party, fair-market price quotation for that cost element. Third-party price quotations may also be used by a reviewer to help determine the reasonableness of cost elements below $10,000 when the reviewer evaluates projects infrequently or if the reviewer is less experienced in cost estimations. If a recipient does not use third-party price quotations to verify cost elements, then the recipient would need to conduct its own cost analysis using appropriate cost estimating manuals or services.</P>
                <P>ii. The recipient should pay particular attention to any cost element of the project that will be carried out through a non-arms-length transaction. A non-arms-length transaction occurs when the entity implementing the CDBG assisted activity procures goods or services from itself or from another party with whom there is a financial interest or family relationship. If abused, non-arms-length transactions misrepresent the true cost of the project.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Commitment of all project sources of financing.</E> The recipient should review all projected sources of financing necessary to carry out the economic development project. This is to ensure that time and effort is not wasted on assessing a proposal that is not able to proceed. To the extent practicable, prior to the commitment of CDBG funds to the project, the recipient should verify that: sufficient sources of funds have been identified to finance the project; all participating parties <PRTPAGE P="158"/>providing those funds have affirmed their intention to make the funds available; and the participating parties have the financial capacity to provide the funds.</P>
                <P>3. <E T="03">Avoid substitution of CDBG funds for non-Federal financial support.</E> i. The recipient should review the economic development project to ensure that, to the extent practicable, CDBG funds will not be used to substantially reduce the amount of non-Federal financial support for the activity. This will help the recipient to make the most efficient use of its CDBG funds for economic development. To reach this determination, the recipient's reviewer would conduct a financial underwriting analysis of the project, including reviews of appropriate projections of revenues, expenses, debt service and returns on equity investments in the project. The extent of this review should be appropriate for the size and complexity of the project and should use industry standards for similar projects, taking into account the unique factors of the project such as risk and location.</P>
                <P>ii. Because of the high cost of underwriting and processing loans, many private financial lenders do not finance commercial projects that are less than $100,000. A recipient should familiarize itself with the lending practices of the financial institutions in its community. If the project's total cost is one that would normally fall within the range that financial institutions participate, then the recipient should normally determine the following:</P>
                <P>A. <E T="03">Private debt financing</E>—whether or not the participating private, for-profit business (or other entity having an equity interest) has applied for private debt financing from a commercial lending institution and whether that institution has completed all of its financial underwriting and loan approval actions resulting in either a firm commitment of its funds or a decision not to participate in the project; and</P>
                <P>B. <E T="03">Equity participation</E>—whether or not the degree of equity participation is reasonable given general industry standards for rates of return on equity for similar projects with similar risks and given the financial capacity of the entrepreneur(s) to make additional financial investments.</P>
                <P>iii. If the recipient is assisting a microenterprise owned by a low- or moderate-income person(s), in conducting its review under this paragraph, the recipient might only need to determine that non-Federal sources of financing are not available (at terms appropriate for such financing) in the community to serve the low- or moderate-income entrepreneur.</P>
                <P>4. <E T="03">Financial feasibility of the project.</E> i. The public benefit a grantee expects to derive from the CDBG assisted project (the subject of separate regulatory standards) will not materialize if the project is not financially feasible. To determine if there is a reasonable chance for the project's success, the recipient should evaluate the financial viability of the project. A project would be considered financially viable if all of the assumptions about the project's market share, sales levels, growth potential, projections of revenue, project expenses and debt service (including repayment of the CDBG assistance if appropriate) were determined to be realistic and met the project's break-even point (which is generally the point at which all revenues are equal to all expenses). Generally speaking, an economic development project that does not reach this break-even point over time is not financially feasible. The following should be noted in this regard:</P>
                <P>A. some projects make provisions for a negative cash flow in the early years of the project while space is being leased up or sales volume built up, but the project's projections should take these factors into account and provide sources of financing for such negative cash flow; and</P>
                <P>B. it is expected that a financially viable project will also project sufficient revenues to provide a reasonable return on equity investment. The recipient should carefully examine any project that is not economically able to provide a reasonable return on equity investment. Under such circumstances, a business may be overstating its real equity investment (actual costs of the project may be overstated as well), or it may be overstating some of the project's operating expenses in the expectation that the difference will be taken out as profits, or the business may be overly pessimistic in its market share and revenue projections and has downplayed its profits.</P>
                <P>ii. In addition to the financial underwriting reviews carried out earlier, the recipient should evaluate the experience and capacity of the assisted business owners to manage an assisted business to achieve the projections. Based upon its analysis of these factors, the recipient should identify those elements, if any, that pose the greatest risks contributing to the project's lack of financial feasibility.</P>
                <P>5. <E T="03">Return on equity investment.</E> To the extent practicable, the CDBG assisted activity should provide not more than a reasonable return on investment to the owner of the assisted activity. This will help ensure that the grantee is able to maximize the use of its CDBG funds for its economic development objectives. However, care should also be taken to avoid the situation where the owner is likely to receive too small a return on his/her investment, so that his/her motivation remains high to pursue the business with vigor. The amount, type and terms of the CDBG assistance should be adjusted to allow the owner a reasonable return on his/her investment given industry rates of return for that investment, local conditions and the risk of the project.<PRTPAGE P="159"/>
                </P>
                <P>6. <E T="03">Disbursement of CDBG funds on a pro rata basis.</E> To the extent practicable, CDBG funds used to finance economic development activities should be disbursed on a pro rata basis with other funding sources. Recipients should be guided by the principle of not placing CDBG funds at significantly greater risk than non-CDBG funds. This will help avoid the situation where it is learned that a problem has developed that will block the completion of the project, even though all or most of the CDBG funds going in to the project have already been expended. When this happens, a recipient may be put in a position of having to provide additional financing to complete the project or watch the potential loss of its funds if the project is not able to be completed. When the recipient determines that it is not practicable to disburse CDBG funds on a pro rata basis, the recipient should consider taking other steps to safeguard CDBG funds in the event of a default, such as insisting on securitizing assets of the project.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Environmental procedures and standards.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The environmental review requirements at 24 CFR part 50 are applicable to this part.<PRTPAGE P="162"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Environmental procedures.</E> Before any lender's submission requesting a loan guarantee for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of real property can be selected for a loan guarantee, HUD shall determine whether any environmental thresholds are exceeded in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, which implements the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the related Federal environmental laws and authorities listed under 24 CFR 50.4. To assist in complying with environmental requirements, Borrowers are encouraged to select sites that are free of environmental hazards and are to provide HUD with environmental data needed to make a determination of compliance. For successful Borrowers, the costs for preparing the environmental data are eligible as project costs.</P>
              <P>(1) If HUD determines that one or more of the thresholds are exceeded, HUD shall conduct a compliance review of the issue and, if appropriate, establish mitigating measures that the applicant shall carry out for the property.</P>
              <P>(2) The lender's submissions under § 573.6 shall provide HUD with:</P>
              <P>(i) Documentation for environmental threshold review; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any previously issued environmental reviews prepared by local, State, or other Federal agencies for the proposed property.</P>
              <P>(3) In providing the above information, the Borrower is encouraged to contact the local community development agency to obtain any previously issued environmental reviews for the proposed property as well as for other relevant information that can be used in the applicant documentation for the environmental threshold review.</P>
              <P>(4) HUD reserves the right to disqualify any request where one or more environmental thresholds are exceeded if HUD determines that the compliance review cannot be satisfactorily completed.</P>
              <P>(5) If Guaranteed Loan Funds are requested for acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction, Borrowers and Financial Institutions are prohibited from committing or expending State, local, or other funds to undertake property acquisition, rehabilitation or construction under this part until HUD issues a letter of commitment notifying the lender of HUD approval of the loan guarantee.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental thresholds.</E> HUD shall determine whether a NEPA environmental assessment is required. Also, HUD shall determine whether the proposed property triggers thresholds for the applicable Federal environmental laws and authorities listed under 24 CFR 50.4 as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For minor rehabilitation of a building and acquisition of any property, Federal environmental laws and authorities may apply when the property is:</P>

              <P>(2) For major rehabilitation of a building or for new construction or rebuilding, and environmental assessment under NEPA is required and, in addition to paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, other Federal environmental laws and authorities may apply when the property:</P>
              <P>(i) Affects coastal zone management;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is located near hazardous industrial operations handling fuels or chemicals of an explosive or flammable nature;</P>
              <P>(iii) Affects a sole source aquifer;</P>

              <P>(v) Is located within a designated wetland; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Is located in a high noise area.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualified data sources.</E> The environmental threshold information provided by applicants mut be from qualified data sources. A qualified data source means any Federal, State, or local agency with expertise or experience in environmental protection (e.g., <PRTPAGE P="163"/>the local community development agency; the local planning agency; the State environmental protection agency; or the State Historic Preservation Officer) or any other source qualified to provide reliable information on the particular property.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Minor rehabilitation means proposed fixing and repairs:</P>
              <P>(1) Whose estimated cost is less than 75 percent of the estimated cost of replacement after completion;</P>
              <P>(2) That does not involve changes in land use from residential to nonresidential, or from nonresidential to residential; and</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of residential properties, that does not increase density more than 20 percent.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Project consultants.</E> In achieving compliance with these procedures, Borrower's architectural and engineering consultants shall consider these environmental factors and provide information in their plan narratives as to how their construction plans conform with the above environmental factors. To facilitate HUD's compliance with part 50, the Borrower is required to submit the consultant's information and plan narrative discussing the pertinent environmental factors under this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Formula allocations.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Data sources.</E> HUD will allocate funds based on the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, and on population data provided by the U.S. Census. The number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome used for this purpose shall be the number reported as of March 31 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the amounts are appropriated and allocated.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Distribution of appropriated funds for entitlement awards.</E> (1) Seventy-five percent of the funds allocated under the formula is distributed to qualifying cities and eligible States, as described in § 574.100, based on each metropolitan statistical area's or State's proportionate share of the cumulative number of AIDS cases in all eligible metropolitan statistical areas and eligible States.</P>
                <P>(2) The remaining twenty-five percent is allocated among qualifying cities, but not States, where the per capita incidence of AIDS for the year, April 1 through March 31, preceding the fiscal year of the appropriation is higher than the average for all metropolitan statistical areas with more than 500,000 population. Each qualifying city's allocation reflects its EMSA's proportionate share of the high incidence factor among EMSA's with higher than average per capita incidence of AIDS. The high incidence factor is computed by multiplying the population of the metropolitan statistical area by the difference between its twelve-month-per-capita-incidence rate and the average rate for all metropolitan statistical areas with more than 500,000 population. The EMSA's proportionate share is determined by dividing its high incidence factor by the sum of the high incidence factors for all EMSA's with higher than average per capita incidence of AIDS.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum grant.</E> No grant awarded under paragraph (b) of this section shall be less than $200,000. Therefore, if <PRTPAGE P="167"/>the calculations under paragraph (b) of this section would result in any eligible metropolitan statistical area or eligible State receiving less than $200,000, the amount allocated to that entity is increased to $200,000 and allocations to entities in excess of $200,000 are proportionately reduced by the amount of the increase.</P>

Appropriate supportive services, as required by § 574.310(a), must be provided as part of any HOPWA assisted housing, but HOPWA funds may also be used to provide services independently of any housing activity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Activities.</E> The following activities may be carried out with HOPWA funds:</P>

Housing counseling, as defined in § 5.100, that is funded with or provided in connection with HOPWA funds must be carried out in accordance with § 5.111. When grantees provide housing services to eligible persons (including persons undergoing relocation) that are incidental to a larger set of holistic case management services, these services do not meet the definition of Housing counseling, as defined in § 5.100, and therefore are not required to be carried out in accordance with the certification requirements of § 5.111;</P>
                <P>(2) Resource identification to establish, coordinate and develop housing assistance resources for eligible persons (including conducting preliminary research and making expenditures necessary to determine the feasibility of specific housing-related initiatives);</P>

                <P>(4) New construction (for single room occupancy (SRO) dwellings and community residences only).</P>
                <P>(5) Project- or tenant-based rental assistance, including assistance for shared housing arrangements;</P>

                <P>(7) Supportive services including, but not limited to, health, mental health, assessment, permanent housing placement, drug and alcohol abuse treatment and counseling, day care, personal assistance, nutritional services, intensive care when required, and assistance in gaining access to local, State, and Federal government benefits and services, except that health services may only be provided to individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or related diseases and not to family members of these individuals;</P>
                <P>(8) Operating costs for housing including maintenance, security, operation, insurance, utilities, furnishings, equipment, supplies, and other incidental costs;</P>
                <P>(9) Technical assistance in establishing and operating a community residence, including planning and other pre-development or pre-construction expenses and including, but not limited to, costs relating to community outreach and educational activities regarding AIDS or related diseases for persons residing in proximity to the community residence;</P>

                <P>(i) Each grantee may use not more than 3 percent of the grant amount for its own administrative costs relating to administering grant amounts and allocating such amounts to project sponsors; and</P>

                <P>(ii) Each project sponsor receiving amounts from grants made under this <PRTPAGE P="169"/>program may use not more than 7 percent of the amounts received for administrative costs.</P>

                <P>(A) Sets a policy for determining the “reasonable grace period” for remaining persons residing in the unit to establish eligibility for HOPWA assistance or find alternative housing, which period shall be no less than 90 calendar days nor more than one year from the date of bifurcation of a lease, consistent with 24 CFR 574.460;</P>
                <P>(B) Provides notice of occupancy rights and the certification form at the times listed in paragraph (d) of this section;</P>

                <P>(ii)(A) If a tenant seeks VAWA protections, set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, the tenant must submit such request through the project sponsor (or the grantee if the grantee is directly administering HOPWA assistance). Grantees and project sponsors will work with the housing or facility owner or manager to facilitate protections on the tenant's behalf. Project sponsors must follow the documentation specifications in 24 CFR 5.2007, including the confidentiality requirements in 24 CFR 5.2007(c).</P>
                <P>(B) The grantee or project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the housing or facility owner or manager develops and uses a HOPWA lease addendum with VAWA protections and is made aware of the option to bifurcate a lease in accordance with § 574.460 and 24 CFR 5.2009.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) For tenant-based rental assistance, the HOPWA grantee is responsible for ensuring that each project sponsor providing tenant-based rental assistance undertakes the following actions (or, if administering the HOPWA assistance directly, the grantee shall undertake the following actions):</P>
                <P>(A) Sets policy for determining the “reasonable grace period” for remaining persons residing in the unit to establish eligibility for HOPWA assistance or find alternative housing, which period shall be no less than 90 calendar days and no more than one year from the date of bifurcation of a lease, consistent with 24 CFR 574.460;</P>

                <P>(ii)(A) If a tenant seeks VAWA protections set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, the tenant must submit such request through the project sponsor (or the grantee if the grantee is directly administering HOPWA assistance). The project sponsor will work with the housing owner or manager to facilitate protections on the tenant's behalf. Project sponsors must follow the documentation specifications in 24 CFR 5.2007, including the confidentiality requirements in 24 CFR 5.2007(c). The project sponsor (or the grantee if the grantee is directly administering HOPWA assistance) is also responsible for determining on a case-by-case basis whether to provide new tenant-based rental assistance to a remaining tenant if lease bifurcation or an emergency transfer results in division of the household.</P>
                <P>(B) The grantee or project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the housing owner or manager develops and uses a HOPWA lease addendum with VAWA protections and is made aware of the option to bifurcate a lease in accordance with § 574.460 and 24 CFR 5.2009.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification requirements.</E> (1) As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the grantee is responsible for ensuring that the notice of occupancy rights and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) is provided to each person receiving project-based or tenant-based rental assistance under HOPWA or residing in rental housing assisted under the eligible activities described in § 574.604(a) at the following times:</P>
                <P>(i) At the time the person is denied rental assistance or admission to a HOPWA-assisted unit;</P>
                <P>(ii) At the time the person is admitted to a HOPWA-assisted unit or is provided rental assistance;</P>
                <P>(iii) With any notification of eviction from the HOPWA-assisted unit or notification of termination of rental assistance; and</P>
                <P>(iv) During the 12-month period following December 16, 2016, either during annual recertification or lease renewal, whichever is applicable, or, if there will be no recertification or lease renewal for a tenant during the first year after the rule takes effect, through other means.</P>
                <P>(2) The grantee is responsible for ensuring that, for each tenant receiving HOPWA tenant-based rental assistance, the owner or manager of the tenant's housing unit commits to provide the notice of occupancy rights and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005 with any notification of eviction that the owner or manager provides to the tenant during the period for which the tenant is receiving HOPWA tenant-based rental assistance. This commitment, as well as the confidentiality requirements under 24 CFR 5.2007(c), must be set forth in the VAWA lease term/addendum required under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Definition of reasonable time.</E> For the purpose of 24 CFR 5.2009(b), the reasonable time to establish eligibility or find alternative housing following bifurcation of a lease is the reasonable grace period described in § 574.460.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">VAWA lease term/addendum.</E> As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the grantee or project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the housing or facility owner or manager, as applicable, develops and uses a VAWA lease term/addendum to incorporate all requirements that apply to the housing or facility owner or manager under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and this section, <PRTPAGE P="178"/>including the prohibited bases for eviction under 24 CFR 5.2005(b), the provisions regarding construction of lease terms and terms of assistance under 24 CFR 5.2005(c), and the confidentiality of documentation submitted by tenants requesting emergency transfers and of each tenant's housing location consistent with 24 CFR 5.2007(c). The VAWA lease term/addendum must also provide that the tenant may terminate the lease without penalty if a determination is made that the tenant has met the conditions for an emergency transfer under 24 CFR 5.2005(e). The grantee or project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the housing or facility owner, or manager, as applicable, adds the VAWA lease term/addendum to the leases for all HOPWA-assisted units and the leases for all eligible persons receiving HOPWA tenant-based rental assistance.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions: Threshold requirements.</E> Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HOPWA program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's program or project. An exception may be considered only after the recipient has provided the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>

                <P>(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant moves after the “initiation of negotiations” and the move occurs before the tenant has been provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant's monthly rent before the initiation of negotiations and estimated average utility costs, or</P>

                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
                <P>(C) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
                <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation or applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purposes of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance provided under this section), if the project is approved;</P>
                <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
                <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
                <P>(3) The grantee or project sponsor may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>

                <P>(4) <E T="03">Utility deposits.</E> ESG funds may pay for a standard utility deposit required by the utility company for all customers for the utilities listed in paragraph (5) of this section.</P>

A partial payment of a utility bill counts as one month. This assistance may only be provided if the program participant or a member of the same household has an account in his or her name with a utility company or proof of responsibility to make utility payments. Eligible utility services are gas, electric, water, and sewage. No program participant shall receive more than 24 months of utility assistance within any 3-year period.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Moving costs.</E> ESG funds may pay for moving costs, such as truck rental or hiring a moving company. This assistance may include payment of temporary storage fees for up to 3 months, provided that the fees are accrued after the date the program participant begins receiving assistance under paragraph (b) of this section and before the program participant moves into permanent housing. Payment of temporary storage fees in arrears is not eligible.</P>
                <P>(7) If a program participant receiving short- or medium-term rental assistance under § 576.106 meets the conditions for an emergency transfer under 24 CFR 5.2005(e), ESG funds may be used to pay amounts owed for breaking a lease to effect an emergency transfer. These costs are not subject to the 24-month limit on rental assistance under § 576.106.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Services costs.</E> Subject to the general restrictions under § 576.103 and § 576.104, ESG funds may be used to pay the costs of providing the following services:</P>

This assistance cannot exceed 30 days during the period the program participant is seeking permanent housing and cannot exceed 24 months during the period the program participant is living in permanent housing. Component services and activities consist of:</P>

                <P>(5) <E T="03">Credit repair.</E> ESG funds may pay for credit counseling and other services necessary to assist program participants with critical skills related to household budgeting, managing money, accessing a free personal credit report, and resolving personal credit problems.

However, except for housing stability case management, the total period for which any program participant may receive the services under paragraph (b) of this section must not exceed 24 months during any 3-year period. The limits on the assistance under this section apply to the total assistance an individual receives, either as an individual or as part of a family.</P>

When recipients or subrecipients provide housing services to eligible persons that are incidental to a larger set of holistic case management services, these services do not meet the definition of housing counseling, as defined in § 5.100, and therefore are not required to be carried out in accordance with the certification requirements of § 5.111</P>

                <SUBJECT>Short-term and medium-term rental assistance.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> Subject to the general conditions under § 576.103 and § 576.104, the recipient or subrecipient may provide a program participant with up to 24 months of rental assistance during any 3-year period. This assistance may be short-term rental assistance, medium-term rental assistance, payment of rental arrears, or any combination of this assistance.</P>
                <P>(1) Short-term rental assistance is assistance for up to 3 months of rent.</P>
                <P>(2) Medium-term rental assistance is assistance for more than 3 months but not more than 24 months of rent.</P>
                <P>(3) Payment of rental arrears consists of a one-time payment for up to 6 months of rent in arrears, including any late fees on those arrears.</P>
                <P>(4) Rental assistance may be tenant-based or project-based, as set forth in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Discretion to set caps and conditions.</E> Subject to the requirements of this section, the recipient may set a maximum amount or percentage of <PRTPAGE P="193"/>rental assistance that a program participant may receive, a maximum number of months that a program participant may receive rental assistance, or a maximum number of times that a program participant may receive rental assistance. The recipient may also require program participants to share in the costs of rent.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Use with other subsidies.</E> Except for a one-time payment of rental arrears on the tenant's portion of the rental payment, rental assistance cannot be provided to a program participant who is receiving tenant-based rental assistance, or living in a housing unit receiving project-based rental assistance or operating assistance, through other public sources. Rental assistance may not be provided to a program participant who has been provided with replacement housing payments under the URA during the period of time covered by the URA payments.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Rent restrictions.</E> (1) Rental assistance cannot be provided unless the rent does not exceed the Fair Market Rent established by HUD, as provided under 24 CFR part 888, and complies with HUD's standard of rent reasonableness, as established under 24 CFR 982.507.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of calculating rent under this section, the rent shall equal the sum of the total monthly rent for the unit, any fees required for occupancy under the lease (other than late fees and pet fees) and, if the tenant pays separately for utilities, the monthly allowance for utilities (excluding telephone) established by the public housing authority for the area in which the housing is located.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Rental assistance agreement.</E> The recipient or subrecipient may make rental assistance payments only to an owner with whom the recipient or subrecipient has entered into a rental assistance agreement. The rental assistance agreement must set forth the terms under which rental assistance will be provided, including the requirements that apply under this section. The rental assistance agreement must provide that, during the term of the agreement, the owner must give the recipient or subrecipient a copy of any notice to the program participant to vacate the housing unit or any complaint used under State or local law to commence an eviction action against the program participant. Each rental assistance agreement that is executed or renewed on or after <E T="03">December 16, 2016</E> must include all protections that apply to tenants and applicants under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, as supplemented by § 576.409, except for the emergency transfer plan requirements under 24 CFR 5.2005(e) and 576.409(d). If the housing is not assisted under another “covered housing program”, as defined in 24 CFR 5.2003, the agreement may provide that the owner's obligations under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), expire at the end of the rental assistance period.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Late payments.</E> The recipient or subrecipient must make timely payments to each owner in accordance with the rental assistance agreement. The rental assistance agreement must contain the same payment due date, grace period, and late payment penalty requirements as the program participant's lease. The recipient or subrecipient is solely responsible for paying late payment penalties that it incurs with non-ESG funds.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Lease.</E> Each program participant receiving rental assistance must have a legally binding, written lease for the rental unit, unless the assistance is solely for rental arrears. The lease must be between the owner and the program participant. Where the assistance is solely for rental arrears, an oral agreement may be accepted in place of a written lease, if the agreement gives the program participant an enforceable leasehold interest under state law and the agreement and rent owed are sufficiently documented by the owner's financial records, rent ledgers, or canceled checks. For program participants living in housing with project-based rental assistance under paragraph (i) of this section, the lease must have an initial term of 1 year. Each lease executed on or after <E T="03">December 16, 2016</E> must include a lease provision or incorporate a lease addendum that includes all requirements that apply to tenants, the owner or lease under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic <PRTPAGE P="194"/>Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), as supplemented by 24 CFR 576.409, including the prohibited bases for eviction and restrictions on construing lease terms under 24 CFR 5.2005(b) and (c). If the housing is not assisted under another “covered housing program,” as defined in 24 CFR 5.2003, the lease provision or lease addendum may be written to expire at the end of the rental assistance period.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Tenant-based rental assistance.</E> (1) A program participant who receives tenant-based rental assistance may select a housing unit in which to live and may move to another unit or building and continue to receive rental assistance, as long as the program participant continues to meet the program requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) The recipient may require that all program participants live within a particular area for the period in which the rental assistance is provided.</P>
                <P>(3) The rental assistance agreement with the owner must terminate and no further rental assistance payments under that agreement may be made if:</P>
                <P>(i) The program participant moves out of the housing unit for which the program participant has a lease;</P>
                <P>(ii) The lease terminates and is not renewed; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The program participant becomes ineligible to receive ESG rental assistance.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Project-based rental assistance.</E> If the recipient or subrecipient identifies a permanent housing unit that meets ESG requirements and becomes available before a program participant is identified to lease the unit, the recipient or subrecipient may enter into a rental assistance agreement with the owner to reserve the unit and subsidize its rent in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) The rental assistance agreement may cover one or more permanent housing units in the same building. Each unit covered by the rental assistance agreement (“assisted unit”) may only be occupied by program participants, except as provided under paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The recipient or subrecipient may pay up to 100 percent of the first month's rent, provided that a program participant signs a lease and moves into the unit before the end of the month for which the first month's rent is paid. The rent paid before a program participant moves into the unit must not exceed the rent to be charged under the program participant's lease and must be included when determining that program participant's total rental assistance.</P>

                <P>(3) The recipient or subrecipient may make monthly rental assistance payments only for each whole or partial month an assisted unit is leased to a program participant. When a program participant moves out of an assisted unit, the recipient or subrecipient may pay the next month's rent, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the first month's rent for a new program participant, as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) The program participant's lease must not condition the term of occupancy to the provision of rental assistance payments. If the program participant is determined ineligible or reaches the maximum number of months over which rental assistance can be provided, the recipient or subrecipient must suspend or terminate the rental assistance payments for the unit. If the payments are suspended, the individual or family may remain in the assisted unit as permitted under the lease, and the recipient or subrecipient may resume payments if the individual or family again becomes eligible and needs further rental assistance. If the payments are terminated, the rental assistance may be transferred to another available unit in the same building, provided that the other unit meets all ESG requirements.</P>

                <P>(5) The rental assistance agreement must have an initial term of one year. When a new program participant moves into an assisted unit, the term of the rental assistance agreement may be extended to cover the initial term of the program participant's lease. If the program participant's lease is renewed, the rental assistance agreement may be renewed or extended, as needed, up to the maximum number of months for which the program participant remains eligible. However, under no circumstances may the recipient or subrecipient commit ESG funds to be expended beyond the expenditure deadline in § 576.203 or commit funds for a <PRTPAGE P="195"/>future ESG grant before the grant is awarded.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Changes in household composition.</E> The limits on the assistance under this section apply to the total assistance an individual receives, either as an individual or as part of a family.</P>

As provided under 2 CFR 200.207, HUD may impose special conditions or restrictions on a grant, if the recipient is determined to be high risk.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> The recipient must amend its approved consolidated plan in order to make a change in its allocation priorities; make a change in its method of distributing funds; carry out an activity not previously described in the plan; or change the purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries of an activity. The amendment must be completed and submitted to HUD in accordance with the requirements under 24 CFR 91.505.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Matching requirement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The recipient must make matching contributions to supplement the recipient's ESG program in an amount that equals the recipient's fiscal year grant for ESG. This amount may include contributions to any project under the recipient's ESG program, including any subrecipient's ESG project, if the requirements in this section are met. The first $100,000 of a State's fiscal year grant is not required to be matched, but the benefit of this exception must pass to the state's subrecipients that are least capable of providing matching contributions. The match requirements under this section do not apply if the recipient is a territory.</P>
                <P>(b) To be recognized as match for ESG, each contribution must meet the requirements under 2 CFR 200.306, except that:</P>
                <P>(1) Notwithstanding 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4), matching contributions are not subject to the expenditure limits in § 576.100; and</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding 2 CFR 200.306(b)(5), the recipient may use funds from another Federal program as match for ESG, unless doing so would violate a specific statutory prohibition or the recipient or subrecipient counts ESG funds as match for that program.</P>
                <P>(c) The recipient may count as match the value specified in 2 CFR 200.306(d) for any building the recipient or subrecipient donates for long-term use in the recipient's ESG program, provided that depreciation on the building is not counted as match or charged to any Federal award. If a third party donates a building to the recipient or subrecipient, the recipient may count as match either depreciation of the building and fair rental charges for the land for each year the building is used for the recipient's ESG program or, if the building is donated for long-term use in the recipient's ESG program, the fair market value of the capital assets, as specified in 2 CFR 200.306(h)(2), (i), and (j). To qualify as a donation for long-term use, the donation must be evidenced by a recorded deed or use restriction that is effective for at least 10 years after the donation date. If the donated building is renovated with ESG funds, the minimum period of use under § 576.102(c) may increase the period for which the building must be used in the recipient's ESG program.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligible types of matching contributions.</E> The matching requirement may be met by one or both of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Cash contributions.</E> Cash expended for allowable costs, as defined in OMB Circulars A-87 (2 CFR part 225) and A-122 (2 CFR part 230), of the recipient or subrecipient.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Noncash contributions.</E> The value of any real property, equipment, goods, or services contributed to the recipient's or subrecipient's ESG program, provided that if the recipient or subrecipient had to pay for them with grant funds, the costs would have been allowable. Noncash contributions may also include the purchase value of any donated building.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculating the amount of noncash contributions.</E> (1) To determine the value of any donated material or building, or of any lease, the recipient must use a method reasonably calculated to establish the fair market value.</P>

                <P>(2) Services provided by individuals must be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the recipient's or subrecipient's organization. If the recipient or subrecipient does not have employees performing similar work, the rates must be consistent with those ordinarily <PRTPAGE P="198"/>paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market.</P>
                <P>(3) Some noncash contributions are real property, equipment, goods, or services that, if the recipient or subrecipient had to pay for them with grant funds, the payments would have been indirect costs. Matching credit for these contributions must be given only if the recipient or subrecipient has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of those contributions.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Costs paid by program income.</E> Costs paid by program income shall count toward meeting the recipient's matching requirements, provided the costs are eligible ESG costs that supplement the recipient's ESG program.</P>

If the recipient is a State, and has been identified as the HMIS lead by the Continuum of Care, the State may use funds to carry out HMIS activities set forth in § 576.107(a)(2). The recipient must subgrant the remaining funds in its fiscal year grant to:</P>
                <P>(1) Units of general purpose local government in the State, which may include metropolitan cities and urban counties that receive ESG funds directly from HUD; or</P>
                <P>(2) Private nonprofit organizations, provided that for emergency shelter activities the recipient obtains a certification of approval from the unit of general purpose local government for the geographic area in which those activities are to be carried out.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Recipients other than States; subrecipients.</E> The recipient, if it is not a State, and all subrecipients may carry out all eligible activities through their employees, procurement contracts, or subgrants to private nonprofit organizations. If the recipient is an urban county, it may carry out activities through any of its member governments, so long as the county applies to its members the same requirements that are applicable to local government subrecipients under this part.</P>

This requirement is met by a subgrant agreement with, or a letter of award requiring payment from the grant to, a subrecipient.</P>
                <P>(ii) Within 120 days after the date that the State obligates its funds to a unit of general purpose local government, the subrecipient must obligate all of those funds by a subgrant agreement with, or a letter of award requiring payment to, a private nonprofit organization; a procurement contract; or the written designation of a department within the government of the subrecipient to directly carry out an eligible activity.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Funds allocated to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and territories.</E> Within 180 days after the date that HUD signs the grant agreement (or a grant amendment for reallocation of funds) with the metropolitan city, urban county, or territory, the recipient must obligate all the grant amount, except the amount for its administrative costs. This requirement is met by an agreement with, or a letter of award requiring payment to, a subrecipient; a procurement contract; or a written designation of a department within the government of the recipient to directly carry out an eligible activity. If the recipient is an urban county, this requirement may also be met with an agreement with, or letter of award requiring payment to, a member government, which has designated a department to directly carry out an eligible activity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Expenditures.</E> The recipient must draw down and expend funds from each year's grant not less than once during each quarter of the recipient's program year. All of the recipient's grant must be expended for eligible activity costs <PRTPAGE P="199"/>within 24 months after the date HUD signs the grant agreement with the recipient. For the purposes of this paragraph, expenditure means either an actual cash disbursement for a direct charge for a good or service or an indirect cost or the accrual of a direct charge for a good or service or an indirect cost.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payments to subrecipients.</E> The recipient must pay each subrecipient for allowable costs within 30 days after receiving the subrecipient's complete payment request. This requirement also applies to each subrecipient that is a unit of general purpose local government.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Displacement, relocation, and acquisition.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Minimizing displacement.</E> Consistent with the other goals and objectives of Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), the recipient and its subrecipients must assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation not permitted.</E> No tenant-occupant of housing (a dwelling unit) that is converted into an emergency shelter may be required to relocate temporarily for a project assisted with ESG funds, or be required to move to another unit in the same building/complex. When a tenant moves for a project assisted with ESG funds under conditions that trigger the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA), 42 U.S.C. 4601-4655, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the tenant should be treated as permanently displaced and offered relocation assistance and payments consistent with that paragraph.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with, the URA and 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Whenever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable and suitable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require providing a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. (See 49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D).) As required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and 49 CFR part 24, replacement dwellings must also contain the accessibility features needed by displaced persons with disabilities.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Displaced Person.</E> (i) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm, including any corporation, partnership, or association) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under the ESG program. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
                <P>(A) After the owner (or person in control of the site) issues a notice to move permanently from the property or refuses to renew an expiring lease, if the move occurs on or after:</P>
                <P>(I) The date of the submission by the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) of an application for assistance to HUD (or the recipient, as applicable) that is later approved and funded if the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) has site control as evidenced by a deed, sales contract, or option contract to acquire the property; or</P>
                <P>(II) The date on which the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) selects the applicable site, if the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) does not have site control at the time of the application, provided that the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) eventually obtains control over the site;</P>
                <P>(B) Before the date described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if the recipient or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project; or</P>

                <P>(C) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit and the tenant moves after execution of the agreement covering <PRTPAGE P="209"/>the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition of the property for the project.</P>
                <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a displaced person if:</P>
                <P>(A) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement; violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause; and the recipient determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance.</P>

                <P>(B) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application but, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the person may be displaced), and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
                <P>(C) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(a)(9)(ii); or</P>
                <P>(D) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
                <P>(iii) The recipient or subrecipient may, at any time, request that HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this rule.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the type of replacement housing payment assistance to be provided to a displaced person pursuant to this section:</P>
                <P>(i) If the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement between the recipient and the subrecipient or the agreement between the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the property;</P>
                <P>(ii) If site control is only evidenced by an option contract to acquire the property, the “initiation of negotiations” does not become effective until the execution of a written agreement that creates a legally enforceable commitment to proceed with the purchase, such as a sales contract.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property, whether funded privately or publicly, for a project assisted with Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds is subject to the URA and Federal governmentwide regulations at 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the recipient's (or subrecipient's, if applicable) determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person may be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient under 49 CFR 24.10. A low-income person who disagrees with the recipient's determination may submit a written request for review of that determination by the appropriate HUD field office.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability of VAWA protections.</E> The core statutory protections of VAWA that prohibit denial or termination of assistance or eviction solely because an applicant or tenant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking applied upon enactment of VAWA 2013 on March 7, 2013. The VAWA regulatory requirements under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, as supplemented by this section, apply to all eligibility and termination decisions that are made with respect to ESG rental assistance on or after <E T="03">December 16, 2016.</E> The recipient must ensure that the requirements under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, are included or incorporated into rental assistance agreements and leases as provided in § 576.106(e) and (g).</P>

                <P>(3) The housing owner and the recipient or subrecipient that administers <PRTPAGE P="210"/>the rental assistance for the purposes of 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(2); and</P>
                <P>(4) The housing owner and the recipient or subrecipient that administers the rental assistance for the purposes of 24 CFR 5.2007. However, the recipient or subrecipient may limit documentation requests under 24 CFR 5.2007 to only the recipient or subrecipient, provided that:</P>
                <P>(i) This limitation is made clear in both the notice described under 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(1) and the rental assistance agreement;</P>
                <P>(ii) The entity designated to receive documentation requests determines whether the program participant is entitled to protection under VAWA and immediately advise the program participant of the determination; and</P>
                <P>(iii) If the program participant is entitled to protection, the entity designated to receive documentation requests must notify the owner in writing that the program participant is entitled to protection under VAWA and work with the owner on the program participant's behalf. Any further sharing or disclosure of the program participant's information will be subject to the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2007.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification.</E> As provided under 24 CFR 5.2005(a) each recipient or subrecipient that determines eligibility for or administers ESG rental assistance is responsible for ensuring that the notice and certification form described under 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(1) is provided to each applicant for ESG rental assistance and each program participant receiving ESG rental assistance at each of the following times:</P>

                <P>(3) When a program participant begins receiving ESG rental assistance;</P>
                <P>(4) When a program participant is notified of termination of ESG rental assistance; and</P>
                <P>(5) When a program participant receives notification of eviction.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Emergency transfer plan.</E> (1) The recipient must develop the emergency transfer plan under 24 CFR 5.2005(e) or, if the recipient is a state, require its subrecipients that administer ESG rental assistance to develop the emergency transfer plan(s) required under 24 CFR 5.2005(e). If the state's subrecipients are required to develop the plan(s), the recipient must specify whether an emergency transfer plan is to be developed for:</P>
                <P>(i) The state as a whole;</P>
                <P>(ii) Each area within the state that is covered by a Continuum of Care; or</P>

                <P>(ii) For families receiving tenant-based rental assistance, the required policies must specify what will happen with respect to the non-transferring family member(s), if the family separates in order to effect an emergency transfer.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Bifurcation.</E> For the purposes of this part, the following requirements shall apply in place of the requirements at 24 CFR 5.2009(b):</P>
                <P>(1) When a family receiving tenant-based rental assistance separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the family's tenant-based rental assistance and utility assistance, if any, shall continue for the family member(s) who are not evicted or removed.</P>

                <P>(2) If a family living in a unit receiving project-based rental assistance separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the family member(s) who are not evicted or removed can remain in the assisted unit without interruption to the rental <PRTPAGE P="211"/>assistance or utility assistance provided for the unit.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The recipient must have policies and procedures to ensure the requirements of this part are met, including those required by 2 CFR part 200. The policies and procedures must be established in writing and implemented by the recipient and its subrecipients to ensure that ESG funds are used in accordance with the requirements. In addition, sufficient records must be established and maintained to enable the recipient and HUD to determine whether ESG requirements are being met.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Homeless status.</E> The recipient must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure compliance with the homeless definition in § 576.2. The procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify homeless status. The procedures must establish the order of priority for obtaining evidence as third-party documentation first, intake worker observations second, and certification from the person seeking assistance third. However, lack of third-party documentation must not prevent an individual or family from being immediately admitted to emergency shelter, receiving street outreach services, or being immediately admitted to shelter or receiving services provided by a victim service provider. Records contained in an HMIS or comparable database used by victim service or legal service providers are acceptable evidence of third-party documentation and intake worker observations if the HMIS retains an auditable history of all entries, including the person who entered the data, the date of entry, and the change made; and if the HMIS prevents overrides or changes of the dates on which entries are made.</P>
                <P>(1) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, acceptable evidence includes a written observation by an outreach worker of the conditions where the individual or family was living, a written referral by another housing or service provider, or a certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) If the individual qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(iii) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, because he or she resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation and is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less, acceptable evidence includes the evidence described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and one of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Discharge paperwork or a written or oral referral from a social worker, case manager, or other appropriate official of the institution, stating the beginning and end dates of the time residing in the institution. All oral statements must be recorded by the intake worker; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Where the evidence in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not obtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain the evidence described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) and a certification by the individual seeking assistance that states he or she is exiting or has just exited an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less.</P>

                <P>(3) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (2) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, because the individual or family will imminently lose their housing, the evidence must include:<PRTPAGE P="212"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i)(A) A court order resulting from an eviction action that requires the individual or family to leave their residence within 14 days after the date of their application for homeless assistance; or the equivalent notice under applicable state law, a Notice to Quit, or a Notice to Terminate issued under state law;</P>

                <P>(C) An oral statement by the individual or head of household that the owner or renter of the housing in which they currently reside will not allow them to stay for more than 14 days after the date of application for homeless assistance. The intake worker must record the statement and certify that it was found credible. To be found credible, the oral statement must either: (I) be verified by the owner or renter of the housing in which the individual or family resides at the time of application for homeless assistance and documented by a written certification by the owner or renter or by the intake worker's recording of the owner or renter's oral statement; or (II) if the intake worker is unable to contact the owner or renter, be documented by a written certification by the intake worker of his or her due diligence in attempting to obtain the owner or renter's verification and the written certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that his or her statement was true and complete;</P>
                <P>(ii) Certification by the individual or head of household that no subsequent residence has been identified; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Certification or other written documentation that the individual or family lacks the resources and support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing.</P>
                <P>(4) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (3) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, because the individual or family does not otherwise qualify as homeless under the homeless definition but is an unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age, or homeless family with one or more children or youth, and is defined as homeless under another Federal statute or section 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)), the evidence must include:</P>

                <P>(i) For paragraph (3)(i) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, certification of homeless status by the local private nonprofit organization or state or local governmental entity responsible for administering assistance under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), subtitle N of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e <E T="03">et seq.</E>), section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786), or subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as applicable;</P>
                <P>(ii) For paragraph (3)(ii) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, referral by a housing or service provider, written observation by an outreach worker, or certification by the homeless individual or head of household seeking assistance;</P>

                <P>(iii) For paragraph (3)(iii) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, certification by the individual or head of household and any available supporting documentation that the individual or family moved two or more times during the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of application for homeless assistance, including: recorded statements or records obtained from each owner or renter of housing, provider of shelter or housing, or social worker, case worker, or other appropriate official of a hospital or institution in which the individual or family resided; or, where these statements or records are unobtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain these statements or records. Where a move was due to the individual or family fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, then <PRTPAGE P="213"/>the intake worker may alternatively obtain a written certification from the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they were fleeing that situation and that they resided at that address; and</P>
                <P>(iv) For paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, written diagnosis from a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition (or intake staff-recorded observation of disability that within 45 days of date of the application for assistance is confirmed by a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition); employment records; department of corrections records; literacy, English proficiency tests; or other reasonable documentation of the conditions required under paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition.</P>

                <P>(5) If the individual or family qualifies under paragraph (4) of the homeless definition in § 576.2, because the individual or family is fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions related to violence, then acceptable evidence includes an oral statement by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they are fleeing that situation, that no subsequent residence has been identified and that they lack the resources or support networks, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain other housing. If the individual or family is receiving shelter or services provided by a victim service provider, the oral statement must be documented by either a certification by the individual or head of household; or a certification by the intake worker. Otherwise, the oral statement that the individual or head of household seeking assistance has not identified a subsequent residence and lacks the resources or support networks, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain housing must be documented by a certification by the individual or head of household that the oral statement is true and complete, and, where the safety of the individual or family would not be jeopardized, the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening condition must be verified by a written observation by the intake worker or a written referral by a housing or service provider, social worker, legal assistance provider, health-care provider, law enforcement agency, legal assistance provider, pastoral counselor, or any other organization from whom the individual or head of household has sought assistance for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The written referral or observation need only include the minimum amount of information necessary to document that the individual or family is fleeing, or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">At risk of homelessness status.</E> For each individual or family who receives Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) homelessness prevention assistance, the records must include the evidence relied upon to establish and verify the individual or family's “at risk of homelessness” status. This evidence must include an intake and certification form that meets HUD specifications and is completed by the recipient or subrecipient. The evidence must also include:</P>
                <P>(1) If the program participant meets the criteria under paragraph (1) of the “at risk of homelessness” definition in § 576.2:</P>
                <P>(i) The documentation specified under this section for determining annual income;</P>

                <P>(ii) The program participant's certification on a form specified by HUD that the program participant has insufficient financial resources and support networks; <E T="03">e.g.,</E> family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, immediately available to attain housing stability and meets one or more of the conditions under paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition of “at risk of homelessness” in § 576.2;</P>

                <P>(iii) The most reliable evidence available to show that the program participant does not have sufficient resources or support networks; <E T="03">e.g.,</E> family, <PRTPAGE P="214"/>friends, faith-based or other social networks, immediately available to prevent them from moving to an emergency shelter or another place described in paragraph (1) of the “homeless” definition. Acceptable evidence includes:</P>

                <P>(2) HUD may change the method of payment to a reimbursement basis.</P>
                <P>(3) HUD may suspend payments to the extent HUD deems it necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for affected activities.</P>

                <P>(5) HUD may deny matching credit for all or part of the cost of the affected activities and require the recipient to make further matching contributions to make up for the contribution determined to be ineligible.</P>
                <P>(6) HUD may require the recipient to reimburse its line of credit in an amount equal to the funds used for the affected activities.</P>
                <P>(7) HUD may reduce or terminate the remaining grant of a recipient and reallocate those funds to other recipients in accordance with subpart D of this part.</P>
                <P>(8) HUD may condition a future grant.</P>
                <P>(9) HUD may take other remedies that are legally available.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Recipient sanctions.</E> If the recipient determines that a subrecipient is not complying with an ESG program requirement or its subgrant agreement, the recipient must take appropriate actions, as prescribed for HUD in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If the recipient is a State and funds become available as a result of an action under <PRTPAGE P="219"/>this section, the recipient must reallocate those funds to other subrecipients as soon as practicable. If the recipient is a unit of general purpose local government of territory, it must either reallocate those funds to other subrecipients or reprogram the funds for other activities to be carried out by the recipient as soon as practicable. The recipient must amend its Consolidated Plan in accordance with its citizenship participation plan if funds become available and are reallocated or reprogrammed under this section. The reallocated or reprogrammed funds must be used by the expenditure deadline in § 576.203.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Formula.</E> (1) After enactment of the annual appropriations act for each fiscal year, and issuance of the NOFA, HUD will publish, on its Web site, the Preliminary Pro Rata Need (PPRN) assigned to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and all other counties.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD will apply the formula used to determine PPRN established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to the amount of funds being made available under the NOFA. That amount is calculated by:</P>
                <P>(i) Determining the total amount for the Continuum of Care competition in accordance with section 413 of the Act or as otherwise directed by the annual appropriations act;</P>
                <P>(ii) From the amount in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, deducting the amount published in the NOFA as being set aside to provide a bonus to geographic areas for activities that have proven to be effective in reducing homelessness generally or for specific subpopulations listed in the NOFA or achieving homeless prevention and independent living goals established in the NOFA and to meet policy priorities set in the NOFA; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Deducting the amount of funding necessary for Continuum of Care planning activities and UFA costs.</P>
                <P>(3) PPRN is calculated on the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by using the following formula:</P>
                <P>(i) Two percent will be allocated among the four insular areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and the Virgin Islands) on the basis of the ratio of the population of each insular area to the population of all insular areas.</P>
                <P>(ii) Seventy-five percent of the remaining amount will be allocated, using the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) formula, to metropolitan cities and urban counties that have been funded under either the Emergency Shelter Grants or Emergency Solutions Grants programs in any one year since 2004.</P>
                <P>(iii) The amount remaining after the allocation under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section will be allocated, using the CDBG formula, to metropolitan cities and urban counties that have not been funded under the Emergency Solutions Grants program in any year since 2004 and all other counties in the United States and Puerto Rico.</P>
                <P>(4) If the calculation in paragraph (a)(2) of this section results in an amount less than the amount required to renew all projects eligible for renewal in that year for at least one year, after making adjustments proportional to increases in fair market rents for the geographic area for leasing, operating, and rental assistance for permanent housing, HUD will reduce, proportionately, the total amount required to renew all projects eligible for renewal in that year for at least one year, for each Continuum of Care. HUD will publish, via the NOFA, the total dollar amount that every Continuum will be required to deduct from renewal projects Continuum-wide.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculating a Continuum of Care's maximum award amount.</E> (1) <E T="03">Establish the PPRN amount.</E> First, HUD will total the PPRN amounts for each metropolitan city, urban county, other county, and insular area claimed by the Continuum as part of its geographic area, excluding any counties applying for or receiving funding from the Rural Housing <PRTPAGE P="228"/>Stability Assistance program under 24 CFR part 579.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Establishing renewal demand.</E> Next, HUD will determine the renewal demand within the Continuum's geographic area. Renewal demand is the sum of the annual renewal amounts of all projects within the Continuum eligible to apply for renewal in that fiscal year's competition, before any adjustments to rental assistance, leasing, and operating line items based on FMR changes.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Establishing FPRN.</E> The higher of PPRN or renewal demand for the Continuum of Care is the FPRN, which is the base for the maximum award amount for the Continuum.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Establishing the maximum award amount.</E> The maximum award amount for the Continuum is the FPRN amount plus any additional eligible amounts for Continuum planning; UFA costs; adjustments to leasing, operating and rental assistance line items based on changes to FMR; and available bonuses.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applications.</E> All applications to HUD, including applications for grant funds and requests for designation as a UFA or HPC, must be submitted at such time and in such manner as HUD may require, and contain such information as HUD determines necessary. At a minimum, an application for grant funds must contain a list of the projects for which it is applying for funds; a description of the projects; a list of the projects that will be carried out by subrecipients and the names of the subrecipients; a description of the subpopulations of homeless or at risk of homelessness to be served by projects; the number of units to be provided and/or the number of persons to be served by each project; a budget request by project; and reasonable assurances that the applicant, or the subrecipient, will own or have control of a site for the proposed project not later than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning upon notification of an award for grant assistance.</P>

Correcting all issues and conditions attached to an award must be completed within the time frame established in the NOFA. Proof of site control, match, environmental review, and the documentation of financial feasibility must be completed within 12 months of the announcement of the award, or 24 months in the case of funds for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction. The 12-month deadline may be extended by HUD for up to 12 additional months upon a showing of compelling reasons for delay due to factors beyond the control of the recipient or subrecipient.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">One applicant for a Continuum.</E> If a Continuum designates only one applicant for the geographic area, after awarding funds, HUD may enter into a grant agreement with that applicant for new awards, if any, and one grant agreement for renewals, Continuum of Care planning, and UFA costs, if any. These two grants will cover the entire <PRTPAGE P="229"/>geographic area. A default by the recipient under one of those grant agreements will also be a default under the other.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Unified Funding Agencies.</E> If a Continuum is a UFA that HUD has approved, then HUD will enter into one grant agreement with the UFA for new awards, if any, and one grant agreement for renewals, Continuum of Care planning and UFA costs, if any. These two grants will cover the entire geographic area. A default by the UFA under one of those grant agreements will also be a default under the other.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Required agreements.</E> Recipients will be required to sign a grant agreement in which the recipient agrees:</P>

                <P>(a) Activities under this part are subject to environmental review by HUD under 24 CFR part 50. The recipient or subrecipient shall supply all available, relevant information necessary for HUD to perform, for each property, any environmental review required by 24 CFR part 50. The recipient or subrecipient must carry out mitigating measures required by HUD or select an alternate eligible property. HUD may eliminate from consideration any application that would require an Environmental Impact Statement.</P>
                <P>(b) The recipient or subrecipient, its project partners, and their contractors may not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair, dispose of, demolish, or construct property for a project under this part, or commit or expend HUD or local funds for such eligible activities under this part, until HUD has performed an environmental review under 24 CFR part 50 and the recipient or subrecipient has received HUD approval of the property.</P>

To be considered for funding, recipients must submit a request in a form specified by HUD, must meet the requirements of this part, and must submit the request within the time frame established by HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Length of renewal.</E> HUD may award up to 3 years of funds for supportive services, leasing, HMIS, and operating costs. Renewals of tenant-based and sponsor-based rental assistance may be for up to one year of rental assistance. Renewals of project-based rental assistance may be for up to 15 years of rental assistance, subject to availability of annual appropriations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Assistance available.</E> (1) Assistance during each year of a renewal period may be for:</P>
                <P>(i) Up to 100 percent of the amount for supportive services and HMIS costs in the final year of the prior funding period;</P>
                <P>(ii) Up to 100 percent of the amount for leasing and operating in the final year of the prior funding period adjusted in proportion to changes in the FMR for the geographic area; and</P>
                <P>(iii) For rental assistance, up to 100 percent of the result of multiplying the number and unit size(s) in the grant agreement by the number of months in the renewal grant term and the applicable FMR.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Review criteria.</E> (1) Awards made under title IV of the Act, as in effect before August 30, 2012 are eligible for renewal in the Continuum of Care program even if the awardees would not be eligible for a new grant under the program, so long as they continue to serve the same population and the same number of persons or units in the same type of housing as identified in their most recently amended grant agreement signed before August 30, 2012. Grants will be renewed if HUD receives a certification from the Continuum that there is a demonstrated need for the project, and HUD finds that the project complied with program requirements applicable before August 30, 2012. For purposes of meeting the requirements of this part, a project will continue to be administered in accordance with 24 CFR 582.330, if the project received funding under the Shelter Plus Care program, or 24 CFR 583.325, if the project received funding under the Supportive Housing Program.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Renewal of awards made after August 30, 2012.</E> Review criteria for competitively awarded renewals made after August 30, 2012 will be described in the NOFA.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Unsuccessful projects.</E> HUD may renew a project that was eligible for renewal in the competition and was part of an application that was not funded <PRTPAGE P="232"/>despite having been submitted on time, in the manner required by HUD, and containing the information required by HUD, upon a finding that the project meets the purposes of the Continuum of Care program. The renewal will not exceed more than one year and will be under such conditions as HUD deems appropriate.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Annual Performance Report condition.</E> HUD may terminate the renewal of any grant and require the recipient to repay the renewal grant if:</P>
                <P>(1) The recipient fails to timely submit a HUD Annual Performance Report (APR) for the grant year immediately prior to renewal; or</P>
                <P>(2) The recipient submits an APR that HUD deems unacceptable or shows noncompliance with the requirements of the grant and this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Program components and uses of assistance.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Continuum of Care funds may be used to pay for the eligible costs listed in § 578.39 through § 578.63 when used to establish and operate projects under five program components: permanent housing; transitional housing; supportive services only; HMIS; and, in some cases, homelessness prevention. Although grant funds may be used by recipients and subrecipients in all components for the eligible costs of contributing data to the HMIS designated by the Continuum of Care, only HMIS Leads may use grant funds for an HMIS component. Administrative costs are eligible for all components. All components are subject to the restrictions on combining funds for certain eligible activities in a single project found in § 578.87(c). The eligible program components are:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Permanent housing (PH).</E> Permanent housing is community-based housing, the purpose of which is to provide housing without a designated length of stay. Grant funds may be used for acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, leasing, rental assistance, operating costs, and supportive services. PH includes:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Permanent supportive housing for persons with disabilities (PSH).</E> PSH can only provide assistance to individuals with disabilities and families in which one adult or child has a disability. Supportive services designed to meet the needs of the program participants must be made available to the program participants.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Rapid rehousing.</E> Continuum of Care funds may provide supportive services, as set forth in § 578.53, and/or short-term (up to 3 months) and/or medium-term (for 3 to 24 months) tenant-based rental assistance, as set forth in § 578.51(c), as necessary to help a homeless individual or family, with or without disabilities, move as quickly as possible into permanent housing and achieve stability in that housing. When providing short-term and/or medium-term rental assistance to program participants, the rental assistance is subject to § 578.51(a)(1), but not <PRTPAGE P="234"/>§ 578.51(a)(1)(i) and (ii); (a)(2); (c) and (f) through (i); and (l)(1). These projects:</P>
                <P>(A) Must follow the written policies and procedures established by the Continuum of Care for determining and prioritizing which eligible families and individuals will receive rapid rehousing assistance, as well as the amount or percentage of rent that each program participant must pay.</P>
                <P>(B) May set a maximum amount or percentage of rental assistance that a program participant may receive, a maximum number of months that a program participant may receive rental assistance, and/or a maximum number of times that a program participant may receive rental assistance. The recipient or subrecipient may also require program participants to share in the costs of rent. For the purposes of calculating rent for rapid rehousing, the rent shall equal the sum of the total monthly rent for the unit and, if the tenant pays separately for utilities, the monthly allowance for utilities (excluding telephone) established by the public housing authority for the area in which the housing is located.</P>
                <P>(C) Limit rental assistance to no more than 24 months to a household.</P>
                <P>(D) May provide supportive services for no longer than 6 months after rental assistance stops.</P>

                <P>(E) Must re-evaluate, not less than once annually, that the program participant lacks sufficient resources and support networks necessary to retain housing without Continuum of Care assistance and the types and amounts of assistance that the program participant needs to retain housing. The recipient or subrecipient may require each program participant receiving assistance to notify the recipient or subrecipient of changes in the program participant's income or other circumstances (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> changes in household composition) that affect the program participant's need for assistance. When notified of a relevant change, the recipient or subrecipient must reevaluate the program participant's eligibility and the amount and types of assistance that the program participant needs.</P>

                <P>(F) Require the program participant to meet with a case manager not less than once per month to assist the program participant in ensuring long-term housing stability. The project is exempt from this requirement if the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13925 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) prohibits the recipient carrying out the project from making its housing conditional on the participant's acceptance of services.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Transitional Housing (TH).</E> Transitional housing facilitates the movement of homeless individuals and families to PH within 24 months of entering TH. Grant funds may be used for acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, leasing, rental assistance, operating costs, and supportive services.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Supportive Service Only (SSO).</E> Funds may be used for acquisition, rehabilitation, relocation costs, or leasing of a facility from which supportive services will be provided, and supportive services in order to provide supportive services to unsheltered and sheltered homeless persons for whom the recipient or subrecipient is not providing housing or housing assistance.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Use.</E> (1) Where the recipient or subrecipient is leasing the structure, or portions thereof, grant funds may be used to pay for 100 percent of the costs of leasing a structure or structures, or portions thereof, to provide housing or supportive services to homeless persons for up to 3 years. Leasing funds may not be used to lease units or structures owned by the recipient, subrecipient, their parent organization(s), any other related organization(s), or organizations that are members of a partnership, where the partnership owns the structure, unless HUD authorized an exception for good cause.</P>

                <P>(2) Any request for an exception must include the following:<PRTPAGE P="237"/>
                </P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) <E T="03">Leasing structures.</E> When grants are used to pay rent for all or part of a structure or structures, the rent paid must be reasonable in relation to rents being charged in the area for comparable space. In addition, the rent paid may not exceed rents currently being charged by the same owner for comparable unassisted space.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Leasing individual units.</E> When grants are used to pay rent for individual housing units, the rent paid must be reasonable in relation to rents being charged for comparable units, taking into account the location, size, type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management services. In addition, the rents may not exceed rents currently being charged for comparable units, and the rent paid may not exceed HUD-determined fair market rents.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Utilities.</E> If electricity, gas, and water are included in the rent, these utilities may be paid from leasing funds. If utilities are not provided by the landlord, these utility costs are an operating cost, except for supportive service facilities. If the structure is being used as a supportive service facility, then these utility costs are a supportive service cost.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Security deposits and first and last month's rent.</E> Recipients and subrecipients may use grant funds to pay security deposits, in an amount not to exceed 2 months of actual rent.

                <P>(8) <E T="03">Transition.</E> Beginning in the first year awards are made under the Continuum of Care program, renewals of grants for leasing funds entered into under the authority of title IV, subtitle D of the Act as it existed before May 20, 2009, will be renewed either as grants for leasing or as rental assistance, depending on the characteristics of the project. Leasing funds will be renewed as rental assistance if the funds are used to pay rent on units where the lease is between the program participant and the landowner or sublessor. Projects requesting leasing funds will be renewed as leasing if the funds were used to lease a unit or structure and the lease is between the recipient or subrecipient and the landowner.</P>

Rental assistance cannot be provided to a program participant who is already receiving rental assistance, or living in a housing unit receiving rental assistance or operating assistance through other federal, State, or local sources.</P>
                <P>(i) The rental assistance may be short-term, up to 3 months of rent; medium-term, for 3 to 24 months of rent; or long-term, for longer than 24 months of rent and must be administered in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Continuum as set forth in § 578.7(a)(9) and this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) The rental assistance may be tenant-based, project-based, or sponsor-based, and may be for transitional or permanent housing.</P>

                <P>(2) Grant funds may be used for security deposits in an amount not to exceed 2 months of rent. An advance payment of the last month's rent may be provided to the landlord, in addition to the security deposit and payment of first month's rent.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Tenant-based rental assistance.</E> Tenant-based rental assistance is rental assistance in which program participants choose housing of an appropriate size in which to reside. Up to 5 years' worth of rental assistance may be awarded to a project in one competition.</P>
                <P>(1) When necessary to facilitate the coordination of supportive services, recipients and subrecipients may require program participants to live in a specific area for their entire period of participation, or in a specific structure for the first year and in a specific area for the remainder of their period of participation. Program participants who are receiving rental assistance in transitional housing may be required to live in a specific structure for their entire period of participation in transitional housing.</P>
                <P>(2) Program participants who have complied with all program requirements during their residence retain the rental assistance if they move.</P>
                <P>(3) Program participants who have complied with all program requirements during their residence, who have been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, who reasonably believe they are imminently threatened by harm from further domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking (which would include threats from a third party, such as a friend or family member of the perpetrator of the violence) if they remain in the assisted unit, and who are able to document the violence and basis for their belief, may retain the rental assistance and move to a different Continuum of Care geographic area if they move out of the assisted unit to protect their health and safety. These program participants may move to a different Continuum of Care's geographic service area even if the recipient or subrecipient cannot meet all regulatory requirements of this part in the new geographic area where the unit is located. The recipient or subrecipient, however, must be able to meet all statutory requirements of the Continuum of Care program either directly or through a third-party contract or agreement.</P>
                <P>(4) Program participants other than those described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section may choose housing outside of the Continuum of Care's geographic area if the recipient or subrecipient, through its employees or contractors, is able to meet all requirements of this part in the geographic area where the program participant chooses housing. If the recipient or subrecipient is unable to meet the requirements of this part, either directly or through a third-party contract or agreement, the recipient or subrecipient may refuse to permit the program participant to retain the tenant-based rental assistance if the program participant chooses to move outside of the Continuum of Care's geographic area.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Sponsor-based rental assistance.</E> Sponsor-based rental assistance is provided through contracts between the recipient and sponsor organization. A sponsor may be a private, nonprofit organization, or a community mental health agency established as a public nonprofit organization. Program participants must reside in housing owned or leased by the sponsor. Up to 5 years worth of rental assistance may be awarded to a project in one competition.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Project-based rental assistance.</E> Project-based rental assistance is provided through a contract with the owner of an existing structure, where the owner agrees to lease the subsidized units to program participants. Program participants will not retain rental assistance if they move. Up to 15 years of rental assistance may be awarded in one competition.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Grant amount.</E> The amount of rental assistance in each project will be based on the number and size of units proposed by the applicant to be assisted over the grant period. The amount of rental assistance in each project will be calculated by multiplying the number and size of units proposed by the FMR of each unit on the date the application is submitted to HUD, by the term of the grant.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Rent reasonableness.</E> HUD will only provide rental assistance for a unit if <PRTPAGE P="239"/>the rent is reasonable. The recipient or subrecipient must determine whether the rent charged for the unit receiving rental assistance is reasonable in relation to rents being charged for comparable unassisted units, taking into account the location, size, type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management and maintenance of each unit. Reasonable rent must not exceed rents currently being charged by the same owner for comparable unassisted units.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Payment of grant.</E> (1) The amount of rental assistance in each project will be reserved for rental assistance over the grant period. An applicant's request for rental assistance in each grant is an estimate of the amount needed for rental assistance. Recipients will make draws from the grant funds to pay the actual costs of rental assistance for program participants.</P>
                <P>(2) For tenant-based rental assistance, on demonstration of need:</P>
                <P>(i) Up to 25 percent of the total rental assistance awarded may be spent in any year of a 5-year grant term; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A higher percentage if approved in advance by HUD, if the recipient provides evidence satisfactory to HUD that it is financially committed to providing the housing assistance described in the application for the full 5-year period.</P>
                <P>(3) A recipient must serve at least as many program participants as shown in its application for assistance.</P>
                <P>(4) If the amount in each grant reserved for rental assistance over the grant period exceeds the amount that will be needed to pay the actual costs of rental assistance, due to such factors as contract rents being lower than FMRs and program participants being able to pay a portion of the rent, recipients or subrecipients may use the excess funds for covering the costs of rent increases, or for serving a greater number of program participants.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Vacancies.</E> If a unit assisted under this section is vacated before the expiration of the lease, the assistance for the unit may continue for a maximum of 30 days from the end of the month in which the unit was vacated, unless occupied by another eligible person. No additional assistance will be paid until the unit is occupied by another eligible person. Brief periods of stays in institutions, not to exceed 90 days for each occurrence, are not considered vacancies.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Property damage.</E> Recipients and subrecipients may use grant funds in an amount not to exceed one month's rent to pay for any damage to housing due to the action of a program participant. This shall be a one-time cost per participant, incurred at the time a participant exits a housing unit.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Resident rent.</E> Rent must be calculated as provided in § 578.77. Rents collected from program participants are program income and may be used as provided under § 578.97.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Leases.</E> (1) <E T="03">Initial lease.</E> For project-based, sponsor-based, or tenant-based rental assistance, program participants must enter into a lease agreement for a term of at least one year, which is terminable for cause. The leases must be automatically renewable upon expiration for terms that are a minimum of one month long, except on prior notice by either party.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Initial lease for transitional housing.</E> Program participants in transitional housing must enter into a lease agreement for a term of at least one month. The lease must be automatically renewable upon expiration, except on prior notice by either party, up to a maximum term of 24 months.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">VAWA emergency transfer plan costs.</E> Recipients and subrecipients of grants for tenant-based rental assistance may use grant funds to pay amounts owed for breaking the lease if the family qualifies for an emergency transfer under the emergency transfer plan established under § 578.99(j)(8).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The recipient or subrecipient must match all grant funds, except for leasing funds, with no less than 25 percent of funds or in-kind contributions from other sources. For Continuum of Care geographic areas in which there is more than one grant agreement, the 25 percent match must be provided on a grant-by-grant basis. Recipients that are UFAs or are the sole recipient for their Continuum, may provide match on a Continuum-wide basis. Cash match must be used for the costs of activities that are eligible under subpart D of this part, except that HPCs may use such match for the costs of activities that are eligible under § 578.71.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cash sources.</E> Notwithstanding 2 CFR 200.306(b)(5), a recipient or subrecipient may use funds from any source, including any other federal sources (excluding Continuum of Care program funds), as well as State, local, and private sources, provided that funds from the source are not statutorily prohibited to be used as a match. The recipient must ensure that any funds used to satisfy the matching requirements of this section are eligible under the laws governing the funds in order to be used as matching funds for a grant awarded under this program.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">In-kind contributions.</E> (1) The recipient or subrecipient may use the value of any real property, equipment, goods, or services contributed to the project as match, provided that if the recipient or subrecipient had to pay for them with grant funds, the costs would have been eligible under Subpart D, or, in the case of HPCs, eligible under § 578.71.</P>
                <P>(2) The requirements of 2 CFR 200.306, with the exception of § 200.306(b)(5) apply.</P>

                <P>(3) Before grant execution, services to be provided by a third party must be documented by a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the recipient or subrecipient and the third party that will provide the services. Services provided by individuals must be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the recipient's or subrecipient's organization. If the recipient or subrecipient does not have employees performing similar work, the rates must be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The MOU must establish the unconditional commitment, except for selection to receive a grant, by the third party to provide the services, the specific service to be provided, the profession of the persons providing the service, and the hourly cost of the service to be provided.</P>
                <P>(ii) During the term of the grant, the recipient or subrecipient must keep and make available, for inspection, records documenting the service hours provided.</P>

For housing rehabilitated with funds under this part, the lead-based paint requirements in 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, J, and R apply. For housing that receives project-based or sponsor-based rental assistance, 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R apply. For residential property for which funds under this part are used for acquisition, leasing, services, or operating costs, 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, K, and R apply.</P>
                <P>(1) Before any assistance will be provided on behalf of a program participant, the recipient, or subrecipient, must physically inspect each unit to assure that the unit meets HQS. Assistance will not be provided for units that fail to meet HQS, unless the owner corrects any deficiencies within 30 days from the date of the initial inspection and the recipient or subrecipient verifies that all deficiencies have been corrected.</P>
                <P>(2) Recipients or subrecipients must inspect all units at least annually during the grant period to ensure that the units continue to meet HQS.</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Ongoing assessment of supportive services.</E> To the extent practicable, each project must provide supportive services for residents of the project and homeless persons using the project, which may be designed by the recipient or participants. Each recipient and subrecipient of assistance under this part must conduct an ongoing assessment of the supportive services needed by the residents of the project, the availability of such services, and the coordination of services needed to ensure long-term housing stability and must make adjustments, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Residential supervision.</E> Each recipient and subrecipient of assistance under this part must provide residential supervision as necessary to facilitate the adequate provision of supportive services to the residents of the housing throughout the term of the commitment to operate supportive housing. Residential supervision may include the employment of a full- or part-time residential supervisor with <PRTPAGE P="248"/>sufficient knowledge to provide or to supervise the provision of supportive services to the residents.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Participation of homeless individuals.</E> (1) Each recipient and subrecipient must provide for the participation of not less than one homeless individual or formerly homeless individual on the board of directors or other equivalent policymaking entity of the recipient or subrecipient, to the extent that such entity considers and makes policies and decisions regarding any project, supportive services, or assistance provided under this part. This requirement is waived if a recipient or subrecipient is unable to meet such requirement and obtains HUD approval for a plan to otherwise consult with homeless or formerly homeless persons when considering and making policies and decisions.</P>
                <P>(2) Each recipient and subrecipient of assistance under this part must, to the maximum extent practicable, involve homeless individuals and families through employment; volunteer services; or otherwise in constructing, rehabilitating, maintaining, and operating the project, and in providing supportive services for the project.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Supportive service agreement.</E> Recipients and subrecipients may require the program participants to take part in supportive services that are not disability-related services provided through the project as a condition of continued participation in the program. Examples of disability-related services include, but are not limited to, mental health services, outpatient health services, and provision of medication, which are provided to a person with a disability to address a condition caused by the disability. Notwithstanding this provision, if the purpose of the project is to provide substance abuse treatment services, recipients and subrecipients may require program participants to take part in such services as a condition of continued participation in the program.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Retention of assistance after death, incarceration, or institutionalization for more than 90 days of qualifying member.</E> For permanent supportive housing projects surviving, members of any household who were living in a unit assisted under this part at the time of the qualifying member's death, long-term incarceration, or long-term institutionalization, have the right to rental assistance under this section until the expiration of the lease in effect at the time of the qualifying member's death, long-term incarceration, or long-term institutionalization.</P>

                <P>(4) <E T="03">Income.</E> Income must be calculated in accordance with 24 CFR 5.609 and 24 <PRTPAGE P="249"/>CFR 5.611(a). Recipients and subrecipients must examine a program participant's income initially, and if there is a change in family composition (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> birth of a child) or a decrease in the resident's income during the year, the resident may request an interim reexamination, and the occupancy charge will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Resident rent.</E> (1) <E T="03">Amount of rent.</E> (i) Each program participant on whose behalf rental assistance payments are made must pay a contribution toward rent in accordance with section 3(a)(1) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)(1)).</P>

Adjustments to a program participant's contribution toward the rental payment must be made as changes in income are identified.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Verification.</E> As a condition of participation in the program, each program participant must agree to supply the information or documentation necessary to verify the program participant's income.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> All recipients and subrecipients receiving grant funds for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction must operate the housing or provide supportive services in accordance with this part, for at least 15 years from the date of initial occupancy or date of initial service provision. Recipient and subrecipients must execute and record a HUD-approved Declaration of Restrictive Covenants before receiving payment of grant funds.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Conversion.</E> Recipients and subrecipients carrying out a project that provides transitional or permanent housing or supportive services in a structure may submit a request to HUD to convert a project for the direct benefit of very low-income persons. The request must be made while the project is operating as homeless housing or supportive services for homeless individuals and families, must be in writing, and must include an explanation of why the project is no longer needed to provide transitional or permanent housing or supportive services. The primary factor in HUD's decision on the proposed conversion is the unmet need for transitional or permanent housing or supportive services in the Continuum of Care's geographic area.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Repayment of grant funds.</E> If a project is not operated as transitional or permanent housing for 10 years following the date of initial occupancy, HUD will require repayment of the entire amount of the grant used for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction, unless conversion of the project has been authorized under paragraph (b) of this section. If the housing is used for such purposes for more than 10 years, the payment amount will be reduced by 20 percentage points for each year, beyond the 10-year period in which the project is used for transitional or permanent housing.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Prevention of undue benefits.</E> Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, upon any sale or other disposition of a project site that received grant funds for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction, occurring <PRTPAGE P="250"/>before the 15-year period, the recipient must comply with such terms and conditions as HUD may prescribe to prevent the recipient or subrecipient from unduly benefiting from such sale or disposition.</P>

                <P>(2) All the proceeds are used to provide transitional or permanent housing that meet the requirements of this part;</P>
                <P>(3) Project-based rental assistance or operating cost assistance from any federal program or an equivalent State or local program is no longer made available and the project is meeting applicable performance standards, provided that the portion of the project that had benefitted from such assistance continues to meet the tenant income and rent restrictions for low-income units under section 42(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or</P>
                <P>(4) There are no individuals and families in the Continuum of Care geographic area who are homeless, in which case the project may serve individuals and families at risk of homelessness.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Displacement, relocation, and acquisition.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Minimizing displacement.</E> Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, recipients and subrecipients must ensure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of projects assisted under this part. “Project,” as used in this section, means any activity or series of activities assisted with Continuum of Care funds received or anticipated in any phase of an undertaking.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> (1) <E T="03">Existing Building Not Assisted under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act.</E> No tenant may be required to relocate temporarily for a project if the building in which the project is being undertaken or will be undertaken is not currently assisted under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act. The absence of such assistance to the building means the tenants are not homeless and the tenants are therefore not eligible to receive assistance under the Continuum of Care program. When a tenant moves for such a project under conditions that cause the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA), 42 U.S.C. 4601-4655, to apply, the tenant must be treated as permanently displaced and offered relocation assistance and payments consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Existing Transitional Housing or Permanent Housing Projects Assisted Under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act.</E> Consistent with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, no program participant may be required to relocate temporarily for a project if the person cannot be offered a decent, safe, and sanitary unit in the same building or complex upon project completion under reasonable terms and conditions. The length of occupancy requirements in § 578.79 may prevent a program participant from returning to the property upon completion (See paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D) of this section). Any program participant who has been temporarily relocated for a period beyond one year must be treated as permanently displaced and offered relocation assistance and payments consistent with paragraph (c) of this section. Program participants temporarily relocated in accordance with the policies described in this paragraph must be provided:</P>
                <P>(i) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly rent/occupancy charges and utility costs; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
                <P>(A) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>

                <P>(B) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;<PRTPAGE P="251"/>
                </P>
                <P>(C) The reasonable terms and conditions under which the program participant will be able to occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building or complex upon completion of the project; and</P>
                <P>(D) The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance in accordance with the requirements of the URA and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act. Whenever possible, minority persons must be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require providing a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. See 49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Displaced person.</E> (i) For the purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for a project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
                <P>(A) After the owner (or person in control of the site) issues a notice to move permanently from the property, or refuses to renew an expiring lease, if the move occurs after the date of the submission by the recipient or subrecipient of an application for assistance to HUD (or the recipient, as applicable) that is later approved and funded and the recipient or subrecipient has site control as evidenced in accordance with § 578.25(b); or</P>
                <P>(B) After the owner (or person in control of the site) issues a notice to move permanently from the property, or refuses to renew an expiring lease, if the move occurs after the date the recipient or subrecipient obtains site control, as evidenced in accordance with § 578.25(b), if that occurs after the application for assistance; or</P>
                <P>(C) Before the date described under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, if the recipient or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project; or</P>
                <P>(D) By a tenant of a building that is not assisted under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act, if the tenant moves after execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition of the property for the project; or</P>
                <P>(ii) For the purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for a project that is made by a program participant occupying transitional housing or permanent housing assisted under Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Act, if any one of the following three situations occurs:</P>
                <P>(A) The program participant moves after execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition of the property for the project and is either not eligible to return upon project completion or the move occurs before the program participant is provided written notice offering the program participant an opportunity to occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building or complex upon project completion under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a lease (or occupancy agreement, as applicable) consistent with Continuum of Care program requirements, including a monthly rent or occupancy charge and monthly utility costs that does not exceed the maximum amounts established in § 578.77; or</P>

                <P>(B) The program participant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building or complex, <PRTPAGE P="252"/>and any one of the following situations occurs:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The program participant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The program participant is not eligible to return to the building or complex upon project completion; or</P>

                <P>(C) The program participant is required to move to another unit in the same building or complex, and any one of the following situations occurs:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The program participant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The program participant is not eligible to remain in the building or complex upon project completion; or</P>

                <P>(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” if:</P>
                <P>(A) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement; the eviction complied with applicable federal, State, or local requirements (see § 578.91); and the recipient or subrecipient determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>

                <P>(B) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application but, before signing a lease or occupancy agreement and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project's possible impact on the person (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or incur a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any relocation assistance provided under this section), as a result of the project;</P>
                <P>(C) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(a)(9)(ii));</P>
                <P>(D) The person is a program participant occupying transitional housing or permanent housing assisted under Title IV of the Act who must move as a direct result of the length-of- occupancy restriction under § 578.79; or</P>
                <P>(E) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
                <P>(iv) The recipient may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing replacement housing payment assistance to be provided to a displaced person pursuant to this section, if the displacement is a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement between the recipient and the subrecipient, or between the recipient (or subrecipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the property. In the case of an option contract to acquire property, the initiation of negotiations does not become effective until execution of a written agreement that creates a legally enforceable commitment to proceed with the purchase, such as a purchase agreement.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> Except for acquisitions described in 49 CFR 24.101(b)(1) through (5), the URA and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, subpart B apply to any acquisition of real property for a project where there are Continuum of Care funds in any part of the project costs.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the recipient's (or subrecipient's, if applicable) determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient (see 49 CFR 24.10). A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the recipient's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the local HUD field office.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Termination of assistance to program participants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Termination of assistance.</E> The recipient or subrecipient may terminate assistance to a program participant who violates program requirements or conditions of occupancy. Termination under this section does not bar the recipient or subrecipient from providing further assistance at a later date to the same individual or family.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Due process.</E> In terminating assistance to a program participant, the recipient or subrecipient must provide a <PRTPAGE P="254"/>formal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance under the due process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:</P>
                <P>(1) Providing the program participant with a written copy of the program rules and the termination process before the participant begins to receive assistance;</P>
                <P>(2) Written notice to the program participant containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Hard-to-house populations.</E> Recipients and subrecipients that are providing permanent supportive housing for hard-to-house populations of homeless persons must exercise judgment and examine all extenuating circumstances in determining when violations are serious enough to warrant termination so that a program participant's assistance is terminated only in the most severe cases.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements.</E> The nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements set forth in 24 CFR 5.105(a) are applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Housing for specific subpopulations.</E> Recipients and subrecipients may exclusively serve a particular homeless subpopulation in transitional or permanent housing if the housing addresses a need identified by the Continuum of Care for the geographic area and meets one of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The housing may be limited to one sex where such housing consists of a single structure with shared bedrooms or bathing facilities such that the considerations of personal privacy and the physical limitations of the configuration of the housing make it appropriate for the housing to be limited to one sex;</P>

                <P>(2) The housing may be limited to a specific subpopulation, so long as admission does not discriminate against any protected class under federal nondiscrimination laws in 24 CFR 5.105 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the housing may be limited to homeless veterans, victims of domestic violence and their children, or chronically homeless persons and families).</P>
                <P>(3) The housing may be limited to families with children.</P>
                <P>(4) If the housing has in residence at least one family with a child under the age of 18, the housing may exclude registered sex offenders and persons with a criminal record that includes a violent crime from the project so long as the child resides in the housing.</P>
                <P>(5) Sober housing may exclude persons who refuse to sign an occupancy agreement or lease that prohibits program participants from possessing, using, or being under the influence of illegal substances and/or alcohol on the premises.</P>

                <P>(6) If the housing is assisted with funds under a federal program that is limited by federal statute or Executive Order to a specific subpopulation, the housing may be limited to that subpopulation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> housing also assisted with funding from the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program under 24 CFR part 574 may be limited to persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or related diseases).</P>

                <P>(7) Recipients may limit admission to or provide a preference for the housing to subpopulations of homeless persons and families who need the specialized supportive services that are provided in the housing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> substance abuse addiction treatment, domestic violence services, or a high intensity package designed to meet the needs of hard-to-reach homeless persons). While the housing may offer services for a particular type of disability, no otherwise eligible individuals with disabilities or families including an individual with a disability, who may benefit from the services provided may be excluded on the grounds that they do not have a particular disability.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Affirmatively furthering fair housing.</E> A recipient must implement its <PRTPAGE P="255"/>programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, which means that the recipient must:</P>
                <P>(1) Affirmatively market their housing and supportive services to eligible persons regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, familial status, or handicap who are least likely to apply in the absence of special outreach, and maintain records of those marketing activities;</P>
                <P>(2) Where a recipient encounters a condition or action that impedes fair housing choice for current or prospective program participants, provide such information to the jurisdiction that provided the certification of consistency with the Consolidated Plan; and</P>
                <P>(3) Provide program participants with information on rights and remedies available under applicable federal, State and local fair housing and civil rights laws.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Accessibility and integrative housing and services for persons with disabilities.</E> Recipients and subrecipients must comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act (24 CFR part 100), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (24 CFR part 8), and Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as applicable (28 CFR parts 35 and 36). In accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.4(d), recipients must ensure that their program's housing and supportive services are provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of persons with disabilities.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Prohibition against involuntary family separation.</E> The age and gender of a child under age 18 must not be used as a basis for denying any family's admission to a project that receives funds under this part.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuum of Care board members.</E> No Continuum of Care board member may participate in or influence discussions or resulting decisions concerning the award of a grant or other financial benefits to the organization that the member represents.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Organizational conflict.</E> An organizational conflict of interest arises when, because of activities or relationships with other persons or organizations, the recipient or subrecipient is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance in the provision of any type or amount of assistance under this part, or when a covered person's, as in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, objectivity in performing work with respect to any activity assisted under this part is or might be otherwise impaired. Such an organizational conflict would arise when a board member of an applicant participates in decision of the applicant concerning the award of a grant, or provision of other financial benefits, to the organization that such member represents. It would also arise when an employee of a recipient or subrecipient participates in making rent reasonableness determinations under § 578.49(b)(2) and § 578.51(g) and housing quality inspections of property under § 578.75(b) that the recipient, subrecipient, or related entity owns.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Other conflicts.</E> For all other transactions and activities, the following restrictions apply:</P>
                <P>(1) No covered person, meaning a person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the recipient or its subrecipients and who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted under this part, or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to activities assisted under this part, may obtain a financial interest or benefit from an assisted activity, have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect to an assisted activity, or have a financial interest in the proceeds derived from an assisted activity, either for him or herself or for those with whom he or she has immediate family or business ties, during his or her tenure or during the one-year period following his or her tenure.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of this section on a case-by-case basis, taking <PRTPAGE P="256"/>into account the cumulative effects of the criteria in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that the recipient has satisfactorily met the threshold requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Threshold requirements.</E> HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following documentation:</P>
                <P>(A) Disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by a written assurance, if the recipient is a government, that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and if the recipient is a private nonprofit organization, that the conflict has been disclosed in accordance with their written code of conduct or other conflict-of-interest policy; and</P>
                <P>(B) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law, or if the subrecipient is a private nonprofit organization, the exception would not violate the organization's internal policies.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Factors to be considered for exceptions.</E> In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the threshold requirements under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, HUD must conclude that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the Continuum of Care program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's or subrecipient's project, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(A) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project that would otherwise not be available;</P>
                <P>(B) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;</P>
                <P>(C) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions, responsibilities, or the decision-making process with respect to the specific activity in question;</P>
                <P>(D) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in the position described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</P>
                <P>(E) Whether undue hardship will result to the recipient, the subrecipient, or the person affected, when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict;</P>
                <P>(F) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class; and</P>
                <P>(G) Any other relevant considerations.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of Continuum of Care technical assistance is to increase the effectiveness with which Continuums of Care, eligible applicants, recipients, subrecipients, and UFAs implement and administer their Continuum of Care planning process; improve their capacity to prepare applications; prevent the separation of families in projects funded under the Emergency Solutions Grants, Continuum of Care, and Rural Housing Stability Assistance programs; and adopt and provide best practices in housing and services for persons experiencing homelessness.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Defined.</E> Technical assistance means the transfer of skills and knowledge to entities that may need, but do not possess, such skills and knowledge. The assistance may include, but is not limited to, written information such as papers, manuals, guides, and brochures; person-to-person exchanges; web-based curriculums, training and Webinars, and their costs.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Set-aside.</E> HUD may set aside funds annually to provide technical assistance, either directly by HUD staff or indirectly through third-party providers.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Awards.</E> From time to time, as HUD determines the need, HUD may advertise and competitively select providers to deliver technical assistance. HUD may enter into contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, when necessary, to implement the technical assistance. HUD may also enter into agreements with other federal agencies for awarding the technical assistance funds.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The recipient and its subrecipients must establish and maintain standard operating procedures for ensuring that Continuum of Care program funds are used in accordance with the requirements of this part and must establish and maintain sufficient records to enable HUD to determine whether the recipient and its subrecipients are meeting the requirements of this part, including:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Continuum of Care records.</E> Each collaborative applicant must keep the following documentation related to establishing and operating a Continuum of Care:</P>

                <P>(4) <E T="03">Chronically homeless status.</E> The recipient must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure compliance with the chronically homeless definition in § 578.3. The procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify chronically homeless status. The procedures must establish the order of priority for obtaining evidence as third-party documentation first, intake worker observations second, and certification from the person seeking assistance third. Records contained in <PRTPAGE P="261"/>an HMIS, or comparable database used by victim service or legal service providers, are acceptable evidence of third-party documentation and intake worker observations if the HMIS, or comparable database, retains an auditable history of all entries, including the person who entered the data, the date of entry, and the change made, and if the HMIS prevents overrides or changes of the dates on which entries are made.</P>
                <P>(i) For paragraph (1) of the “Chronically homeless” definition in § 578.3, evidence that the individual is a “homeless individual with a disability” as defined in section 401(9) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11360(9)) must include:</P>

                <P>(B) A written observation by an outreach worker of the conditions where the individual was living;</P>
                <P>(C) A written referral by another housing or service provider; or</P>
                <P>(D) Where evidence in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section cannot be obtained, a certification by the individual seeking assistance, which must be accompanied by the intake worker's documentation of the living situation of the individual or family seeking assistance and the steps taken to obtain evidence in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (C).</P>
                <P>(iii) For paragraph (1)(ii) of the “Chronically homeless” definition in § 578.3, evidence must include a combination of the evidence described in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(A) Third-party documentation of a single encounter with a homeless service provider on a single day within 1 month is sufficient to consider an individual as homeless and living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or an emergency shelter for the entire calendar month (e.g., an encounter on May 5, 2015, counts for May 1—May 31, 2015), unless there is evidence that there have been at least 7 consecutive nights not living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or an emergency shelter during that month (e.g., evidence in HMIS of a stay in transitional housing);</P>
                <P>(B) Each break in homelessness of at least 7 consecutive nights not living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter between separate occasions must be documented with the evidence described in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section;</P>

                <P>(C) Evidence of stays in institutional care facilities fewer than 90 days included in the total of at least 12 months of living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or an emergency shelter must include the evidence in paragraphs <PRTPAGE P="262"/>(a)(4)(iv)(A) through (B) of this section and evidence described in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section that the individual was living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or an emergency shelter immediately prior to entering the institutional care facility; and</P>
                <P>(D) For at least 75 percent of the chronically homeless individuals and families assisted by a recipient in a project during an operating year, no more than 3 months of living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or an emergency shelter may be documented using the evidence in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) of this section for each assisted chronically homeless individual or family. This limitation does not apply to documentation of breaks in homelessness between separate occasions, which may be documented entirely based on a self-report by the individual seeking assistance.</P>
                <P>(iv) If an individual qualifies as chronically homeless under paragraph (2) of the “Chronically homeless” definition in § 578.3 because he or she has been residing in an institutional care facility for fewer than 90 days and met all of the criteria in paragraph (1) of the definition, before entering that facility, evidence must include the following:</P>

                <P>(v) If a family qualifies as chronically homeless under paragraph (3) of the “Chronically homeless” definition in § 578.3, evidence must include the evidence as set forth in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section that the adult head of household (or if there is no adult in the family, a minor head of household) met all of the criteria in paragraph (1) or (2) of the definition.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">At risk of homelessness status.</E> For those recipients and subrecipients that serve persons at risk of homelessness, the recipient or subrecipient must keep records that establish “at risk of homelessness” status of each individual or family who receives Continuum of Care homelessness prevention assistance. Acceptable evidence is found in 24 CFR 576.500(c).</P>

In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the records and reports from the recipient and subrecipients, as well as information from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and information generated from HUD's financial and reporting systems (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> LOCCS and e-snaps) and HMIS. Where applicable, HUD may also consider relevant information pertaining to the recipient's performance gained from other sources, including citizen comments, complaint determinations, and litigation.<PRTPAGE P="266"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) If HUD determines preliminarily that the recipient or one of its subrecipients has not complied with a program requirement, HUD will give the recipient notice of this determination and an opportunity to demonstrate, within the time prescribed by HUD and on the basis of substantial facts and data that the recipient has complied with the requirements. HUD may change the method of payment to require the recipient to submit documentation before payment and obtain HUD's prior approval each time the recipient draws down funds. To obtain prior approval, the recipient may be required to manually submit its payment requests and supporting documentation to HUD in order to show that the funds to be drawn down will be expended on eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements.</P>
                <P>(3) If the recipient fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that the activities were carried out in compliance with program requirements, HUD may take one or more of the remedial actions or sanctions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Remedial actions and sanctions.</E> Remedial actions and sanctions for a failure to meet a program requirement will be designed to prevent a continuation of the deficiency; to mitigate, to the extent possible, its adverse effects or consequences; and to prevent its recurrence.</P>

                <P>(ii) Establishing and following a management plan that assigns responsibilities for carrying out the remedial actions;</P>
                <P>(iii) Canceling or revising activities or projects likely to be affected by the noncompliance, before expending grant funds for them;</P>

                <P>(vi) Reducing or terminating the remaining grant of a subrecipient and either reallocating those funds to other subrecipients or returning funds to HUD; and</P>
                <P>(vii) Making matching contributions before or as draws are made from the recipient's grant.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD may change the method of payment to a reimbursement basis.</P>
                <P>(3) HUD may suspend payments to the extent HUD determines necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for affected activities or projects.</P>
                <P>(4) HUD may continue the grant with a substitute recipient of HUD's choosing.</P>
                <P>(5) HUD may deny matching credit for all or part of the cost of the affected activities and require the recipient to make further matching contributions to make up for the contribution determined to be ineligible.</P>
                <P>(6) HUD may require the recipient to reimburse the recipient's line of credit in an amount equal to the funds used for the affected activities.</P>
                <P>(7) HUD may reduce or terminate the remaining grant of a recipient.</P>
                <P>(8) HUD may condition a future grant.</P>
                <P>(9) HUD may take other remedies that are legally available.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Recipient sanctions.</E> If the recipient determines that a subrecipient is not complying with a program requirement or its subrecipient agreement, the recipient must take one of the actions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Deobligation.</E> HUD may deobligate funds for the following reasons:</P>
                <P>(1) If the timeliness standards in § 578.85 are not met;</P>

                <P>(2) If HUD determines that delays completing construction activities for a project will mean that the funds for other funded activities cannot reasonably be expected to be expended for eligible costs during the remaining term of the grant;<PRTPAGE P="267"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) If the actual total cost of acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction for a project is less than the total cost agreed to in the grant agreement;</P>
                <P>(4) If the actual annual leasing costs, operating costs, supportive services costs, rental assistance costs, or HMIS costs are less than the total cost agreed to in the grant agreement for a one-year period;</P>
                <P>(5) Program participants have not moved into units within 3 months of the time that the units are available for occupancy; and</P>

Each canvass will collect information on properties not previously reported and about property reported previously the status or classification of which has changed or for which any of the information reported on the property checklist has changed.</P>
              <P>(1) HUD will request descriptive information on properties sufficient to make a reasonable determination, under the criteria described below, of the suitability of a property for use as a facility to assist the homeless.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD will direct landholding agencies to respond to requests for information within 25 days of receipt of such requests.</P>

Properties that are under lease, contract, license, or agreement by which a Federal agency retains a real property interest or which are scheduled to become unutilized or underutilized will be reviewed for suitability no earlier than six months prior to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or underutilized, except that properties subject to the Base Closure and Realignment Act may be reviewed up to eighteen months prior to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or underutilized.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Written record of suitability determination.</E> HUD will assign an identification number to each property reviewed for suitability. HUD will maintain a written public record of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The suitability determination for a particular piece of property, and the reasons for that determination; and</P>
              <P>(2) The landholding agency's response to the determination pursuant to the requirements of § 581.7(a).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Property determined unsuitable.</E> Property that is reviewed by HUD under this section and that is determined unsuitable for use to assist the homeless may not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of a Notice of unsuitability to allow for review of the determination at the request of a representative of the homeless.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedures for appealing unsuitability determinations.</E> (1) To request review of a determination of unsuitability, a representative of the homeless must contact HUD within 20 days of publication of notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that a property is unsuitable. Requests may be submitted to HUD in writing or by calling 1-800-927-7588 (Toll Free). Written requests must be received no later than 20 days after notice of unsuitability is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Requests for review of a determination of unsuitability may be made only by representatives of the homeless, as defined in § 581.1.</P>
              <P>(3) The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is based, i.e., that HUD has improperly applied the criteria or that HUD has relied on incorrect or incomplete information in making the determination (e.g., that property is in a floodplain but not in a floodway).</P>

              <P>(4) Upon receipt of a request to review a determination of unsuitability, HUD will notify the landholding agency that such a request has been made, request that the agency respond with any information pertinent to the review, and advise the agency that it should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed <PRTPAGE P="271"/>its reconsideration regarding unsuitability.</P>
              <P>(i) HUD will act on all requests for review within 30 days of receipt of the landholding agency's response and will notify the representative of the homeless and the landholding agency in writing of its decision.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a property is determined suitable as a result of the review, HUD will request the landholding agency's determination of availability pursuant to § 581.7(a), upon receipt of which HUD will promptly publish the determination in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> If the determination of unsuitability stands, HUD will inform the representative of the homeless of its decision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Real property reported excess to GSA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each landholding agency must submit a report to GSA of properties it determines excess. Each landholding agency must also provide a copy of HUD's suitability determination, if any, including HUD's identification number for the property.</P>
              <P>(b) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability and HUD determined the property suitable, GSA will screen the property pursuant to § 581.5(g) and will advise HUD of the availability of the property for use by the homeless as provided in § 581.5(e). In lieu of the above, GSA may submit a new checklist to HUD and follow the procedures in § 581.5(c) through § 581.5(g).</P>
              <P>(c) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA which has not been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability, GSA will complete a property checklist, based on information provided by the landholding agency, and will forward this checklist to HUD for a suitability determination. This checklist will reflect any change in classification, i.e., from unutilized or underutilized to excess.</P>
              <P>(d) Within 30 days after GSA's submission, HUD will advise GSA of the suitability determination.</P>
              <P>(e) When GSA receives a letter from HUD listing suitable excess properties in GSA's inventory, GSA will transmit to HUD within 45 days a response which includes the following for each identified property:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement that there is no other compelling Federal need for the property, and therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or</P>
              <P>(2) A statement that there is further and compelling Federal need for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the homeless.</P>

              <P>(f) When an excess property is determined suitable and available and notice is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> GSA will concurrently notify HHS, HUD, State and local government units, known homeless assistance providers that have expressed interest in the particular property, and other organizations, as appropriate, concerning suitable properties.</P>
              <P>(g) Upon submission of a Report of Excess to GSA, GSA may screen the property for Federal use. In addition, GSA may screen State and local governmental units and eligible nonprofit organizations to determine interest in the property in accordance with current regulations. (See 41 CFR 101-47.203-5, 101-47.204-1 and 101-47.303-2.)</P>
              <P>(h) The landholding agency will retain custody and accountability and will protect and maintain any property which is reported excess to GSA as provided in 41 CFR 101-47.402.</P>

              <P>(a) All properties, buildings and land will be determined suitable unless a property's characteristics include one or more of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">National security concerns.</E> A property located in an area to which the general public is denied access in the interest of national security (e.g., where a special pass or security clearance is a condition of entry to the property) will be determined unsuitable. Where alternative access can be provided for the public without compromising national security, the property will not be determined unsuitable on this basis.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Property containing flammable or explosive materials.</E> A property located within 2000 feet of an industrial, commercial or Federal facility handling <PRTPAGE P="272"/>flammable or explosive material (excluding underground storage) will be determined unsuitable. Above ground containers with a capacity of 100 gallons or less, or larger containers which provide the heating or power source for the property, and which meet local safety, operation, and permitting standards, will not affect whether a particular property is determined suitable or unsuitable. Underground storage, gasoline stations and tank trucks are not included in this category and their presence will not be the basis of an unsuitability determination unless there is evidence of a threat to personal safety as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Floodway.</E> A property located in the floodway of a 100 year floodplain will be determined unsuitable. If the floodway has been contained or corrected, or if only an incidental portion of the property not affecting the use of the remainder of the property is in the floodway, the property will not be determined unsuitable.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Documented deficiencies.</E> A property with a documented and extensive condition(s) that represents a clear threat to personal physical safety will be determined unsuitable. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, contamination, structural damage or extensive deterioration, friable asbestos, PCB's, or natural hazardous substances such as radon, periodic flooding, sinkholes or earth slides.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Inaccessible.</E> A property that is inaccessible will be determined unsuitable. An inaccessible property is one that is not accessible by road (including property on small off-shore islands) or is land locked (e.g., can be reached only by crossing private property and there is no established right or means of entry).</P>

Any applicant applying for a deed of a particular property, pursuant to § 581.9(b)(3), must comply with local zoning requirements, as specified in 45 CFR part 12.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope of evaluations.</E> Due to the short time frame imposed for evaluating applications, HHS' evaluation will, generally, be limited to the information contained in the application.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Deadline.</E> Completed applications must be received by DHFP, at the above address, within 90 days after an expression of interest is received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written request from the applicant, HHS may grant extensions, provided that the appropriate landholding agency concurs with the extension. Because each applicant will have a different deadline based on the date the applicant submitted an expression of interest, applicants should contact the individual landholding agency to confirm that a particular property remains available prior to submitting an application.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Evaluations.</E> (1) Upon receipt of an application, HHS will review it for completeness, and, if incomplete, may return it or ask the applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information prior to final evaluation of the application.</P>

              <P>(2) HHS will evaluate each completed application within 25 days of receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis. HHS will notify all organizations which have submitted expressions of interest for a particular property regarding whether the first application received for that property has been approved or disapproved. All applications will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements, which are listed in <PRTPAGE P="275"/>descending order of priority, except that paragraphs (e)(2)(iv) and (e)(2)(v) of this section are of equal importance.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Services offered.</E> The extent and range of proposed services, such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Need.</E> The demand for the program and the degree to which the available property will be fully utilized.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Implementation time.</E> The amount of time necessary for the proposed program to become operational.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Experience.</E> Demonstrated prior success in operating similar programs and recommendations attesting to that fact by Federal, State, and local authorities.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Financial ability.</E> The adequacy of funding that will likely be available to run the program fully and properly and to operate the facility.</P>
              <P>(3) Additional evaluation factors may be added as deemed necessary by HHS. If additional factors are added, the application packet will be revised to include a description of these additional factors.</P>
              <P>(4) If HHS receives one or more competing applications for a property within 5 days of the first application HHS will evaluate all completed applications simultaneously. HHS will rank approved applications based on the elements listed in § 581.8(e)(2), and notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, of the relative ranks.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Action on approved applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Unutilized and underutilized properties.</E> (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and forward a copy of the application to the landholding agency. The landholding agency will execute the lease, or permit document, as appropriate, in consultation with the applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The length of time the property will be available. (Leases and permits will be for a period of at least one year unless the applicant requests a shorter term.)</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether to grant use of the property via a lease or permit;</P>
              <P>(iii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Excess and surplus properties.</E> (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign the property to HHS for leasing. Upon receipt of the assignment, HHS will execute a lease in accordance with the procedures and requirements set out in 45 CFR part 12. In accordance with 41 CFR 101-47.402, custody and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term with the agency which initially reported the property as excess.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses and other important national needs; however, in deciding the disposition of surplus real property, GSA will generally give priority of consideration to uses to assist the homeless. GSA may consider any competing request for the property made under section 203(k) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)) that is so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the homeless, and HHS may likewise consider any competing request made under subsection 203(k)(1) of that law.</P>
              <P>(3) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over a request for property for homeless assistance use as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency making the decision will transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory statement which details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Deeds.</E> Surplus property may be conveyed to representatives of the homeless pursuant to section 203(k) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(1), and section 501(f) of the McKinney Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 11411. Representatives of the homeless must complete the application packet pursuant to the requirements of § 581.9 of this part and in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR part 12.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Completion of lease term and reversion of title.</E> Lessees and grantees will be responsible for the protection and <PRTPAGE P="276"/>maintenance of the property during the time that they possess the property. Upon termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the Federal government, the lessee or grantee will be responsible for removing any improvements made to the property and will be responsible for restoration of the property. If such improvements are not removed, they will become the property of the Federal government. GSA or the landholding agency, as appropriate, will assume responsibility for protection and maintenance of a property when the lease terminates or title reverts.</P>

              <P>The landholding agency will defer, for 20 days after the date that notice of a property is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> action to dispose of properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance. HUD will inform landholding agencies or GSA if appeal of an unsuitability determination is filed by a representative of the homeless pursuant to § 581.4(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable law.</P>

Where there is no expression of interest, GSA or the landholding agency, as appropriate, will proceed with disposal in accordance with applicable law.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon advice from HHS that all applications have been disapproved, or if no completed applications or requests for extensions have been received by HHS within 90 days from the date of the last expression of interest, disposal may proceed in accordance with applicable law.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Shelter Plus Care program (S+C) is authorized by title IV, subtitle F, of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (the McKinney Act) (42 U.S.C. 11403-11407b). S+C is designed to link rental assistance to supportive services for hard-to-serve homeless persons with disabilities (primarily those who are seriously mentally ill; have chronic problems with alcohol, drugs, or both; or have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related diseases) and their families. The program provides grants to be used for rental assistance for permanent housing for homeless persons with disabilities. Rental assistance grants must be matched in the aggregate by supportive services that are equal in value to the amount of rental assistance and appropriate to the needs of the population to be served. Recipients are chosen on a competitive basis nationwide.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Components.</E> Rental assistance is provided through four components described in § 582.100. Applicants may apply for assistance under any one of the four components, or a combination.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Tenant-based rental assistance (TRA).</E> Tenant-based rental assistance <PRTPAGE P="280"/>provides grants for rental assistance which permit participants to choose housing of an appropriate size in which to reside. Participants retain the rental assistance if they move. Where necessary to facilitate the coordination of supportive services, grant recipients may require participants to live in a specific area for their entire period of participation or in a specific structure for the first year and in a specific area for the remainder of their period of participation. Recipients may not define the area in a way that violates the Fair Housing Act or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The term of the grant between HUD and the grant recipient for TRA is five years.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Project-based rental assistance (PRA).</E> Project-based rental assistance provides grants for rental assistance to the owner of an existing structure, where the owner agrees to lease the subsidized units to participants. Participants do not retain rental assistance if they move. Rental subsidies are provided to the owner for a period of either five or ten years. To qualify for ten years of rental subsidies, the owner must complete at least $3,000 of eligible rehabilitation for each unit (including the unit's prorated share of work to be accomplished on common areas or systems), to make the structure decent, safe and sanitary. This rehabilitation must be completed with in 12 months of the grant award.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Sponsor-based rental assistance (SRA).</E> Sponsor-based rental assistance provides grants for rental assistance through contracts between the grant recipient and sponsor organizations. A sponsor may be a private, nonprofit organization or a community mental health agency established as a public nonprofit organization. Participants reside in housing owned or leased by the sponsor. The term of the grant between HUD and the grant recipient for SRA is five years.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy dwellings (SRO).</E> (1) The SRO component provides grants for rental assistance in connection with the moderate rehabilitation of single room occupancy housing units. Resources to initially fund the cost of rehabilitating the dwellings must be obtained from other sources. However, the rental assistance covers operating expenses of the rehabilitated SRO units occupied by homeless persons, including debt service to retire the cost of the moderate rehabilitation over a ten-year period.</P>
                <P>(2) SRO housing must be in need of moderate rehabilitation and must meet the requirements of 24 CFR 882.803(a). Costs associated with rehabilitation of common areas may be included in the calculation of the cost for assisted units based on the proportion of the number of units to be assisted under this part to the total number of units.</P>
                <P>(3) SRO assistance may also be used for efficiency units selected for rehabilitation under this program, but the gross rent (contract rent plus any utility allowance) for those units will be no higher than for SRO units (i.e., 75 percent of the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent).</P>
                <P>(4) The requirements regarding maintenance, operation, and inspections described in 24 CFR 882.806(b)(4) and 882.808(n) must be met.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Governing regulations.</E> Except where there is a conflict with any requirement under this part or where specifically provided, the SRO component will be governed by the regulations set forth in 24 CFR part 882, subpart H.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Rental assistance amounts and payments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible activity.</E> S+C grants may be used for providing rental assistance for housing occupied by participants in the program and administrative costs as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, except that the housing may not be currently receiving Federal funding for rental assistance or operating costs under other HUD programs. Recipients may design a housing program that includes a range of housing types with differing levels of supportive services. Rental assistance may include security deposits on units in an amount up to one month's rent.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of the grant.</E> The amount of the grant is based on the number and size of units proposed by the applicant to be assisted over the grant period. The grant amount is calculated by multiplying the number of units proposed times the applicable Fair <PRTPAGE P="281"/>Market Rent (FMR) of each unit times the term of the grant.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of grant.</E> (1) The grant amount will be reserved for rental assistance over the grant period. An applicant's grant request is an estimate of the amount needed for rental assistance. Recipients will make draws from the reserved amount to pay the actual costs of rental assistance for program participants. For TRA, on demonstration of need, up to 25 percent of the total rental assistance awarded may be spent in any one of the five years, or a higher percentage if approved by HUD, where the applicant provides evidence satisfactory to HUD that it is financially committed to providing the housing assistance described in the application for the full five-year period.</P>
                <P>(2) A recipient must serve at least as many participants as shown in its application. Where the grant amount reserved for rental assistance over the grant period exceeds the amount that will be needed to pay the actual costs of rental assistance, due to such factor as contract rents being lower than FMRs and participants are being able to pay a portion of the rent, recipients may use the remaining funds for the costs of administering the housing assistance, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, for damage to property, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, for covering the costs of rent increases, or for serving a great number of participants.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Vacancies.</E> (1) If a unit assisted under this part is vacated before the expiration of the occupancy agreement described in § 582.315 of this part, the assistance for the unit may continue for a maximum of 30 days from the end of the month in which the unit was vacated, unless occupied by another eligible person. No additional assistance will be paid until the unit is occupied by another eligible person.</P>
                <P>(2) As used in this paragraph (d), the term “vacate” does not include brief periods of inpatient care, not to exceed 90 days for each occurrence.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> (1) Up to eight percent of the grant amount may be used to pay the costs of administering the housing assistance. Recipients may contract with another entity approved by HUD to administer the housing assistance.</P>

                <P>(2) Eligible administrative activities include processing rental payments to landlords, examining participant income and family composition, providing housing information and assistance, inspecting units for compliance with housing quality standards, and receiving into the program new participants. This administrative allowance does not include the cost of administering the supportive services or the grant (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> costs of preparing the application, reports or audits required by HUD), which are not eligible activities under a S+C grant.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Property damage.</E> Recipients may use grant funds in an amount up to one month's rent to pay for any damage to housing due to the action of a participant.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Matching requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Matching rental assistance with supportive services.</E> (1) To qualify for rental assistance grants, an applicant must certify that it will provide or ensure the provision of supportive services, including funding the services itself if the planned resources do not become available for any reason, appropriate to the needs of the population being served, and at least equal in value to the aggregate amount of rental assistance funded by HUD. The supportive services may be newly created for the program or already in operation, and may be provided or funded by other Federal, State, local, or private programs in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 11403b. This statute provides that a recipient may use funds from any source, including any other Federal source (but excluding the specific statutory subtitle from which S+C funds are provided), as well as State, local, and private sources, provided that funds from the other source are not statutorily prohibited to be used as a match.</P>
                <P>(2) Only services that are provided after the execution of the grant agreement may count toward the match.</P>

                <P>(3) It is the responsibility of the recipient to ensure that any funds or services used to satisfy the matching <PRTPAGE P="282"/>requirements of this section are eligible under the laws governing the funds or services to be used as matching funds or services for a grant awarded under this program.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Availability to participants.</E> Recipients must give reasonable assurances that supportive services will be available to participants for the entire term of the rental assistance. The value of the services provided to a participant, however, does not have to equal the amount of rental assistance provided that participant, nor does the value have to be equal to the amount of rental assistance on a year-to-year basis.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculating the value of supportive services.</E> In calculating the amount of the matching supportive services, applicants may count:</P>
                <P>(1) Salaries paid to staff of the recipient to provide supportive services to S+C participants;</P>
                <P>(2) The value of supportive services provided by other persons or organizations to S+C participants;</P>
                <P>(3) The value of time and services contributed by volunteers at the rate of $10.00 an hour, except for donated professional services which may be counted at the customary charge for the service provided (professional services are services ordinarily performed by donors for payment, such as the services of health professionals, that are equivalent to the services they provide in their occupations);</P>
                <P>(4) The value of any lease on a building used for the provision of supportive services, provided the value included in the match is no more than the prorated share used for the program; and</P>
                <P>(5) The cost of outreach activities, as described in § 582.325(a) of this part.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Current occupants.</E> Current occupants of the real property are not eligible for assistance under this part. However, as described in § 582.335, persons displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project under the S+C program are eligible for and must be provided relocation assistance at Uniform Relocation Act levels.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of assistance provided within a jurisdiction.</E> HUD will limit the amount of assistance provided within the jurisdiction of any one unit of local government to no more than 10 percent of the amount available.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Faith-based activities.</E> (1) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in the S+C program. Neither the Federal government nor a State or local government receiving funds under S+C programs shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation.</P>
                <P>(2) Organizations that are directly funded under the S+C program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization as part of the programs or services funded under this part. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded under this part, and participation must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of the HUD-funded programs or services.</P>
                <P>(3) A religious organization that participates in the S+C program will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct S+C funds to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide S+C-funded services, without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, an S+C-funded religious organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</P>

                <P>(4) An organization that participates in the S+C program shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against a program beneficiary or <PRTPAGE P="283"/>prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.</P>
                <P>(5) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maintenance of effort.</E> No assistance received under this part (or any State or local government funds used to supplement this assistance) may be used to replace funds provided under any State or local government assistance programs previously used, or designated for use, to assist persons with disabilities, homeless persons, or homeless persons with disabilities.</P>

Funded applicants must certify in a grant agreement that they are following the HUD-approved consolidated plan. If the applicant is a State, and the project will be located in a unit of general local government that is required to have, or has, a complete consolidated plan, or that is applying for Shelter Plus Care assistance under the same Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) and will have an abbreviated consolidated plan with respect to that application, the State also must submit a certification by the unit of general local government that the State's application is consistent with the unit of general local government's HUD-approved consolidated plan.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicants that are not States or units of general local government.</E> The applicant must submit a certification by the jurisdiction in which the proposed project will be located that the jurisdiction is following its HUD-approved consolidated plan and the applicant's application for funding is consistent with the jurisdiction's HUD-approved consolidated plan. The certification must be made by the unit of general local government or the State, in accordance with the consistency certification provisions of the consolidated plan regulations, 24 CFR part 91, subpart F.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Indian tribes and the Insular Areas of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.</E> These entities are not required to have a consolidated plan or to make consolidated plan certifications. An application by an Indian tribe or other applicant for a project that will be located on a reservation of an Indian tribe will not require a certification by the tribe or the State.

                <P>(a) Activities under this part are subject to HUD environmental regulations in part 58 of this title, except that HUD will perform an environmental review in accordance with part 50 of this title prior to its approval of any conditionally selected applications from PHAs for Fiscal Year 2000 and prior years for other than the SRO component. For activities under a grant to a PHA that generally would be subject to review under part 58, HUD may make a finding in accordance with § 58.11(d) and may itself perform the environmental review under the provisions of part 50 of this title if the recipient PHA objects in writing to the responsible entity's performing the review under part 58. Irrespective of whether the responsible entity in accord with part 58 (or HUD in accord with part 50) performs the environmental review, the recipient shall supply all available, relevant information necessary for the responsible entity (or HUD, if applicable) to perform for each property any environmental review required by this part. The recipient also shall carry out mitigating measures required by the responsible entity (or HUD, if applicable) or select alternate eligible property. HUD may eliminate from consideration any application that would require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</P>

                <P>(b) The recipient, its project partners and their contractors may not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair, dispose of, demolish, or construct property for a project under this part, or commit or expend HUD or local funds for such eligible activities under this part, until the responsible entity (as defined in § 58.2 of this title) has completed the environmental review procedures required by part 58 and the environmental certification and RROF have been approved or HUD has performed an environmental review under part 50 and the recipient has received HUD approval of the property. HUD will not release grant funds if the recipient or any other party commits grant funds (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> incurs any costs or expenditures to be paid or reimbursed with such funds) before the recipient submits and HUD approves its RROF (where such submission is required).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Participation of homeless individuals.</E> (1) Each recipient must provide for the consultation and participation of not less than one homeless individual or formerly homeless individual on the board of directors or other equivalent policy-making entity of the recipient, to the extent that the entity considers and makes policies and decisions regarding any housing assisted under this part or services for the participants. This requirement is waived if the applicant is unable to meet the requirement and presents a plan, which HUD approves, to otherwise consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making such policies and decisions. Participation by such an individual who also is a participant under the program does not constitute a conflict of interest under § 582.340(b) of this part.</P>

                <P>(2) To the maximum extent practicable, each recipient must involve homeless individuals and families, through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, in constructing or rehabilitating housing assisted under this part and in providing supportive services required under § 582.215 of this part.<PRTPAGE P="285"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Ongoing assessment of housing and supportive services.</E> Each recipient of assistance must conduct an ongoing assessment of the housing assistance and supportive services required by the participants, and make adjustments as appropriate.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Records and reports.</E> (1) Each recipient must keep any records and, within the timeframe required, make any reports (including those pertaining to race, ethnicity, gender, and disability status data) that HUD may require.</P>
                <P>(2) Each recipient must keep on file, and make available to the public on request, a description of the procedures used to select sponsors under the SRA component and buildings under the SRO, SRA, and PRA components.</P>
                <P>(3) Each recipient must develop, and make available to the public upon request, its procedures for managing the rental housing assistance funds provided by HUD. At a minimum, such procedures must describe how units will be identified and selected; how the responsibility for inspections will be handled; the process for deciding which unit a participant will occupy; how participants will be placed in, or assisted in finding appropriate housing; how rent calculations will be made and the amount of rental assistance payments determined; and what safeguards will be used to prevent the misuse of funds.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Homeless status.</E> The recipient must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure compliance with the homeless definition in § 582.5. The procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify homeless status. The procedures must establish the order of priority for obtaining evidence as third-party documentation first, intake worker observations second, and certification from the person seeking assistance third. However, lack of third-party documentation must not prevent an individual or family from being immediately admitted to emergency shelter, receiving street outreach services, or being immediately admitted to shelter or receiving services provided by a victim service provider, as defined in section 401(32) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act. Records contained in an HMIS or comparable database used by victim service or legal service providers are acceptable evidence of third-party documentation and intake worker observations if the HMIS retains an auditable history of all entries, including the person who entered the data, the date of entry, and the change made; and if the HMIS prevents overrides or changes of the dates entries are made.</P>
                <P>(1) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, acceptable evidence includes a written observation by an outreach worker of the conditions where the individual or family was living, a written referral by another housing or service provider, or a certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) If the individual qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(iii) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, because he or she resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation and is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less, acceptable evidence includes the evidence described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and one of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Discharge paperwork or a written or oral referral from a social worker, case manager, or other appropriate official of the institution, stating the beginning and end dates of the time residing in the institution. All oral statements must be recorded by the intake worker; or</P>

                <P>(ii) Where the evidence in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not obtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain the evidence described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) and a certification by <PRTPAGE P="286"/>the individual seeking assistance that states he or she is exiting or has just exited an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less.</P>
                <P>(3) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (2) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, because the individual or family will imminently lose their housing, the evidence must include:</P>
                <P>(i)(A) A court order resulting from an eviction action that requires the individual or family to leave their residence within 14 days after the date of their application for homeless assistance; or the equivalent notice under applicable state law, a Notice to Quit, or a Notice to Terminate issued under state law;</P>
                <P>(B) For individuals and families whose primary nighttime residence is a hotel or motel room not paid for by charitable organizations or federal, state, or local government programs for low-income individuals, evidence that the individual or family lacks the resources necessary to reside there for more than 14 days after the date of application for homeless assistance; or</P>
                <P>(C) An oral statement by the individual or head of household that the owner or renter of the housing in which they currently reside will not allow them to stay for more than 14 days after the date of application for homeless assistance. The intake worker must record the statement and certify that it was found credible. To be found credible, the oral statement must either: (I) Be verified by the owner or renter of the housing in which the individual or family resides at the time of application for homeless assistance and be documented by a written certification by the owner or renter or by the intake worker's recording of the owner or renter's oral statement; or (II) if the intake worker is unable to contact the owner or renter, be documented by a written certification by the intake worker of his or her due diligence in attempting to obtain the owner or renter's verification and the written certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that his or her statement was true and complete;</P>
                <P>(ii) Certification by the individual or head of household that no subsequent residence has been identified; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Certification or other written documentation that the individual or family lacks the resources and support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing.</P>
                <P>(4) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (3) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, because the individual or family does not otherwise qualify as homeless under the homeless definition but is an unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age, or homeless family with one or more children or youth, and is defined as homeless under another Federal statute or section 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)), the evidence must include:</P>

                <P>(i) For paragraph (3)(i) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, certification of homeless status by the local private nonprofit organization or state or local governmental entity responsible for administering assistance under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), subtitle N of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e <E T="03">et seq.</E>), section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786), or subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as applicable;</P>
                <P>(ii) For paragraph (3)(ii) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, referral by a housing or service provider, written observation by an outreach worker, or certification by the homeless individual or head of household seeking assistance;</P>

                <P>(iii) For paragraph (3)(iii) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, certification by the individual or head of household and any available supporting documentation that the individual or family moved two or more times during the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of application for homeless assistance, including: Recorded statements or records obtained from each owner or renter of housing, <PRTPAGE P="287"/>provider of shelter or housing, or social worker, case worker, or other appropriate official of a hospital or institution in which the individual or family resided; or, where these statements or records are unobtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain these statements or records. Where a move was due to the individual or family fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, then the intake worker may alternatively obtain a written certification from the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they were fleeing that situation and that they resided at that address; and</P>
                <P>(iv) For paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, written diagnosis from a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition (or intake staff-recorded observation of disability that within 45 days of the date of application for assistance is confirmed by a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition); employment records; department of corrections records; literacy, English proficiency tests; or other reasonable documentation of the conditions required under paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition.</P>
                <P>(5) If the individual or family qualifies under paragraph (4) of the homeless definition in § 582.5, because the individual or family is fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions related to violence, then acceptable evidence includes an oral statement by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they are fleeing that situation, that no subsequent residence has been identified, and that they lack the resources or support networks, e.g., family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain other housing. If the individual or family is receiving shelter or services provided by a victim service provider, as defined in section 401(32) of the McKinney-Vento-Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act, the oral statement must be documented by either a certification by the individual or head of household, or a certification by the intake worker. Otherwise, the oral statement that the individual or head of household seeking assistance has not identified a subsequent residence and lacks the resources or support networks, e.g., family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain housing must be documented by a certification by the individual or head of household that the oral statement is true and complete, and, where the safety of the individual or family would not be jeopardized, the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking or other dangerous or life-threatening condition must be verified by a written observation by the intake worker or a written referral by a housing or service provider, social worker, health-care provider, law enforcement agency, legal assistance provider, pastoral counselor, or any other organization from whom the individual or head of household has sought assistance for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The written referral or observation need only include the minimum amount of information necessary to document that the individual or family is fleeing, or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Disability.</E>—Each recipient of assistance under this part must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure that the assistance benefits persons with disabilities, as defined in § 582.5. In addition to the documentation required under paragraph (b), the procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify the disability of the person applying for homeless assistance. The recipient must keep these records for 5 years after the end of the grant term. Acceptable evidence of the disability includes:</P>
                <P>(1) Written verification of the disability from a professional licensed by the state to diagnose and treat the disability and his or her certification that the disability is expected to be long-continuing or of indefinite duration and substantially impedes the individual's ability to live independently;</P>

                <P>(2) Written verification from the Social Security Administration;<PRTPAGE P="288"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The receipt of a disability check (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance check or Veteran Disability Compensation);</P>
                <P>(4) Intake staff-recorded observation of disability that, no later than 45 days of the application for assistance, is confirmed and accompanied by evidence in paragraph (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(5) Other documentation approved by HUD.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Housing quality standards.</E> Housing assisted under this part must meet the applicable housing quality standards (HQS) under § 982.401 of this title—except that § 982.401(j) of this title does not apply and instead part 35, subparts A, B, K and R of this title apply—and, for SRO under § 882.803(b) of this title. Before any assistance will be provided on behalf of a participant, the recipient, or another entity acting on behalf of the recipient (other than the owner of the housing), must physically inspect each unit to assure that the unit meets the HQS. Assistance will not be provided for units that fail to meet the HQS, unless the owner corrects any deficiencies within 30 days from the date of the lease agreement and the recipient verifies that all deficiencies have been corrected. Recipients must also inspect all units at least annually during the grant period to ensure that the units continue to meet the HQS.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rent reasonableness.</E> HUD will only provide assistance for a unit for which the rent is reasonable. For TRA, PRA, and SRA, it is the responsibility of the recipient to determine whether the rent charged for the unit receiving rental assistance is reasonable in relation to rents being charged for comparable unassisted units, taking into account the location, size, type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management and maintenance of each unit, as well as not in excess of rents currently being charged by the same owner for comparable unassisted units. For SRO, rents are calculated in accordance with 24 CFR 882.805(g).</P>

Recipients must exercise judgment and examine all extenuating circumstances in determining when violations are serious enough to warrant termination, so that a participant's assistance is terminated only in the most severe cases. Recipients are not prohibited from resuming assistance to a participant whose assistance has been terminated.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Due process.</E> In terminating assistance to a participant, the recipient must provide a formal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance to due process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:</P>

                <P>Recipients must use their best efforts to ensure that eligible hard-to-reach persons are served by S+C. Recipients are expected to make sustained efforts to engage eligible persons so that they may be brought into the program. Outreach should be primarily directed toward eligible persons who have a nighttime residence that is an emergency shelter or a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> persons living in cars, streets, and parks). Outreach activities are considered to be a supportive service, and the value of such activities that occur after the execution of the grant agreement may be included in meeting the matching requirement.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Recipients may establish a preference as part of their admissions procedures for one or more of the statutorily targeted populations (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> seriously mentally ill, alcohol or substance abusers, or persons with AIDS and related diseases). However, other eligible disabled homeless persons must be considered for housing designed for the target population unless the recipient can demonstrate that there is sufficient demand by the target population for the units, and other eligible disabled homeless persons would not benefit from the primary supportive services provided.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance with requirements.</E> (1) In addition to the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, recipients serving a designated population of homeless persons must, within the designated population, comply with the prohibitions against discrimination against handicapped individuals under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 41 CFR chapter 60-741.</P>
                <P>(2) The nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements set forth at part 5 of this title are modified as follows:</P>

When an IHA is established under State law, the applicability of the Indian Civil Rights Act will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Projects subject to the Indian Civil Rights Act must be developed and operated in compliance with its provisions and all implementing HUD requirements, instead of title VI and the Fair Housing Act and their implementing regulations.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with, the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for supportive housing is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibility of recipient.</E> (1) The recipient must certify (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> provide assurance of compliance) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and must ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the recipient to comply with these provisions.</P>
                <P>(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs also may be paid for with local public funds or funds available from other sources.</P>
                <P>(3) The recipient must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with provisions of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the recipient's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the recipient's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property permanently as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for supportive housing project assisted under this part. The term “displaced person” includes, but may not be limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) A person that moves permanently from the real property after the property owner (or person in control of the site) issues a vacate notice or refuses to renew an expiring lease, if the move occurs on or after:</P>
                <P>(A) The date that the recipient submits to HUD an application for assistance that is later approved and funded, if the recipient has control of the project site; or</P>
                <P>(B) The date that the recipient obtains control of the project site, if such control is obtained after the submission of the application to HUD.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if the recipient or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.</P>

                <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves permanently from the building/complex on or after the date of the “initiation of negotiations” (see paragraph (g) of this section) if the <PRTPAGE P="291"/>move occurs before the tenant has been provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant's monthly rent before the initiation of negotiations and estimated average utility costs, or</P>
                <P>(B) 30 percent of gross household income. If the initial rent is at or near the maximum, there must be a reasonable basis for concluding at the time the project is initiated that future rent increases will be modest.</P>
                <P>(iv) A tenant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) A tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or</P>
                <P>(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</P>
                <P>(v) A tenant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another unit in the same building/complex, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>
                <P>(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
                <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local or tribal law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance provided under this section), if the project is approved;</P>
                <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
                <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
                <P>(3) The recipient may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement between the recipient and HUD, or selection of the project site, if later.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Other Federal requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>In addition to the Federal requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, the following requirements apply to this program:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Uniform requirements.</E> (1) The policies, guidelines, and requirements of 24 CFR part 85 (as revised April 1, 2013) apply to the acceptance and use of assistance under the program by governmental entities and 24 CFR part 84 (as revised April 1, 2013) apply to the acceptance and use of assistance by private nonprofit organizations, except where inconsistent with provisions of the McKinney Act, other Federal statutes, or this part.</P>

                <P>(2) The financial management systems used by recipients under this program must provide for audits in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. Private nonprofit organizations who are subrecipients are subject to the audit requirements <PRTPAGE P="292"/>of 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. HUD may perform or require additional audits as it finds necessary or appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflict of interest.</E> (1) In addition to the conflict of interest requirements in 24 CFR part 85 (as revised April 1, 2013), no person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the recipient and who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to assisted activities, or who is in a position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for himself or herself or for those with whom he or she has family or business ties, during his or her tenure or for one year thereafter. Participation by homeless individuals who also are participants under the program in policy or decisionmaking under § 582.300 of this part does not constitute a conflict of interest.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determine that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's project. An exception may be considered only after the recipient has provided the following:</P>
                <P>(i) For States, units of general local governments, PHAs and IHAs, a disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>
                <P>(ii) For all recipients, an opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law.</P>
                <P>(3) In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, HUD will consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the project which would otherwise not be available;</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of eligible persons and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
                <P>(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;</P>
                <P>(v) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</P>
                <P>(vi) Any other relevant considerations.</P>

After the initial obligation of funds, HUD is under no obligation to make any upward revisions to the grant amount for any approved assistance.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Deobligation.</E> (1) HUD may deobligate all or a portion of the approved grant amount if such amount is not expended in a timely manner, or the proposed housing for which funding was approved or the supportive services proposed in the application are not provided in accordance with the approved application, the requirements of this part, and other applicable HUD regulations. The grant agreement may set forth other circumstances under which funds may be deobligated, and other sanctions may be imposed.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD may readvertise, in a notice of fund availability, the availability of funds that have been deobligated, or may reconsider applications that were submitted in response to the most recently published notice of fund availability and select applications for funding with the deobligated funds. Such selections would be made in accordance with the selection process described in § 582.220 of this part. Any selections made using deobligated funds will be subject to applicable appropriation act requirements governing the use of deobligated funding authority.</P>

Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide Supportive Housing Program-funded services, without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a Supportive Housing Program-funded religious organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</P>
                <P>(4) An organization that participates in the Supportive Housing Program shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.</P>

                <P>(5) Program funds may not be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those structures are used for inherently religious activities. Program <PRTPAGE P="300"/>funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under this part. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently religious activities, program funds may not exceed the cost of those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to Supportive Housing Program funds in this part. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a Supportive Housing Program-funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of worship, however, are ineligible for Supportive Housing Program-funded improvements. Disposition of real property after the term of the grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (<E T="03">see</E> 24 CFR parts 84 and 85 (as revised April 1, 2013)).</P>
                <P>(6) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Participant control of site.</E> Where an applicant does not propose to have control of a site or sites but rather proposes to assist a homeless family or individual in obtaining a lease, which may include assistance with rent payments and receiving supportive services, after which time the family or individual remains in the same housing without further assistance under this part, that applicant may not request assistance for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction.</P>

                <P>(a) Activities under this part are subject to HUD environmental regulations in part 58 of this title, except that HUD will perform an environmental review in accordance with part 50 of this title prior to its approval of any conditionally selected applications for Fiscal Year 2000 and prior years that were received directly from private nonprofit entities and governmental entities with special or limited purpose powers. For activities under a grant that generally would be subject to review under part 58, HUD may make a finding in accordance with § 58.11(d) and may itself perform the environmental review under the provisions of part 50 of this title if the recipient objects in writing to the responsible entity's performing the review under part 58. Irrespective of whether the responsible entity in accord with part 58 (or HUD in accord with part 50) performs the environmental review, the recipient shall supply all available, relevant information necessary for the responsible entity (or HUD, if applicable) to perform for each property any environmental review required by this part. The recipient also shall carry out mitigating measures required by the responsible entity (or HUD, if applicable) or select alternate eligible property. HUD may eliminate from consideration any application that would require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</P>

                <P>(b) The recipient, its project partners and their contractors may not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair, dispose of, demolish or construct property for a project under this part, or commit or expend HUD or local funds for such eligible activities under this part, until the responsible entity (as defined in § 58.2 of this title) has completed the environmental review procedures required by part 58 and the environmental certification and RROF have been approved or HUD has performed an environmental review under part 50 and the recipient has received HUD approval of the property. HUD will not release grant funds if the recipient or any other party commits grant funds (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> incurs any costs or expenditures to be paid or reimbursed with such funds) before the recipient submits and HUD approves its RROF (where such submission is required).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Renewal grants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Grants made under this part, and grants made under subtitles C and D (the Supportive Housing Demonstration and SAFAH, respectively) of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act as in effect before October 28, 1992, may be renewed on a noncompetitive basis to continue ongoing leasing, operations, and supportive services for additional years beyond the initial funding period. To be considered for renewal funding for leasing, operating costs, or supportive services, recipients must submit a request for such funding in the form specified by HUD, must meet the requirements of this part, and must submit requests within the time period established by HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Assistance available.</E> The first renewal will be for a period of time not to exceed the difference between the end of the initial funding period and ten years from the date of initial occupancy or the date of initial service provision, as applicable. Any subsequent renewal will be for a period of time not to exceed five years. Assistance during each year of the renewal period, subject to maintenance of effort requirements under § 583.150(a) may be for:</P>
                <P>(1) Up to 50 percent of the actual operating and leasing costs in the final year of the initial funding period;</P>
                <P>(2) Up to the amount of HUD assistance for supportive services in the final year of the initial funding period; and</P>
                <P>(3) An allowance for cost increases.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">HUD review.</E> (1) HUD will review the request for renewal and will evaluate the recipient's performance in previous years against the plans and goals established in the initial application for assistance, as amended. HUD will approve the request for renewal unless the recipient proposes to serve a population that is not homeless, or the recipient has not shown adequate <PRTPAGE P="302"/>progress as evidenced by an unacceptably slow expenditure of funds, or the recipient has been unsuccessful in assisting participants in achieving and maintaining independent living. In determining the recipient's success in assisting participants to achieve and maintain independent living, consideration will be given to the level and type of problems of participants. For recipients with a poor record of success, HUD will also consider the recipient's willingness to accept technical assistance and to make changes suggested by technical assistance providers. Other factors which will affect HUD's decision to approve a renewal request include the following: a continuing history of inadequate financial management accounting practices, indications of mismanagement on the part of the recipient, a drastic reduction in the population served by the recipient, program changes made by the recipient without prior HUD approval, and loss of project site.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD reserves the right to reject a request from any organization with an outstanding obligation to HUD that is in arrears or for which a payment schedule has not been agreed to, or whose response to an audit finding is overdue or unsatisfactory.</P>
                <P>(3) HUD will notify the recipient in writing that the request has been approved or disapproved.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Homeless status.</E> The recipient must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure compliance with the homeless definition in § 583.5. The procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify homeless status. The procedures must establish the order of priority for obtaining evidence as third-party documentation first, intake worker observations second, and certification from the person seeking assistance third. However, lack of third-party documentation must not prevent an individual or family from being immediately admitted to emergency shelter, receiving street outreach services, or being immediately admitted to shelter or receiving services provided by a victim service provider, as defined in section 401(32) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act. Records contained in an HMIS or comparable database used by victim service or legal service providers are acceptable evidence of third-party documentation and intake worker observations if the HMIS retains an auditable history of all entries, including the person who entered the data, the date of entry, and the change made; and if the HMIS prevents overrides or changes of the dates on which entries are made.</P>
                <P>(1) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, acceptable evidence includes a written observation by an outreach worker of the conditions where the individual or family was living, a written referral by another housing or service provider, or a certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) If the individual qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(iii) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, because he or she resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation and is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less, acceptable evidence includes the evidence described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and one of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Discharge paperwork or a written or oral referral from a social worker, case manager, or other appropriate official of the institution, stating the beginning and end dates of the time residing in the institution. All oral statements must be recorded by the intake worker; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Where the evidence in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not obtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain the evidence described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) and a certification by the individual seeking assistance that states he or she is exiting or has just exited an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less.</P>
                <P>(3) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (2) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, because the individual or family will imminently lose their housing, the evidence must include:</P>

                <P>(i)(A) A court order resulting from an eviction action that requires the individual or family to leave their residence within 14 days after the date of their application for homeless assistance; or the equivalent notice under applicable state law, a Notice to Quit, or a Notice to Terminate issued under state law;<PRTPAGE P="305"/>
                </P>
                <P>(B) For individuals and families whose primary nighttime residence is a hotel or motel room not paid for by charitable organizations or federal, state, or local government programs for low-income individuals, evidence that the individual or family lacks the resources necessary to reside there for more than 14 days after the date of application for homeless assistance; or</P>
                <P>(C) An oral statement by the individual or head of household that the owner or renter of the housing in which they currently reside will not allow them to stay for more than 14 days after the date of application for homeless assistance. The intake worker must record the statement and certify that it was found credible. To be found credible, the oral statement must either: Be verified by the owner or renter of the housing in which the individual or family resides at the time of application for homeless assistance and documented by a written certification by the owner or renter or by the intake worker's recording of the owner or renter's oral statement; or if the intake worker is unable to contact the owner or renter, be documented by a written certification by the intake worker of his or her due diligence in attempting to obtain the owner or renter's verification and the written certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that his or her statement was true and complete;</P>
                <P>(ii) Certification by the individual or head of household that no subsequent residence has been identified; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Certification or other written documentation that the individual or family lacks the resources and support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing.</P>
                <P>(4) If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (3) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, because the individual or family does not otherwise qualify as homeless under the homeless definition but is an unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age, or homeless family with one or more children or youth, and is defined as homeless under another Federal statute or section 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)), the evidence must include:</P>

                <P>(i) For paragraph (3)(i) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, certification of homeless status by the local private nonprofit organization or state or local governmental entity responsible for administering assistance under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), subtitle N of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e <E T="03">et seq.</E>), section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786), or subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as applicable;</P>

                <P>(iii) For paragraph (3)(iii) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, certification by the individual or head of household and any available supporting documentation that the individual or family moved two or more times during the 60-day period immediately preceding the date for application of homeless assistance, including: Recorded statements or records obtained from each owner or renter of housing, provider of shelter or housing, or social worker, case worker, or other appropriate official of a hospital or institution in which the individual or family resided; or, where these statements or records are unobtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain these statements or records. Where a move was due to the individual or family fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, then the intake worker may alternatively obtain a written certification from the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they were fleeing that situation and that they resided at that address; and</P>

                <P>(iv) For paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, written <PRTPAGE P="306"/>diagnosis from a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition (or intake staff-recorded observation of disability that within 45 days of the date of application for assistance is confirmed by a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition); employment records; department of corrections records; literacy, English proficiency tests; or other reasonable documentation of the conditions required under paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition.</P>
                <P>(5) If the individual or family qualifies under paragraph (4) of the homeless definition in § 583.5, because the individual or family is fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions related to violence, then acceptable evidence includes an oral statement by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they are fleeing that situation, that no subsequent residence has been identified, and that they lack the resources or support networks, e.g., family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain other housing. If the individual or family is receiving shelter or services provided by a victim service provider, as defined in section 401(32) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act, the oral statement must be documented by either a certification by the individual or head of household; or a certification by the intake worker. Otherwise, the oral statement that the individual or head of household seeking assistance has not identified a subsequent residence and lacks the resources or support networks, e.g., family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain housing, must be documented by a certification by the individual or head of household that the oral statement is true and complete, and, where the safety of the individual or family would not be jeopardized, the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening condition must be verified by a written observation by the intake worker; or a written referral by a housing or service provider, social worker, health-care provider, law enforcement agency, legal assistance provider, pastoral counselor, or any another organization from whom the individual or head of household has sought assistance for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The written referral or observation need only include the minimum amount of information necessary to document that the individual or family is fleeing, or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Disability.</E>—Each recipient of assistance under this part must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure that the assistance benefits persons with disabilities, as defined in § 583.5. In addition to the documentation required under paragraph (b) of this section, the procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify the disability of the person applying for homeless assistance. The recipient must keep these records for 5 years after the end of the grant term. Acceptable evidence of the disability includes:</P>
                <P>(1) Written verification of the disability from a professional licensed by the state to diagnose and treat the disability and his or her certification that the disability is expected to be long-continuing or of indefinite duration and substantially impedes the individual's ability to live independently;</P>
                <P>(2) Written verification from the Social Security Administration;</P>
                <P>(3) The receipt of a disability check (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance check or Veteran Disability Compensation);</P>
                <P>(4) Other documentation approved by HUD; or</P>
                <P>(5) Intake staff-recorded observation of disability that, no later than 45 days of the application for assistance, is confirmed and accompanied by evidence in paragraph (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Minimizing displacement.</E> Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, recipients must assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of supportive housing assisted under this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with, the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for supportive housing is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibility of recipient.</E> (1) The recipient must certify (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> provide assurance of compliance) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and must ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the recipient to comply with these provisions.</P>
                <P>(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs also may be paid for with local public funds or funds available from other sources.</P>
                <P>(3) The recipient must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with provisions of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the recipient's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the recipient's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property permanently as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for supportive housing projects assisted under this part. The term “displaced person” includes, but may not be limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) A person that moves permanently from the real property after the property owner (or person in control of the site) issues a vacate notice, or refuses to renew an expiring lease in order to evade the responsibility to provide relocation assistance, if the move occurs on or after the date the recipient submits to HUD the application or application amendment designating the project site.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if the recipient or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.</P>

                <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves permanently from the building/complex on or after the date of the “initiation of negotiations” (see paragraph (g) of this section) if the move occurs before the tenant has been provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly <PRTPAGE P="308"/>utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant's monthly rent before the initiation of negotiations and estimated average utility costs, or</P>
                <P>(B) 30 percent of gross household income. If the initial rent is at or near the maximum, there must be a reasonable basis for concluding at the time the project is initiated that future rent increases will be modest.</P>
                <P>(iv) A tenant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) A tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or</P>
                <P>(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</P>
                <P>(v) A tenant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another unit in the same building/complex, if either:</P>
                <P>(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>
                <P>(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
                <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local or tribal law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance provided under this section), if the project is approved;</P>
                <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
                <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
                <P>(3) The recipient may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement between the recipient and HUD.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Definition of project.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “project” means an undertaking paid for in whole or in part with assistance under this part. Two or more activities that are integrally related, each essential to the others, are considered a single project, whether or not all component activities receive assistance under this part.</P>

                <P>(1) 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors include the number of people in the family, age of family members, medical expenses and child care expenses). The calculation of the family's monthly adjusted income must include the expense deductions provided in 24 CFR 5.611(a), and for persons with disabilities, the calculation of the family's monthly adjusted income also must include the disallowance of earned income as provided in 24 CFR 5.617, if applicable;</P>

If such site control is not demonstrated within one year after initial notification of the award of assistance under this part, the grant will be deobligated as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Notwithstanding the permissibility of proposals that serve designated populations of disabled homeless persons, recipients serving a designated population of disabled homeless persons are required, within the designated population, to comply with these requirements for nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status, and disability.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements.</E> The nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements set forth at part 5 of this title apply to this program. The Indian Civil Rights Act (25 U.S.C. 1301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) applies to tribes when they exercise their powers of self-government, and to Indian housing authorities (IHAs) when established by the exercise of such powers. When an IHA is established under State law, the applicability of the Indian Civil Rights Act will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Projects subject to the Indian Civil Rights Act must be developed and operated in compliance with its provisions and all implementing HUD requirements, instead of title VI and the Fair Housing Act and their implementing regulations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (1) If the procedures that the recipient intends to use to make known the availability of the supportive housing are unlikely to reach persons of any particular race, <PRTPAGE P="310"/>color, religion, sex, age, national origin, familial status, or handicap who may qualify for admission to the housing, the recipient must establish additional procedures that will ensure that such persons can obtain information concerning availability of the housing.</P>
                <P>(2) The recipient must adopt procedures to make available information on the existence and locations of facilities and services that are accessible to persons with a handicap and maintain evidence of implementation of the procedures.</P>

                <P>(1) All new construction must meet the accessibility requirements of 24 CFR 8.22 and, as applicable, 24 CFR 100.205.</P>
                <P>(2) Projects in which costs of rehabilitation are 75 percent or more of the replacement cost of the building must meet the requirements of 24 CFR 8.23(a). Other rehabilitation must meet the requirements of 24 CFR 8.23(b).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Flood insurance.</E> (1) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4001-4128) prohibits the approval of applications for assistance for acquisition or construction (including rehabilitation) for supportive housing located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as having special flood hazards, unless:</P>
                <P>(i) The community in which the area is situated is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (see 44 CFR parts 59 through 79), or less than a year has passed since FEMA notification regarding such hazards; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Flood insurance is obtained as a condition of approval of the application.</P>
                <P>(2) Applicants with supportive housing located in an area identified by FEMA as having special flood hazards and receiving assistance for acquisition or construction (including rehabilitation) are responsible for assuring that flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program is obtained and maintained.</P>

                <P>(b) The Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (16 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) may apply to proposals under this part, depending on the assistance requested.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Uniform requirements.</E> The policies, guidelines, and requirements of 24 CFR part 85 (as revised April 1, 2013) apply to the award, acceptance, and use of assistance under the program by governmental entities, and 24 CFR part 84 (as revised April 1, 2013) apply to the acceptance and use of assistance by private nonprofit organizations, except where inconsistent with the provisions of the McKinney Act, other Federal statutes, or this part.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Lead-based paint.</E> The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at part 35, subparts A, B, J, K, and R of this title apply to activities under this program.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (1) In addition to the conflict of interest requirements in 24 CFR part 85 (as revised April 1, 2013), no person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the recipient and who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to assisted activities, or who is in a position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for himself or herself or for those with whom he or she has family or business ties, during his or her tenure or for one year thereafter. Participation by homeless individuals who also are participants under the program in <PRTPAGE P="311"/>policy or decisionmaking under § 583.300(f) does not constitute a conflict of interest.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's project. An exception may be considered only after the recipient has provided the following:</P>
                <P>(i) For States and other governmental entities, a disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>
                <P>(ii) For all recipients, an opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law.</P>
                <P>(3) In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the requirement of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, HUD will consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the project which would otherwise not be available;</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of eligible persons and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
                <P>(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;</P>
                <P>(v) Whether undue hardship will result either to the recipient or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</P>
                <P>(vi) Any other relevant considerations.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Audit.</E> The financial management systems used by recipients under this program must provide for audits in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. HUD may perform or require additional audits as it finds necessary or appropriate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This part implements the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2687 <E T="03">note</E>), which instituted a new community-based process for addressing the needs of the homeless at base closure and realignment sites. In this process, Local Redevelopment Authorities (LRAs) identify interest from homeless providers in installation property and develop a redevelopment plan for the installation that balances the economic redevelopment and other development needs of the communities in the vicinity of the installation with the needs of the homeless in those communities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reviews the LRA's plan to see that an appropriate balance is achieved. This part also implements the process for identifying interest from State and local entities for property under a public benefit transfer. The LRA is responsible for concurrently identifying interest from homeless providers and State and local entities interested in property under a public benefit transfer.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recognition of the LRA.</E> As soon as practicable after the list of installations recommended for closure or realignment is approved, DoD, through OEA, will recognize an LRA for the installation. Upon recognition, OEA shall publish the name, address, and point of contact for the LRA in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and in a newspaper of general circulation in the communities in the vicinity of the installation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibilities of the Military Department.</E> The Military Department shall make installation properties available to other DoD components and Federal agencies in accordance with the procedures set out at 32 CFR part 175. The Military Department will keep the LRA informed of other Federal interest in the property during this process. Upon completion of this process the Military Department will notify HUD and either the LRA, or the Chief Executive Officer of the State, as appropriate, and publish a list of surplus property on the installation that will be available for reuse in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and a newspaper of general circulation in the communities in the vicinity of the installation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibilities of the LRA.</E> The LRA should begin to conduct outreach efforts with respect to the installation as soon as is practicable after the date of approval of closure/realignment of the installation. The local reuse planning process must begin no later than the date of the Military Department's <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication of available property described at § 586.20(b). For those installations that began the process described in this part prior to August 17, 1995, HUD will, on a case by case basis, determine whether the statutory requirements have been fulfilled and whether any additional requirements listed in this part should be required. Upon the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in § 586.20(b), the LRA shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Publish, within 30 days, in a newspaper of general circulation in the communities in the vicinity of the installation, the time period during which the LRA will receive notices of interest from State and local governments, representatives of the homeless, and other interested parties. This publication shall include the name, address, telephone number and the point of contact for the LRA who can provide information on the prescribed form and contents of the notices of interest. The LRA shall notify DoD of the deadline specified for receipt of notices of interest. LRAs are strongly encouraged to make this publication as soon as possible within the permissible 30 day period in order to expedite the closure process.</P>

              <P>(i) In addition, the LRA has the option to conduct an informal solicitation of notices of interest from public and non-profit entities interested in obtaining property via a public benefit transfer other than a homeless assistance conveyance under either 40 U.S.C. 471 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153. As part of such a solicitation, the LRA may wish to request that interested entities submit a description of the proposed use to the LRA and the sponsoring Federal agency.</P>

              <P>(ii) For all installations selected for closure or realignment prior to 1995 that elected to proceed under Public Law 103-421, the LRA shall accept notices of interest for not less than 30 days.<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) For installations selected for closure or realignment in 1995 or thereafter, notices of interest shall be accepted for a minimum of 90 days and not more than 180 days after the LRA's publication under § 586.20(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) Prescribe the form and contents of notices of interest.</P>
              <P>(i) The LRA may not release to the public any information regarding the capacity of the representative of the homeless to carry out its program, a description of the organization, or its financial plan for implementing the program, without the consent of the representative of the homeless concerned, unless such release is authorized under Federal law and under the law of the State and communities in which the installation concerned is located. The identity of the representative of the homeless may be disclosed.</P>
              <P>(ii) The notices of interest from representatives of the homeless must include:</P>
              <P>(A) A description of the homeless assistance program proposed, including the purposes to which the property or facility will be put, which may include uses such as supportive services, job and skills training, employment programs, shelters, transitional housing or housing with no established limitation on the amount of time of residence, food and clothing banks, treatment facilities, or any other activity which clearly meets an identified need of the homeless and fills a gap in the continuum of care;</P>
              <P>(B) A description of the need for the program;</P>
              <P>(C) A description of the extent to which the program is or will be coordinated with other homeless assistance programs in the communities in the vicinity of the installation;</P>
              <P>(D) Information about the physical requirements necessary to carry out the program including a description of the buildings and property at the installation that are necessary to carry out the program;</P>
              <P>(E) A description of the financial plan, the organization, and the organizational capacity of the representative of the homeless to carry out the program; and</P>
              <P>(F) An assessment of the time required to start carrying out the program.</P>
              <P>(iii) The notices of interest from entities other than representatives of the homeless should specify the name of the entity and specific interest in property or facilities along with a description of the planned use.</P>
              <P>(3) In addition to the notice required under § 586.20(c)(1), undertake outreach efforts to representatives of the homeless by contacting local government officials and other persons or entities that may be interested in assisting the homeless within the vicinity of the installation.</P>
              <P>(i) The LRA may invite persons and organizations identified on the HUD list of representatives of the homeless and any other representatives of the homeless with which the LRA is familiar, operating in the vicinity of the installation, to the workshop described in § 586.20(c)(3)(ii).</P>
              <P>(ii) The LRA, in coordination with the Military Department and HUD, shall conduct at least one workshop where representatives of the homeless have an opportunity to:</P>
              <P>(A) Learn about the closure/realignment and disposal process;</P>
              <P>(B) Tour the buildings and properties available either on or off the installation;</P>

              <P>(D) Learn about any known land use constraints affecting the available property and buildings.</P>
              <P>(iii) The LRA should meet with representatives of the homeless that express interest in discussing possible uses for these properties to alleviate gaps in the continuum of care.</P>
              <P>(4) Consider various properties in response to the notices of interest. The LRA may consider property that is located off the installation.</P>

              <P>(5) Develop an application, including the redevelopment plan and homeless assistance submission, explaining how the LRA proposes to address the needs of the homeless. This application shall consider the notices of interest received from State and local governments, representatives of the homeless, and other interested parties. This shall <PRTPAGE P="317"/>include, but not be limited to, entities eligible for public benefit transfers under either 40 U.S.C. 471 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153; representatives of the homeless; commercial, industrial, and residential development interests; and other interests. From the deadline date for receipt of notices of interest described at § 586.20(c)(1), the LRA shall have 270 days to complete and submit the LRA application to the appropriate Military Department and HUD. The application requirements are described at § 586.30.</P>
              <P>(6) Make the draft application available to the public for review and comment periodically during the process of developing the application. The LRA must conduct at least one public hearing on the application prior to its submission to HUD and the appropriate Military Department. A summary of the public comments received during the process of developing the application shall be included in the application when it is submitted.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Public benefit transfer screening.</E> The LRA should, while conducting its outreach efforts, work with the Federal agencies that sponsor public benefit transfers under either 40 U.S.C. 471 <E T="03">et seq.</E> or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153. Those agencies can provide a list of parties in the vicinity of the installation that might be interested in and eligible for public benefit transfers. The LRA should make a reasonable effort to inform such parties of the availability of the property and incorporate their interests within the planning process. Actual recipients of property are to be determined by the sponsoring Federal agency. The Military Departments shall notify sponsoring Federal agencies about property that is available based on the community redevelopment plan and keep the LRA apprised of any expressions of interest. Such expressions of interest are not required to be incorporated into the redevelopment plan, but must be considered.</P>

Previously, the program had been administered by the Department as a demonstration program under section 123 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (42 U.S.C. 5318 note).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The program is intended to assist communities to become more viable, by providing incentive funds to carry out neighborhood development <PRTPAGE P="322"/>activities that benefit low- and moderate-income families. The program objectives are to increase the capacity of neighborhood organizations, promote long-term financial support for their neighborhood projects, and encourage greater participation of neighborhood organizations with private and public institutions.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Poverty requirement.</E> A nominated area meets the poverty requirement if the poverty rate for each population census tract within the nominated area is at least 20 percent. In the case of a nominated area that is within an Indian reservation, and cannot equivalently be described with census tracts, the poverty rate of the nominated area taken as a whole is considered for purposes of making this determination.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Income requirement for urban areas.</E> In the case of a nominated urban area, at least 70 percent of the households living in the nominated area must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of the local government or governments in which the nominated area is located. The number of households below 80 percent of the median income in each census tract shall be the number of households with incomes below 80 percent of the Household Adjusted Median Family Income (HAMFI) in each census tract as determined by HUD.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">HUD review of supporting data</E>—(1) <E T="03">Unemployment, poverty and income.</E> HUD will review 1990 census data to determine whether to accept a certification that a nominated area meets the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Pervasive poverty, unemployment and general distress</E>—(i) <E T="03">Pervasive poverty.</E> Pervasive poverty is demonstrated by evidence that:</P>
                <P>(A) Poverty, as indicated by the number of persons listed as being in poverty in the 1990 Decennial Census, is widespread throughout the nominated area; or</P>
                <P>(B) Poverty, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, has become entrenched or intractable over time (through comparison of 1980 and 1990 census data or other relevant evidence).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Unemployment.</E> Unemployment is demonstrated by:</P>
                <P>(A) The most recent data available indicating that the annual rate of unemployment for the nominated area is not less than the national annual average rate of unemployment; or</P>
                <P>(B) Evidence of especially severe economic conditions, such as military base or plant closings or other conditions that have brought about significant job dislocation within the nominated area.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">General distress.</E> General distress is evidenced by describing adverse conditions within the nominated urban area other than those of pervasive poverty and unemployment. Below average or decline in per capita income, earnings per worker, number of persons on welfare, per capita property tax base, average years of school completed, substantial population decline, and a high or rising incidence of crime, narcotics use, homelessness, high incidence of AIDS, abandoned housing, deteriorated infrastructure, school dropouts, teen pregnancy, incidence of domestic violence, incidence of certain health conditions and illiteracy are examples of appropriate indicators of general distress.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Ranking score.</E> Each nominated area meeting the minimum thresholds will be ranked from highest to lowest according to the area poverty rate, area unemployment rate, and for urban areas, the percentage of families below 80 percent of area median income. Urban nominated areas will be ranked separately from rural nominated areas. The percentile rank will be determined by dividing these rankings by the total number of nominated areas ranked and multiplying the result by 100. The average ranking will be determined by computing the simple average of the percentile ranks for each nominated area. To create a 100 point scale, the average rankings will be subtracted from 100.</P>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Number of points awarded.</E> A nominated area will receive 1 additional point if its 1999 Local Crime Index (LCI), as determined on the basis of data from each State and local law enforcement authority with jurisdiction in the nominated area, does not exceed by more than 25% the nation-wide 1999 Crime Index rate per 100,000 inhabitants (CI) prepared as part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. A preference of 2 points will be added to the score of a nominated area with an LCI that does not exceed the CI by more than 10 percent. A nominated area that has an LCI that is less <PRTPAGE P="331"/>than the CI will receive 4 preference points.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Qualifying for preference points.</E> To qualify for preference points based on the incidence of crime, the nominating governments must determine and then certify to the LCI determined for the nominated area, in accordance with § 599.107(a)(3)</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference points for certain census tracts.</E> A nominated area will receive one preference point if any of its census tracts is a census tract identified in GAO Report RCED-98-158R, dated May 12, 1998.
